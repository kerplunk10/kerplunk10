 >    I am a medical student currently doing a rotation in toxicology at the
 poison control center.  Today, this woman called in very upset because she
 caught her little daughter eating ants.  I quickly reassured her that the
 ants are not harmful and there would be no need to bring her daughter into
 the hospital.  She calmed down, and at the end of the conversation happened
 to mention that she gave her daughter some ant poison to eat in order to

 Emergency room right away.

 >    Idiot # 2
 >    Seems that a year ago, some Boeing employees on the airfield decided to
 steal a life raft from one of the 747s.  They were successful in getting it
 out of the plane and home.  When they took it for a float on the river, a

 activated when the raft was inflated.  They are no longer employed at

 >    Here's your sign guys.  Don't get it wet, the paint might run.
 >    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 >    Idiot # 3
 >    A true story out of San Francisco: A man, wanting to rob a downtown
 Bank of America, walked into the branch and wrote "this iz a stikkup.  Put
 all your muny in this bag."  While standing in line, waiting to give his
 note to
 >    the teller, he began to worry that someone had seen him write the note
 and might call the police before he reached the teller window.  So he left
 the Bank of America and crossed the street to Wells Fargo. After waiting a
 few minutes in line, he handed his note to the Wells Fargo teller.  He read
 it and, surmising from his spelling errors that he wasn't the brightest
 light in the harbor, told him that she could not accept his stickup note
 because it was written on a Bank of America deposit slip and that he would
 either have to fill out a Wells Fargo deposit slip or go back to Bank of
 America.  Looking somewhat defeated, the man said "OK" and left.  He was
 arrested a few minutes later, as he was waiting in line back at Bank of
 America.
 >    Don't bother with this guy's sign.  He probably couldn't read it
 anyway.

 >    Idiot # 4
 >    A motorist was unknowingly caught in an automated speed trap that
 measured his speed using radar and photographed his car.  He later received
 in the mail a ticket for $40 and a photo of his car.  Instead of payment, he
 sent the police department a photograph of $40.  Several days later, he
 received a letter from the police that contained another picture, this time
 of handcuffs.  He immediatly mailed in his $40.
 >    Another sign (though this guy might be onto something worth thinking
 about)!
 >    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 >    Idiot # 5
 >    Guy walked into a little corner store with a shotgun and demanded all
 the cash from the cash drawer.  After the cashier put the cash in a bag, the
 robber saw a bottle of scotch that he wantedbehind the counter on the shelf.
 >    He told the cashier to put it in the bag as well, but he refused and
 said, "Because I don't believe you are over 21." The robber said he was, but
 the clerk still refused to give it to him because he didn't believe him.  At
 this point the robber took his driver's license out of his wallet and gave
 it to the clerk.  The clerk looked it over, and agreed that the man was in
 fact over 21 and he put the scotch in the bag.  The robber then ran from the
 store with his loot.  The cashier promptly called the police and gave the
 name and address of the robber that he got off the license.  They arrested
 the robber two hours later.
 >    (Remind me to have more signs printed up.  Give this guy his!)

 >    Idiot # 6
 >    A pair of Michigan robbers entered a record shop nervously waving
 revolvers.  The first one shouted, "Nobody move!" When his partner moved,
 the startled first bandit shot him.

 >    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 >    Idiot # 7
 >    Arkansas: Seems this guy wanted some beer pretty badly.  He decided
 that he'd just throw a cinder block through a liquor store window, grab some
 booze, and run.  So he lifted the cinder block and heaved it over his head
 at the window.  The cinder block bounced back and hit the would-be thief on
 the head, knocking him unconscious.  Seems the liquor store window was made
 of Plexi-Glass.  The whole event was caught on videotape.  
 >    (Oh, that smarts.  Give him his sign!)
 >    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 >    Idiot # 8
 >    Ann Arbor: The Ann Arbor News crime column reported that a man walked
 into a Burger King in Ypsilanti, Michigan at 12:50 am flashed a gun and
 demanded cash.  The clerk turned him down because he said he couldn't open
 the cash register without a food order.  When the man ordered onion rings,
 the clerk said they weren't available for breakfast.  The man, frustrated,
 walked away. >>

If you want to make a lot of money and are willing to take this job back

Girl, did you see Jesse Jackson on TV.   You know how they have the news on 
around here, and Jesse came on and said, "In order to have a RECOUNT, you 
have to have the FIRST COUNT, and it's not a black and white issue, its a 
wrong or right issue".   Always trying to rhyme!   Can you believe that 
idiot.  I was too embarassed and kind of acted like I wasn't paying attention.

I understand that Jesse is "down for the cause", but his credibility is 
suffering, because he's involved in every DAMN thing.  If you're an authority 
on everything, you cannot be passionate about much at all.  He's something 
else.  He needs to pick his campaigns to bolster up his credibility!!!!

democrat?  al gore makes me sick.  enough of my ranting and raving.  what are 
you doing this weekend?  i am tired today b/c i went out last night.  this is 
a good scene.  probably not as good as miami but there is a lot going on now 
and our downtown is booming.    name some small towns that are cool to live

Okay...I'm an idiot...I forgot to bring your email address with me to London (it's saved in my contacts list at work) and I can't check my work email from outside locations...augh!  Yet again, I fail.  However, I had such a good time visiting I think I'm going to try to make a quick trip back over this fall when the air fares are a little cheaper.  That way, I could see you and Jessica and Clay.  I will stick your phone number in my physical address book and be a better visitor next go-round.

Sorry again for the oversight.  Also, the next trip I make will most likely be solo (my roommate in Houston came with me this time) so it will be significantly easier for me to maneuver.

Talk to you soon,

Any luck on the roommate front?  Do you still want me to talk to Millie?

A man asked his wife what she'd like for her birthday.   

"I'd love to be six again," she replied. 

On the morning of her birthday, he got her up bright and early and off 
they went to a local theme park.  What a day!  He put her on every 
ride in the park:  the Death Slide, the Screaming Loop, the Wall of Fear- 
everything there was!  Wow!  Five hours later she staggered out of the 
theme park, her head reeling and her stomach upside down.   Right to a 
McDonald's they went, where he husband ordered a Big Mac for her along 
with extra fries and refreshing chocolate shake.  Then it was off to a 
movie - the latest Star Wars! 

What a fabulous adventure!  Finally she wobbled home with her husband 
and collapsed into bed. 

He leaned over and lovingly asked, "Well, dear; what was it like being 
six again?"   

One eye opened, "You idiot, I meant my dress size." 

The moral of this story is:  If a woman speaks and a man is there to 
hear her, he will get it wrong anyway.

Glad you got the  package.

I view chess as one of the incontrovertible pieces of evidence that the Peter 
Principle is in operation in my life.  I know how all the pieces move but I 
can't see more than one move ahead -- proving that I am basically an idiot 
and have advanced well beyond where I long ago should have maxed out 
professionally.  So if you want someone to use to provide nearly unlimited 
examples of how to make mistakes in playing (while nevertheless following the 
rules), I'm your man.

National Girlfriends Day!

 
What would most of us do without our sisters, confidants and shopping, lunching, and traveling girls? 
Let's celebrate each other for each other's sake! 
TO MY GIRLFRIENDS! 
If you get this twice you know you have more than one girlfriend. Be Happy! 
PLEASE PASS THIS ON TO ALL OF YOUR GIRLFRIENDS AND RETURN IT TO THE 
FRIEND WHO SENT IT TO YOU! 
It is good to be a woman: 
1. We got off the Titanic first. 
2. We can scare male bosses with the mysterious gynecological disorder excuses. 
3. Taxis stop for us. 
4. We don't look like a frog in a blender when dancing. 
5. No fashion faux pas we make, could ever rival the Speedo. 
6. We don't have to pass gas to amuse ourselves. 
7. If we forget to shave, no one has to know. 
8. We can congratulate our teammate without ever touching her rear end. 
9. We never have to reach down every so often to make sure our privates are still there. 
10. We have the ability to dress ourselves. 
11. We can talk to the opposite sex without having to picture them naked. 
12. If we marry someone 20 years younger, we are aware that we will look like an idiot. 
13. We will never regret piercing our ears. 
14. There are times when chocolate really can solve all your problems. 
15. We can make comments about how silly men are in their presence because they aren't listening anyway. 
Send this to all the bright women you know and make their day!!!!!

That is ok.  I totally blanked until it was too late also.

I think that if Millie decides she likes my flat than I will have her as a
roommate.  I decided I could not deal with it right then and so I told her
she did nto have to worry about it until July.  however, i think she seems
really nice and I think it would be fun.

HAve a great day.

Okay...I'm an idiot...I forgot to bring your email address with me to
London (it's saved in my contacts list at work) and I can't check my work
email from outside locations...augh!  Yet again, I fail.  However, I had
such a good time visiting I think I'm going to try to make a quick trip
back over this fall when the air fares are a little cheaper.  That way, I
could see you and Jessica and Clay.  I will stick your phone number in my
physical address book and be a better visitor next go-round.

Sorry again for the oversight.  Also, the next trip I make will most likely
be solo (my roommate in Houston came with me this time) so it will be
significantly easier for me to maneuver.

Talk to you soon,
Susan

Any luck on the roommate front?  Do you still want me to talk to Millie?

Becky,

Well, today things suck, but overall everything is great.  I lost about $100,000 this morning because I'm an idiot, but it's not completely my fault.  Anyway, you should definitely take an earlier flight so we could go to dinner or something.  Too bad it's not at the end of week so you could stay over, even though if you wanted to, you could.  I could leave work pretty much anytime on wednesday, so just let me know.  If you don't have my work number, its 713-853-0472.  Thanks.

Mat

Hey Mat - I haven't heard from you since we played phone tag about a month
ago.  Wanted to let you know that I have a trip coming up next week and I'll
be passing through IAH Wednesday night around 9:00.  Right now my layover is
for only 50 minutes but I may be able to catch an earlier connection out of
Denver if you're going to be around that night.  If you're around I'll call
your cell on Wednesday as I'm leaving Denver & let you know if I catch the
earlier connection and maybe you can meet me at the airport for a drink.
Anyway, let me know what your plans are.

Other than being totally swamped here at work things are good.  Matt & I see
each other about once a month and we're going to Alaska for two weeks at the
beginning of August.  Let me know how things are with you.

it is so good to finally get one of these state of the unions again.  i don't 
know if i can speak for everyone, but i sure have missed it.    it is just 
good to read all the smart, witty humor again.  i especially thought the part 
about screaming "who let the dogs out" was quite funny.  it makes it 
especially funny b/c the employees play along instead of yelling out "shut up 
nerd".   as most of you know chad and i no longer live together.  it was real 
tough to see him go b/c we are pretty close, but not as close as maziarz and 
i evidently are.  but every now and then i still get reminders that i used to 
live with chad  like the other day when i was vacuming.  i decided to vacum 
behind the couch b/c i had never cleand back there.  when i looked behind the 
couch the floor was littered with about 50 toenails.    at first i was pretty 
freaked out and i was thinking how could these toenails possibly get here?  
but then i remembered i use to live with chad and he had a nasty habit of 
pulling off his toenails.  i should have figured that he didn't dispose of 
them properly.  it is good to see that chad has figured out how to use the 
email system again.  last week enron sent out a company wide email and our 
boy chad replied back to the whole company.  i felt pretty embarrassed for 
him after he sent the first reply, but went he replied to the whole company a 
second time i just thought that he was an idiot.  now he will be known as the 
guy who replied not once but twice to a company wide email.  well, i sure am 
looking foward to the next state of the union.  i know i will since i am 
going to vegas to spend all my money at the strip clubs.

Emergency calls are great.  Used it, but dinner was quick.  So the kids 
singing wasn't as good as barbara streisand's singing prayer songs?  I'm sure 
it was fun, though.  

Jeff is the king.  Already left him a message.  
I'm out dec 19-28, so do you want to try to do something this weekend--FUN.  
(I have a party to go to sat eve for a little while)  
How's the day going?  Did you talk to Beth about Pinnacle?

Did you use the emergency call?  I almost called you on your cell phone in 
case you needed another out!  I didn't get anything else at Saks but after 
the singing I got the stuff an Neiman's that I needed.  I had a freak out 
attack though b/c I thought I lost the Saks bag with the $600 bracelet in it 
and was running around Neiman's like an idiot.  Then I remembered that I 
DROVE from Saks to Neiman's and it was in my car.  I think I was just a 
little bit on edge last night!  I met my friend at Barnaby's for dinner and 
then got under the covers and finished my book.  It was great.  By the way, I 
wish I dragged you to the singing b/c Sarah, the 10 month old cutest baby on 
the planet was there.  She was clapping and singing along the whole time 
which was the cutest thing especially b/c she was on my lap the entire time.  
It was worth sitting through a horrible rendition of every Hanukkah song you 
have ever heard! 

How about your buddy Jeff!!!!  Have you congratulated him yet?  That is great!

I was at the game last night sitting in home run territory - section 154.
It was one of the most disappointing games i've ever attended.  the astros
don't even deserve to make the playoffs after their cowardly play.  the 
manager's an idiot - intentionally walking Bonds with guys on 1st and 2nd
with 2 outs.

Anyway, in terms of the Miata, the dealer recommended abt $1300 worth of work.
Of course i told him to just get the thing running ($450).  The problem is
the blue book value is only $2500 so i can't see putting another grand into it.
I'll probably just sell it to someone who races miata's (which is really big
in Texas) or donate it to charity and take the tax write off.

We haven't test driven anything yet but it looks like we're leaning toward the
BMW 330i.  It seems to get great reviews, the main downside is that it's a little
small - but still sporty.  We'll go for test drives this weekend and should buy
or lease (still undecided) something in the next couple weeks.

How's everything on your front.  Less classroom time and more flying time???

That faggot Lowery was in Austin this past weekend.  I don't expect him to call
of course but it shows how easily he could've gotten to Houston while he was 
working for 8 mos. in Dallas.

Later,

kevin

Sorry to hear about the turbo Miata.  What happened to it?  Can't it be
fixed or are you just abandoning it?  Where are you leaning in terms of a
new car?  On my end, the classic motorcycle is buzzing like  a champ and a
complete blast to drive.

What's with the faggot Astro's walking your boy?  At least he pocketed one
record.

I don't have TJ's email w/ me, but I'm sure he never expected you to

Conway,

Do you have T.J.'s new email address.  I want to let him know I
won't be out there in Oct.  Give me a shout.  How's everything going?

My miata broke down this past weekend.  I didn't think it would be
that soon.  It looks like I'm forced to buy a new car.  I'm not 
looking forward to the process although the internet should make
it less painful than it was 9.5 years ago.  Wow, I can't believe
I've owned the Miata for over 9 yrs.  

I'm going to see Bonds play on Wednesday night.  Hoping he'll be
going for the record that night (either a tie or to break it).  I
scored tix in section 154 - prime bonds territory.  Check out the
section on the Houston Astros website.

Talk to you soon.

Kev,

Real quick on the cars.  The beamer is real tight in the back seat.  Think
about how often you might be hauling 3-4 people.  If you think it's a
factor, spend some time on an extended test drive sitting in the back.  I'd
still look at the Vovlvo S-60 twin turbo, it might surprise you.

I was at the game last night sitting in home run territory - section

It was one of the most disappointing games i've ever attended.  the
astros
don't even deserve to make the playoffs after their cowardly play.  the 
manager's an idiot - intentionally walking Bonds with guys on 1st and
2nd
with 2 outs.

Anyway, in terms of the Miata, the dealer recommended abt $1300 worth of
work.
Of course i told him to just get the thing running ($450).  The problem
is
the blue book value is only $2500 so i can't see putting another grand
into it.
I'll probably just sell it to someone who races miata's (which is really
big
in Texas) or donate it to charity and take the tax write off.

We haven't test driven anything yet but it looks like we're leaning
toward the
BMW 330i.  It seems to get great reviews, the main downside is that it's
a little
small - but still sporty.  We'll go for test drives this weekend and
should buy
or lease (still undecided) something in the next couple weeks.

How's everything on your front.  Less classroom time and more flying
time???

That faggot Lowery was in Austin this past weekend.  I don't expect him
to call
of course but it shows how easily he could've gotten to Houston while he
was 
working for 8 mos. in Dallas.

Later,

Sorry to hear about the turbo Miata.  What happened to it?  Can't it be
fixed or are you just abandoning it?  Where are you leaning in terms of
a
new car?  On my end, the classic motorcycle is buzzing like  a champ and
a
complete blast to drive.

What's with the faggot Astro's walking your boy?  At least he pocketed
one
record.

Conway,

Do you have T.J.'s new email address.  I want to let him know I
won't be out there in Oct.  Give me a shout.  How's everything going?

My miata broke down this past weekend.  I didn't think it would be
that soon.  It looks like I'm forced to buy a new car.  I'm not 
looking forward to the process although the internet should make
it less painful than it was 9.5 years ago.  Wow, I can't believe
I've owned the Miata for over 9 yrs.  

I'm going to see Bonds play on Wednesday night.  Hoping he'll be
going for the record that night (either a tie or to break it).  I
scored tix in section 154 - prime bonds territory.  Check out the
section on the Houston Astros website.

Talk to you soon.

Unfortunately for this particular trip there is no flexibility in my
schedule.  The company is usually very good about this kind of stuff, but
we're in a crunch on this and many projects so it's just get out and get
back.  It looks like the best I can do getting an earlier flight is to be in
IAH by 7:55 with my flight to B'Ham at 9:55.  We'd have to get dinner at the
airport unfortunately, but it's better than nothing.  I'll call you

Becky,

Well, today things suck, but overall everything is great.  I lost about
$100,000 this morning because I'm an idiot, but it's not completely my
fault.  Anyway, you should definitely take an earlier flight so we could go
to dinner or something.  Too bad it's not at the end of week so you could
stay over, even though if you wanted to, you could.  I could leave work
pretty much anytime on wednesday, so just let me know.  If you don't have
my work number, its 713-853-0472.  Thanks.

   the

   Anyway, let me know what your plans are.

   Other than being totally swamped here at work things are good.  Matt & I
   see
   each other about once a month and we're going to Alaska for two weeks at
   the
   beginning of August.  Let me know how things are with you.

of course but it shows how easily he could've gotten to Houston while he
was 
working for 8 mos. in Dallas.

Later,

kevin

Some idiot lost a pair of pliers so I have to wait around to go fly.  I
guess it's just as well, I'd hate to find them at 3,000'.

Sorry to hear about the turbo Miata.  What happened to it?  Can't it be
fixed or are you just abandoning it?  Where are you leaning in terms of
a
new car?  On my end, the classic motorcycle is buzzing like  a champ and
a
complete blast to drive.

What's with the faggot Astro's walking your boy?  At least he pocketed
one
record.

I don't have TJ's email w/ me, but I'm sure he never expected you to
actually show up in the first place.

Conway,

Do you have T.J.'s new email address.  I want to let him know I
won't be out there in Oct.  Give me a shout.  How's everything going?

My miata broke down this past weekend.  I didn't think it would be
that soon.  It looks like I'm forced to buy a new car.  I'm not 
looking forward to the process although the internet should make
it less painful than it was 9.5 years ago.  Wow, I can't believe
I've owned the Miata for over 9 yrs.  

I'm going to see Bonds play on Wednesday night.  Hoping he'll be
going for the record that night (either a tie or to break it).  I
scored tix in section 154 - prime bonds territory.  Check out the
section on the Houston Astros website.

Talk to you soon.  

KR

Let me know if you are definitely canceling for Cali so I can set up

Ike Hilliard <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1785&>, WR NYG - Baton Rouge Idiot Updated 11/19/01
Hilliard continues to feel some soreness in his surgically-repaired toe, and it is causing him to limp around a bit. He is still expected to start in Monday's game against Minnesota, but playing on the artificial turf can't be good for his injury. 

Reggie Kelly <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=! 74! 388.6&random=679&key=133334&>, TE ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
According to published reports, Kelly (knee/ankle) should be able to return to action this weekend against Carolina. He won't make much of a Fantasy impact, however, so don't bother starting him in Week 11. 

Chad Lewis <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1755&>, TE PHI - Baton Rouge Idiot Updated 11/19/01
Lewis suffered a slight knee injury during Sunday's 36-3 win over Dallas. The injury isn't considered serious, however, and Lewis is expected to start this weekend's game against Washington. 

Steve M! cN! air <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1069&> , QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
McNair was able to play with an injury to his right thumb, but the Tennessean says he will probably miss some practice time this week. He should still be able to play in the team's next game.

Packers <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=11&>, DT GB - Manchester United Updated 11/19/01
Safety LeRoy Butler suffered a fractured left shoulder blade during Sunday's game against Atlanta. He is out indefinitely and could miss the remainder of the season. Chris Akins will likely take over the starting duties in Butler's absence. 

Steve McNair <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1069&>, QB! T! EN - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
McNair was able to play with an injury to his right thumb, but the Tennessean says he will probably miss some practice time this week. He should still be able to play in the team's next game.

Az-Zahir Hakim <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=12411&>, WR STL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Hakim left Sunday's game against New England with an ankle injury. X-rays were negative, and Hakim is listed as day to day. 

Reggie Wayne <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=235256&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Wayne suffered a sprained knee on Sunday. His current status is day to day.

Rod Smith <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1220&>, WR DEN - Dirty Bastards Updated 11/19/01
Smith (ankle) could not finish Sunday's game. His status for Thursday's game against Dallas is unclear.

Terance Mathis <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1189&>, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Mathis has by far his best game of the season, catching seven passes for 70 yards against Green Bay. He suffered a mild concussion in the game, but he's expected to be fine for this weekend's contest at Carolina. 

Jackie Harris <http://football434! .f! antasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1368&>, TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Harris suffered a strained right hamstring during Sunday's game against Philadelphia. He did not return to the contest, and is listed as day to day. 

Frank Sanders <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1184&>, WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Sanders had a huge game against Detroit on Sunday, catching seven passes for 127 yards and a touchdown. He injured his hamstring in the game, however, and is listed as day to day. 

Quincy Carter!  <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=235201&>, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Carter feels as though his hamstring has healed enough that he's ready to return to action. However, the Cowboys will start Ryan Leaf for a few more weeks before Carter gets his starting job back. The team wants to evaluate Leaf in a few games this season to determine if he'll have any trade value in the offseason. 

James Jackson <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=235220&>, RB CLE - Clubbers Updated 11/19/01
Jackson told the Cleveland Plain-Dealer it was a coach's decision not to use him against the Ravens. Jackson had been suffering from an ankle injury, but reports prior to gametime had indicated he might have been able to play. With the sudden emergence of Benjamin Gay, Jackson's Fantas! y ! value might drop greatly.

Ryan Leaf <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=12506&>, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Leaf had another terrible outing this weekend, but the Dallas Morning News is reporting that he'll remain the team's starting quarterback for the time being. However, he's no better than waiver wire fodder in Fantasy Football. 

Kevin Lockett <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1765&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Lockett left Sunday's game against Denver in the first quarter due to a rib injury. His status for next week's game against Philadelphia is uncertain at this time. 

Tony Banks <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Banks, who suffered a concussion during Sunday's game against Denver, told the Washington Post that there's a "definite possibility" he would be ready in time for next weekend's game against Philadelphia. Kent Graham would start if Banks is unable to play, but neither QB is an attractive Fantasy option against the Eagles. 

Emmitt Smith <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1094&>, RB DAL - Mandeville Marriage Updated 11/19/01
Smith left Sunday's game against Philadelphia with a sprained knee. However, he is expected to be in the starting lineup when D! al! las faces Denver on Thanksgiving Day. 

Larry Foster <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=188491&>, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Foster suffered an apparent leg injury during Sunday's game against Arizona. He is listed as day to day.

Desmond Howard <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1268&>, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Howard suffered a shoulder injury during Sunday's win over Arizona. He did not return to the game, and is listed as day to day. 

Bert Emanuel <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1186&> , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Emanuel suffered a knee injury during Sunday's game against Arizona. He is listed as day to day. 

Muhsin Muhammad <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1203&>, WR CAR - Manchester United Updated 11/18/01
Muhammad sprained his left shoulder in Sunday's game against the 49ers. His status for the Week 11 game against Atlanta is unclear.

Mike Anderson <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=187481&>, RB DEN - Dirty Bastards Updated 11/18/01
Anderson rushed for only 31 yards on 13 carries against the Redskins. Olandis Gary carried th! e ! ball 10 times for 28 yards. It is apparent Anderson is no longer worthy of a starting spot on Fantasy teams, and Gary will continue to see some work at his expense.

Michael Westbrook <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1310&>, WR WAS - Baton Rouge Idiot Updated 11/18/01
Westbrook caught nine passes for 104 yards and a TD at Denver. Opposing defenses are focusing on rookie Rod Gardner, and Westbrook is getting open often after starting the year slowly.

Jake Plummer <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1003&>, QB ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Plummer threw for 334 yards, four TDs and was intercepted once by Detroit. Such stellar performances are rare for Plummer, who may not have a better game this season.

Michael Pittman <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=12623&>, RB ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
The awful Detroit defense limited Pittman to 81 rushing yards on 23 carries. Don't start Pittman in any upcoming weeks unless your team is very thin at RB..

David Sloan <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1331&>, TE DET - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Sloan caught two TD passes for a total of three yards at Arizona. If you are desperate for help at TE, consider Sloan,! w! ho always gets regular looks from Charlie Batch.

Lamont Warren <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1112&>, RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Warren rushed for 32 yards and a TD at Arizona and caught 11 passes for 64 yards and a score. The Lions will continue to feature Warren on third downs and near the goal line as a receiver, making him a good Fantasy backup for the rest of the year.

Warrick Dunn <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1171&>, RB TB - Bees Updated 11/18/01
Dunn caught 12 passes for 138 yards against the Bears, but he rushed for only 12 yards and fumbled twice. Don't count on Dunn for consistently good Fantasy numbers during the next few weeks. He can be explosive, but he is also erratic.

Keyshawn Johnson <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1265&>, WR TB - Baton Rouge Idiot Updated 11/18/01
Johnson caught 12 passes for 89 yards against the Bears, but he failed to get in the end zone again. Don't depend on Johnson down the stretch unless your team is very thin at wideout.

Greetings from the land of watery-eyed, flat-assed office workers! How goes 
the burly mountain man thing? I've been hearing second hand from Elliot that 
you're faring extremely well mentally despite some poorly crafted sleeping 
bags and a bad case of frostbite on your toes. (That second part I made up, 
but it sounded appropriate given the sleeping bag situation.) All's well 
here. As you could imagine, and probably often do, the sweeping expanse of 
people staring at computers that is Enron has changed not at all since you 
left. There are still many computers, many of them have changed positions, 
some have gone away, most we are not sad to see go. That's just the nature of 
this cutthroat business. Also on the stagnantly invariable list is the status 
of my life in relation to Enron. I am still here. I still stare at the 
computer. Every once in awhile I meander over to the dark window-less corner 
that enshrouds the IT wizards and ask them silly questions like, "What does 
it mean when I hit this button and my screen starts flashing at me like a 
disco ball, then makes this awkward shrieking noise and finally goes black?" 
They are incredibly helpful. I am still pretty much clueless about most 
things, although I've learned to talk about them with a semblance of 
authority, as in, "No, you twit, the 25 megawatt off peak deal should clearly 
be flowing across SP-15 to NP-15 because of the illiquidity of SP's market 
right now. What kind of idiot wouldn't hedge their position in California at 
a time like this?" It all sounds very exotic and important to me, which is 
why I'm still here. But I'm infinitely jealous of your wild exploits in the 
great American outdoors. I suspect my forbearance for sitting in an office 
will run out right around the middle of the summer, so I'm planning a trip to 
coincide with that meltdown. I haven't decided between a road trip through 
the western United States or just a direct flight to Paris. Both sound good, 
and way beyond my budget, therefore equally attractive. Well, I've managed to 
say practically nothing for long enough now. I do hope you're having an 
amazing time, rambling on toward the next crazy adventure on the horizon as I 
believe Jack Kerouac once wrote. We're all very proud of you here and 
constantly refer to you as "my good friend Winston who's skiing across the 
state of Wyoming, which was my idea." I'd love to hear about your trip direct 
from the source, although I know you're extremely busy out there, skiing and 
killing wild animals for sustenance and whatnot. But please do write 
back....if you can still move your fingers.

Sincerely,
Kate
(the slightly ditsy one who sits in the middle of the room and tries to look 
constantly busy)

Hey Bro,

Yeah, I got the email from a couple of sources.  Good looking kid.  Yes, we
are getting old but I still like to get drunk and act like an idiot.  I
guess we will never grow out of that.  Last week was bitch but I think it
put everybody back into reality.  I think there will be some good out of
this.  Even though the economy will go into recession, people aren't caring
about money some much anymore.  The recession won't bring people down as
they realize their own mortality.  The recession will end quickly as soon
as Americans can get a sense of security again.  I am just going to sit
tight on my loser stocks.  There will be a huge rally in about a year.
This is going to instill a greater feeling of freedom and capitalism in the
young generation (God I am old for saying that) that we don't have.

Weird things are happenning in DC.   They must have credible evidence of
another possible attack this Saturday.  A battallion of US Army troops are
on there way up to DC from Ft. Bragg, NC.  They are only saying it is for
"added security".  I plan on staying home Saturday and working on my house.
Keep an eye out for your self Saturday.

> 4. Very quickly and calmly remind the person that

this weekend in so crazy.  We will have to do something really fun when you 
get back.  where are you going for so long?  I just got out of a three hour 
meeting.  It was so freaking boring that I wrote a long letter to my best 
friend from college.  About 15 minutes pertained to me.  To top it off, for 
lunch they had four sausage pizzas.  Yum.  Who the hell orders that?  
anyway...
write me.  I have to come pick u pa candy apple from the hyatt, but it is at 
Yolandas desk near you.  when will you be there?  I'll come say hi!

Emergency calls are great.  Used it, but dinner was quick.  So the kids 
singing wasn't as good as barbara streisand's singing prayer songs?  I'm sure 
it was fun, though.  

Jeff is the king.  Already left him a message.  
I'm out dec 19-28, so do you want to try to do something this weekend--FUN.  
(I have a party to go to sat eve for a little while)  
How's the day going?  Did you talk to Beth about Pinnacle?

Did you use the emergency call?  I almost called you on your cell phone in 
case you needed another out!  I didn't get anything else at Saks but after 
the singing I got the stuff an Neiman's that I needed.  I had a freak out 
attack though b/c I thought I lost the Saks bag with the $600 bracelet in it 
and was running around Neiman's like an idiot.  Then I remembered that I 
DROVE from Saks to Neiman's and it was in my car.  I think I was just a 
little bit on edge last night!  I met my friend at Barnaby's for dinner and 
then got under the covers and finished my book.  It was great.  By the way, I 
wish I dragged you to the singing b/c Sarah, the 10 month old cutest baby on 
the planet was there.  She was clapping and singing along the whole time 
which was the cutest thing especially b/c she was on my lap the entire time.  
It was worth sitting through a horrible rendition of every Hanukkah song you 
have ever heard! 

How about your buddy Jeff!!!!  Have you congratulated him yet?  That is great!

That glass of wine did the trick--I felt better  (more relaxed too!)  Dinner 
was boring--so I got home and had another glass of wine!

    1. Ahhh...I see the screw-up fairy has visited us again... 
      2. I don't know what your problem is, but I'll bet it's hard to 
pronounce. 
      3. How about never? Is never good for you? 
      4. I see you've set aside this special time to humiliate yourself in 
public. 
      5. I'm really easy to get along with once you people learn to worship 
me. 
      6. I'll try being nicer if you'll try being smarter. 
      7. I'm out of my mind, but feel free to leave a message... 
      8. I don't work here. I'm a consultant. 
      9. It sounds like English, but I can't understand a word you're 
saying. 
      10. I can see your point, but I still think you're full of crap. 
      11. I like you. You remind me of when I was young and stupid. 
      12. You are validating my inherent mistrust of strangers. 
      13. I have plenty of talent and vision. I just don't give a damn. 
      14. I'm already visualizing the duct tape over your mouth. 
      15. I will always cherish the initial misconceptions I had about you. 
      16. Any connection between your reality and mine is purely 
coincidental. 
      17. What am I? Flypaper for freaks!? 
      18. I'm not being rude. You're just insignificant. 
      19. It's a thankless job, but I've got a lot of Karma to burn off. 
      20. Yes, I am an agent of Satan, but my duties are largely ceremonial. 
      21. And your cry baby whiny-ass opinion would be...? 
      22. Do I look like a people person? 
      23. This isn't an office. It's Hell with fluorescent lighting. 
      24. I started out with nothing & still have most of it left. 
      25. Sarcasm is just one more service we offer. 
      26. If I throw a stick, will you leave? 
      27. Errors have been made. Others will be blamed. 
      28. Whatever kind of look you were going for, you missed. 
      29. I'm trying to imagine you with a personality. 
      30. A cubicle is just a padded cell without a door. 
      31. Can I trade this job for what's behind door #1? 
      32. Too many freaks, not enough circuses. 
      33. Nice perfume. Must you marinate in it? 
      34. Chaos, panic, & disorder -- my work here is done. 
      35. How do I set a laser printer to stun? 
      36. I thought I wanted a career, turns out I just wanted pay checks. 
      37. Your village just called..... their idiot is missing.

My miata broke down this past weekend.  I didn't think it would be

I'm going to see Bonds play on Wednesday night.  Hoping he'll be

Drive 'em both, but at least for the older one's the 8 cyl was MUCH
smoother.  It really comes down to what you want.   Unless you're really
pushing it you won't notice much of a difference.  However, what you will
notice is that the 6cyl will be working a lot harder (i.e. louder).  Once
you jump into the 5 you're in the luxury market and you probably want a
smoother car with plenty of torque (8 cyl).  Especially the way you drive
(not winding the engine out in every gear) you'll feel more low end power in
the 540.  Again, it comes down to the pax.  If you're hauling 2 most of the
time, the 530 is probably fine;. hauling 4 it will be sucking wind a bit.
Remember when you're on a test drive the car isn't configured the way it
will be in real life.  The tires will be under inflated, the gas tank (large
in that car, like 14 gal ~90 pounds) and no passengers so your performance
will seem better.  My best advice when looking at cars in that price range
is to insist on an extended (overnight or over a weekend) test drive of
both.  You don't want to buy and wish you had bought the other a couple of
weeks later.  Finally, think about long term (kids, etc) if you plan on
hanging onto it as long as the Miata.  It's not uncommon for a bimmer to go
2-300,000 miles without engine work so you can hang onto them for quite a
while if you stay up on the maintenance.  Give me a buzz at home
(301.737.5366) tonight if you want to yap about it.

Kev,

Real quick on the cars.  The beamer is real tight in the back seat.
Think
about how often you might be hauling 3-4 people.  If you think it's a
factor, spend some time on an extended test drive sitting in the back.
I'd
still look at the Vovlvo S-60 twin turbo, it might surprise you.

I was at the game last night sitting in home run territory - section
154.
It was one of the most disappointing games i've ever attended.  the
astros
don't even deserve to make the playoffs after their cowardly play.  the 
manager's an idiot - intentionally walking Bonds with guys on 1st and
2nd
with 2 outs.

Anyway, in terms of the Miata, the dealer recommended abt $1300 worth of
work.
Of course i told him to just get the thing running ($450).  The problem
is
the blue book value is only $2500 so i can't see putting another grand
into it.
I'll probably just sell it to someone who races miata's (which is really
big
in Texas) or donate it to charity and take the tax write off.

We haven't test driven anything yet but it looks like we're leaning
toward the
BMW 330i.  It seems to get great reviews, the main downside is that it's
a little
small - but still sporty.  We'll go for test drives this weekend and
should buy
or lease (still undecided) something in the next couple weeks.

How's everything on your front.  Less classroom time and more flying
time???

That faggot Lowery was in Austin this past weekend.  I don't expect him
to call
of course but it shows how easily he could've gotten to Houston while he
was 
working for 8 mos. in Dallas.

Later,

Words Women Use...

FINE ~ This is the word we use at the end of any argument that we feel we
are right about but need to shut you up. NEVER use fine to describe how a
woman looks. This will cause you to have one of those arguments.

FIVE MINUTES ~ This is half an hour. It is equivalent to the five minutes
that your football game is going to last before you take out the trash, so
I
feel that it's an even trade.

NOTHING ~ If you ask her what is wrong and she says NOTHING, this means
something and you should be on your toes. NOTHING is usually used to
describe the feeling a woman has of wanting to turn you inside out, upside
down, and backwards. "Nothing" usually signifies an argument that will last
FIVE MINUTES and end with the word FINE.

GO AHEAD (with raised eyebrows) ~ This is a dare. One that will result in a
woman getting upset over NOTHING and will end with the word FINE.
GO AHEAD (normal eyebrows) ~ This means "I give up" or "do what you want
because I don't care." You will get a raised eyebrow "Go ahead" in just a
few minutes, followed by NOTHING and FINE and she will talk to you in about
FIVE MINUTES when she cools off.

LOUD SIGH ~ This is not actually a word, but is still often a verbal
statement very misunderstood by men. A "Loud Sigh" means she thinks you are
an idiot at that moment and wonders why she is wasting her time standing
here and arguing with you over NOTHING.

SOFT SIGH ~ Again, not a word, but a verbal statement. "Soft Sighs" are one
of the few things that some men actually understand. She is content. Your
best bet is to not move or breathe and she will stay content.

THAT'S OKAY ~ This is one of the most dangerous statements that a woman can
say to a man. "That's Okay" means that she wants to think long and hard
before paying you retributions for whatever it is that you! have done.
"That's Okay" is often used with the word "Fine" and used in conjunction
with a raised eyebrow "Go ahead." At some point in the near future when she
has plotted and planned, you are going to be in some mighty big trouble.

PLEASE DO ~ This is not a statement, it is an offer. A woman is giving you
the chance to come up with whatever excuse or reason you have for doing
whatever it is that you have done. You have a fair chance to tell the
truth,
so be careful and you shouldn't get a "That's Okay."

THANKS ~ A woman is thanking you. Do not faint; just say "you're welcome."

THANKS A LOT ~ This is much different from "Thanks." A woman will say,
"Thanks A Lot" when she is really ticked off at you. It signifies that you
have hurt her in some callous way, and will be followed by the "Loud Sigh."
Be careful not to ask what is wrong after the "Loud Sigh," as she will only
tell you "Nothing."

Please send this out to ! ALL men that you know just to warn them about
future
arguments they can avoid if remembering all the terminology.

And send to all your women friends to get a good laugh!

Thanks - that's what I needed to know.  I'm still not sure if it is a two-way termination (yes I know the difference) because there's no language that indicates we'd be paid if we're in the money in a termination.  There is a provision that allows us to cease delivery "by reason of ... significant change in operating condition"; if we don't deliver, there's an LD calculation, which if positive, we have to pay.  There doesn't appear to be any language that causes WEPCo to pay us if we don't deliver and we're in the money.  (Hence my question to David) Otherwise, the only way to terminate is with one year's advance written notice - there are no Event of Default provisions and remedies, such as for bankruptcy. (Which I'm assuming you know since you're familiar with the contract).  What I didn't know was your longer term view of the market - this obviously matters in evaluating their offer if the contract is one way and we are unhedged.  In any event, for now they can either pay us the $1.2 million or we'll plan on delivering in January.  I'll call them onWed and let you know so we can schedule delivery is necessary.

Wisconsin's offer is a joke.   
 
Carl - This is is clearly a two-way termination or they would have no offer at all (I'm assuming you understand the difference).   We can buy Cal-02 Com-Ed under $30/Mwh all day long.   This is a position we will deliver on to preserve the in-the money value.   I would make it clear to Wisconsin that we intend on delivering in January and every single month thereafter because it creates positive cash flow for the estate.   We also have broker quotes that show the market is 28 at 29 for Cal 02.   I would accept nothing less  than $1.2 million.
 
Thanks.

This contract is for 50Mw peak into COMED, Seller's Daily Choice, Cal '02 @ $34.75/MWh.  Our MTM is $1,244,412; their offer is $663,000.  It appears to be a one-way contract, but it's hard to tell given the brevity of the contract.  David - what happens if we don't serve the load - do we get nothing?  We need to decide if we want to begin serving the load and negotiate a better price - they want to have done by 12/28.

Thanks for the advice.  Much appreciated.  We plan on test driving
this weekend.  The BMW has a racing track in the back of the dealership -
I heard it's pretty sweet.  I have a feeling we're going to lean toward
the 330i just b/c everything I've read rates it the best in its class.
I feel like the 5 series will be too big for us right now (w/o kids) but
we should get a better feel this weekend.  I'll keep you informed.

Thanks again.

Subject: RE: 


Drive 'em both, but at least for the older one's the 8 cyl was MUCH
smoother.  It really comes down to what you want.   Unless you're really
pushing it you won't notice much of a difference.  However, what you will
notice is that the 6cyl will be working a lot harder (i.e. louder).  Once
you jump into the 5 you're in the luxury market and you probably want a
smoother car with plenty of torque (8 cyl).  Especially the way you drive
(not winding the engine out in every gear) you'll feel more low end power in
the 540.  Again, it comes down to the pax.  If you're hauling 2 most of the
time, the 530 is probably fine;. hauling 4 it will be sucking wind a bit.
Remember when you're on a test drive the car isn't configured the way it
will be in real life.  The tires will be under inflated, the gas tank (large
in that car, like 14 gal ~90 pounds) and no passengers so your performance
will seem better.  My best advice when looking at cars in that price range
is to insist on an extended (overnight or over a weekend) test drive of
both.  You don't want to buy and wish you had bought the other a couple of
weeks later.  Finally, think about long term (kids, etc) if you plan on
hanging onto it as long as the Miata.  It's not uncommon for a bimmer to go
2-300,000 miles without engine work so you can hang onto them for quite a
while if you stay up on the maintenance.  Give me a buzz at home
(301.737.5366) tonight if you want to yap about it.

What do you think about the 530?  Isn't it basically the same thing

added size and weight?

Kev,

Real quick on the cars.  The beamer is real tight in the back seat.
Think
about how often you might be hauling 3-4 people.  If you think it's a
factor, spend some time on an extended test drive sitting in the back.
I'd
still look at the Vovlvo S-60 twin turbo, it might surprise you.

I was at the game last night sitting in home run territory - section
154.
It was one of the most disappointing games i've ever attended.  the
astros
don't even deserve to make the playoffs after their cowardly play.  the 
manager's an idiot - intentionally walking Bonds with guys on 1st and
2nd
with 2 outs.

Anyway, in terms of the Miata, the dealer recommended abt $1300 worth of
work.
Of course i told him to just get the thing running ($450).  The problem
is
the blue book value is only $2500 so i can't see putting another grand
into it.
I'll probably just sell it to someone who races miata's (which is really
big
in Texas) or donate it to charity and take the tax write off.

We haven't test driven anything yet but it looks like we're leaning
toward the
BMW 330i.  It seems to get great reviews, the main downside is that it's
a little
small - but still sporty.  We'll go for test drives this weekend and
should buy
or lease (still undecided) something in the next couple weeks.

How's everything on your front.  Less classroom time and more flying
time???

That faggot Lowery was in Austin this past weekend.  I don't expect him
to call
of course but it shows how easily he could've gotten to Houston while he
was 
working for 8 mos. in Dallas.

Later,

kevin

Sorry to hear about the turbo Miata.  What happened to it?  Can't it be
fixed or are you just abandoning it?  Where are you leaning in terms of
a
new car?  On my end, the classic motorcycle is buzzing like  a champ and
a
complete blast to drive.

What's with the faggot Astro's walking your boy?  At least he pocketed
one

Do you have T.J.'s new email address.  I want to let him know I
won't be out there in Oct.  Give me a shout.  How's everything going?

My miata broke down this past weekend.  I didn't think it would be
that soon.  It looks like I'm forced to buy a new car.  I'm not 
looking forward to the process although the internet should make
it less painful than it was 9.5 years ago.  Wow, I can't believe
I've owned the Miata for over 9 yrs.  

I'm going to see Bonds play on Wednesday night.  Hoping he'll be
going for the record that night (either a tie or to break it).  I
scored tix in section 154 - prime bonds territory.  Check out the
section on the Houston Astros website.

Talk to you soon.

 Gerald,

I am so sorry, I honestly forgot about lunch. No excuses on my part, I feel
soooo bad. If you two are not totally mad at me, then perhaps, we can really
have lunch again on me. I feel like an idiot. I hope you and Debra will
forgive me. Tell Debra I apologize for missing lunch. I will e-mail her
myself. Anyway, e-mail me back please to let me know.

Sorry,

Funny you should ask about my life right now.  Now you are sure to get an
earful!  Beware - My country is at war and going into a major recession, my
company is falling down around my feet, my grandmother is sick,  I am
broke, and my boyfriend broke up with me last week, further confirming my
ability to fail when it comes to relationships.  ( I know I act tought when
it comes to this stuff but I am really sad about this one)  I guess that I
am not sick and I do have lots of friends.  But I am tired and need someone
to take over at this point - - - -

I can't believe that you didn't get my email about gas being a buy a couple
of weeks ago.  I guess if I had seen you when I was there, I could have
told you in person.  AS for business over here, gas and power trading is
still going strong.  However, all of the events have affected us in a huge
way financially.  Down to whether we get bonuses or not.  It is not going
to be a good year just trying to stay strong but I think that we will
survive, and mostly thanks to EnronOnline.

Curious about what's going on there since you mentioned it.  Anyway - sorry
to burden you with my personal problems.  I do hope things are going ok for
you - too bad you're not going to make it here.  As we are in a cash
crunch, I think I am probobly grounded for the remainder of the year.  Who
knows!

Keep in touch -

Last night was the game to catch.  Where your seats near where the homer
dropped?

I think the 330 is the better call.  You really don't want a BMW as a family
car anyway until the kids are much older.  I don't know what the prices are
but the 330ic is pretty sweet.

I heard it's pretty sweet.  I have a feeling we're going to lean toward
the 330i just b/c everything I've read rates it the best in its class.
I feel like the 5 series will be too big for us right now (w/o kids) but
we should get a better feel this weekend.  I'll keep you informed.

Subject: RE: 


Drive 'em both, but at least for the older one's the 8 cyl was MUCH
smoother.  It really comes down to what you want.   Unless you're really
pushing it you won't notice much of a difference.  However, what you
will
notice is that the 6cyl will be working a lot harder (i.e. louder).
Once
you jump into the 5 you're in the luxury market and you probably want a
smoother car with plenty of torque (8 cyl).  Especially the way you
drive
(not winding the engine out in every gear) you'll feel more low end
power in
the 540.  Again, it comes down to the pax.  If you're hauling 2 most of
the
time, the 530 is probably fine;. hauling 4 it will be sucking wind a
bit.
Remember when you're on a test drive the car isn't configured the way it
will be in real life.  The tires will be under inflated, the gas tank
(large
in that car, like 14 gal ~90 pounds) and no passengers so your
performance
will seem better.  My best advice when looking at cars in that price
range
is to insist on an extended (overnight or over a weekend) test drive of
both.  You don't want to buy and wish you had bought the other a couple
of
weeks later.  Finally, think about long term (kids, etc) if you plan on
hanging onto it as long as the Miata.  It's not uncommon for a bimmer to
go
2-300,000 miles without engine work so you can hang onto them for quite
a
while if you stay up on the maintenance.  Give me a buzz at home
(301.737.5366) tonight if you want to yap about it.

Kev,

Real quick on the cars.  The beamer is real tight in the back seat.
Think
about how often you might be hauling 3-4 people.  If you think it's a
factor, spend some time on an extended test drive sitting in the back.
I'd
still look at the Vovlvo S-60 twin turbo, it might surprise you.

I was at the game last night sitting in home run territory - section
154.
It was one of the most disappointing games i've ever attended.  the
astros
don't even deserve to make the playoffs after their cowardly play.  the 
manager's an idiot - intentionally walking Bonds with guys on 1st and
2nd
with 2 outs.

Anyway, in terms of the Miata, the dealer recommended abt $1300 worth of
work.
Of course i told him to just get the thing running ($450).  The problem
is
the blue book value is only $2500 so i can't see putting another grand
into it.
I'll probably just sell it to someone who races miata's (which is really
big
in Texas) or donate it to charity and take the tax write off.

We haven't test driven anything yet but it looks like we're leaning
toward the
BMW 330i.  It seems to get great reviews, the main downside is that it's
a little
small - but still sporty.  We'll go for test drives this weekend and
should buy
or lease (still undecided) something in the next couple weeks.

How's everything on your front.  Less classroom time and more flying
time???

That faggot Lowery was in Austin this past weekend.  I don't expect him
to call
of course but it shows how easily he could've gotten to Houston while he
was 
working for 8 mos. in Dallas.

Later,

My miata broke down this past weekend.  I didn't think it would be
that soon.  It looks like I'm forced to buy a new car.  I'm not 
looking forward to the process although the internet should make
it less painful than it was 9.5 years ago.  Wow, I can't believe
I've owned the Miata for over 9 yrs.  

I'm going to see Bonds play on Wednesday night.  Hoping he'll be
going for the record that night (either a tie or to break it).  I
scored tix in section 154 - prime bonds territory.  Check out the
section on the Houston Astros website.

Your plans for a summer escape sound fun.  But what you should really do is
come out to Jackson with Elliot at the beginning of May.  We're planning a
debauched weekend here right after we finish a section of the trip.  Should
be fun.  Just the thing for relieving stress from staring at the screen.  By
the way, have you seen the movie Office Space?  I'd recommend it.

Please check that Elliot is actually working from time to time.  He does
this routine where he'll have a bunch of things up on his screen, but his
eyes are actually closed.  Whenever you see that, just throw something at
him.  Of call his phone and says it's Jeff Skilling.

Hope all is well in sunny Portland.  Keep me posted on any unseemly office
gossip.

Talk to you soon.

Winston

Words Women Use...

FINE ~ This is the word we use at the end of any argument that we feel we
are right about but need to shut you up. NEVER use fine to describe how a
woman looks. This will cause you to have one of those arguments.

FIVE MINUTES ~ This is half an hour. It is equivalent to the five minutes
that your football game is going to last before you take out the trash, so
I
feel that it's an even trade.

NOTHING ~ If you ask her what is wrong and she says NOTHING, this means
something and you should be on your toes. NOTHING is usually used to
describe the feeling a woman has of wanting to turn you inside out, upside
down, and backwards. "Nothing" usually signifies an argument that will last
FIVE MINUTES and end with the word FINE.

GO AHEAD (with raised eyebrows) ~ This is a dare. One that will result in a
woman getting upset over NOTHING and will end with the word FINE.
GO AHEAD (normal eyebrows) ~ This means "I give up" or "do what you want
because I don't care." You will get a raised eyebrow "Go ahead" in just a
few minutes, followed by NOTHING and FINE and she will talk to you in about
FIVE MINUTES when she cools off.

LOUD SIGH ~ This is not actually a word, but is still often a verbal
statement very misunderstood by men. A "Loud Sigh" means she thinks you are
an idiot at that moment and wonders why she is wasting her time standing
here and arguing with you over NOTHING.

SOFT SIGH ~ Again, not a word, but a verbal statement. "Soft Sighs" are one
of the few things that some men actually understand. She is content. Your
best bet is to not move or breathe and she will stay content.

THAT'S OKAY ~ This is one of the most dangerous statements that a woman can
say to a man. "That's Okay" means that she wants to think long and hard
before paying you retributions for whatever it is that you! have done.
"That's Okay" is often used with the word "Fine" and used in conjunction
with a raised eyebrow "Go ahead." At some point in the near future when she
has plotted and planned, you are going to be in some mighty big trouble.

PLEASE DO ~ This is not a statement, it is an offer. A woman is giving you
the chance to come up with whatever excuse or reason you have for doing
whatever it is that you have done. You have a fair chance to tell the
truth,
so be careful and you shouldn't get a "That's Okay."

THANKS ~ A woman is thanking you. Do not faint; just say "you're welcome."

THANKS A LOT ~ This is much different from "Thanks." A woman will say,
"Thanks A Lot" when she is really ticked off at you. It signifies that you
have hurt her in some callous way, and will be followed by the "Loud Sigh."
Be careful not to ask what is wrong after the "Loud Sigh," as she will only
tell you "Nothing."

Please send this out to ! ALL men that you know just to warn them about
future
arguments they can avoid if remembering all the terminology.

And send to all your women friends to get a good laugh!

I think the only difference btw the 330Ci and the 330i is that the Ci
is a 2 door.  

Had a choice btw Wed and Thur game - chose Wed.  Not that disappointed
though as the Astros proved to be the biggest bunch of pussies in the
ML.  They were more concerned with not giving up a homer to Bonds than
with winning the game.  Now they stand a chance of not making the playoffs
at all.  If you ask me they don't deserve it and the mgr should be fired.

It was great to hear the fans booing the home team every other inning.  I'm
sure they lost a lot of fans over those 2 games.

Anyway, what's up on your front.  Are you still going out to Cali to visit
Hop and Denise?  How's flying?

I think the 330 is the better call.  You really don't want a BMW as a family
car anyway until the kids are much older.  I don't know what the prices are
but the 330ic is pretty sweet.

Subject: RE: 


Drive 'em both, but at least for the older one's the 8 cyl was MUCH
smoother.  It really comes down to what you want.   Unless you're really
pushing it you won't notice much of a difference.  However, what you
will
notice is that the 6cyl will be working a lot harder (i.e. louder).
Once
you jump into the 5 you're in the luxury market and you probably want a
smoother car with plenty of torque (8 cyl).  Especially the way you
drive
(not winding the engine out in every gear) you'll feel more low end
power in
the 540.  Again, it comes down to the pax.  If you're hauling 2 most of
the
time, the 530 is probably fine;. hauling 4 it will be sucking wind a
bit.
Remember when you're on a test drive the car isn't configured the way it
will be in real life.  The tires will be under inflated, the gas tank
(large
in that car, like 14 gal ~90 pounds) and no passengers so your
performance
will seem better.  My best advice when looking at cars in that price
range
is to insist on an extended (overnight or over a weekend) test drive of
both.  You don't want to buy and wish you had bought the other a couple
of
weeks later.  Finally, think about long term (kids, etc) if you plan on
hanging onto it as long as the Miata.  It's not uncommon for a bimmer to
go
2-300,000 miles without engine work so you can hang onto them for quite
a
while if you stay up on the maintenance.  Give me a buzz at home
(301.737.5366) tonight if you want to yap about it.

Real quick on the cars.  The beamer is real tight in the back seat.
Think
about how often you might be hauling 3-4 people.  If you think it's a
factor, spend some time on an extended test drive sitting in the back.
I'd
still look at the Vovlvo S-60 twin turbo, it might surprise you.

I was at the game last night sitting in home run territory - section
154.
It was one of the most disappointing games i've ever attended.  the
astros
don't even deserve to make the playoffs after their cowardly play.  the 
manager's an idiot - intentionally walking Bonds with guys on 1st and
2nd
with 2 outs.

Anyway, in terms of the Miata, the dealer recommended abt $1300 worth of
work.
Of course i told him to just get the thing running ($450).  The problem
is
the blue book value is only $2500 so i can't see putting another grand
into it.
I'll probably just sell it to someone who races miata's (which is really
big
in Texas) or donate it to charity and take the tax write off.

We haven't test driven anything yet but it looks like we're leaning
toward the
BMW 330i.  It seems to get great reviews, the main downside is that it's
a little
small - but still sporty.  We'll go for test drives this weekend and
should buy
or lease (still undecided) something in the next couple weeks.

How's everything on your front.  Less classroom time and more flying
time???

That faggot Lowery was in Austin this past weekend.  I don't expect him
to call
of course but it shows how easily he could've gotten to Houston while he
was 
working for 8 mos. in Dallas.

Later,

My miata broke down this past weekend.  I didn't think it would be
that soon.  It looks like I'm forced to buy a new car.  I'm not 
looking forward to the process although the internet should make
it less painful than it was 9.5 years ago.  Wow, I can't believe
I've owned the Miata for over 9 yrs.  

I'm going to see Bonds play on Wednesday night.  Hoping he'll be
going for the record that night (either a tie or to break it).  I
scored tix in section 154 - prime bonds territory.  Check out the
section on the Houston Astros website.

Talk to you soon.

Hi Kate,

Thanks for the email.  Sorry it's taken me a while to respond but it's chaos
here as we prepare to head off for the next part of our trip today.  Glad to
hear the glow of the screen still has you enthralled.  Keep hitting F9 and
all will be well.  The bit when the screen flashes like a disco ball means
your pay is being cut.  I hope all those hideous applications I built that
you were using haven't blown sky high.  But you know I did put little bugs
in all of those things so that they would stop working about 4 months after
I left.  Sorry!  I neede to ensure there would be work for me to do when/if
I come back.

Your plans for a summer escape sound fun.  But what you should really do is
come out to Jackson with Elliot at the beginning of May.  We're planning a
debauched weekend here right after we finish a section of the trip.  Should
be fun.  Just the thing for relieving stress from staring at the screen.  By
the way, have you seen the movie Office Space?  I'd recommend it.

Please check that Elliot is actually working from time to time.  He does
this routine where he'll have a bunch of things up on his screen, but his
eyes are actually closed.  Whenever you see that, just throw something at
him.  Of call his phone and says it's Jeff Skilling.

Hope all is well in sunny Portland.  Keep me posted on any unseemly office
gossip.

Talk to you soon.

Winston

A little summary of my travels so far!
 
 
After several e-mails back to myself, I believe I have figured out how to use this keyboard and the writing ?s hopefully readable {The poor grammar cannot be blamed on the keyboard though}.
 
On the plane over here, I met a turkish girl who used to be an english teacher, and hence spoke very good english.  I ended up staying at her place my first night in Turkey, she was going to give me a ride to my hotel but did not want to venture into the area in which the hotel was booked (don't trust everything you read on the internet!).  The plane got in very late, and I had not slept at all and was very tired.  A nice muslim priest decided to serenade me at 4:30 am from the mosque just down the hill, and my attempt at sleep ended.  Turns out muslims must pray five times a day, and the mosques blare out prayers to ensure that you don't forget.
 
  We had breakfast on the bosphorus the following morning, where I was able to learn a little bit about the traffic laws in Turkey.  We were eating across the street from a police station on a one way road, yet that didn't stop anyone from driving the wrong way down the one way!  They drive like maniacs here, and are encouraged as far as I can tell.  The traffic lights in the towns actually have a countdown timer on them, and the light goes from red to yellow to green, just like at a racetrack!  Go figure!
 
I got on a bus to head south, and learned several things about Turkish culture and myself!  First, very few turkish speak english (I had kinda assumed that they all spoke english after taking to an english teacher on the plane), secondly, I cant speak Turkish!  After a while, I managed to write down where I wanted to go and found someone to point me in the proper direction.  The buses here are awesome, they give you coffee and tea, cookies and some lemon smelling stuff to put on your hands.  Partway through the trip some army guys got on the bus, and a guy with a big machine gun came and sat down beside me.  He stunk but I was not about to tell him so!!
 
 I spent my first day touring the battlefields of Galipolli, with several Australians and New Zealanders.  The tourguide was awesome, and the site was really neat (although very few Canadians fought there).  I got back on a bus that evening and traveled to a town down south.  I met some New Yorkers on the bus, and they made me question my decision to go to school ?n the US.  One of the girls had no clue where Calgary was, until I explained to here that it was just north of Montana, it was the typical 'Speak American Please!'
 
On Saturday I toured the ancient ruins at Pergamum, which are located above the town of Bergama on top of a huge hill.  I decided after touring that I would walk back to town (about 5k),  wearing my big backpack ?n 35C heat!  After walking all the way down the hill, I got to the barbwire topped fence surrounding the ruins, I felt like an idiot but there was no way I was climbing back up the hill!  There were several young local guys running down the road, and I asked them for help.  There only suggestion was to jump the fence (explained by hand signals because they spoke little english),  and I figured it was worth a try!  I managed to get over the barbwire with my backpack and only cut up my knee a little bit.  They walked back to the village with me, and wanted me to pay for them to go to the other historical sites (I think?).  I took off faster than having being chased by an angry old man after snowballing cars, and hopped! on the next bus out of town.
 
Sunday I toured the ruins of Ephesus, which were really neat, and saw an old roman theater that Elton John had played in April.  Sunday I went up to the travertines at Pamukale, one of the seven wonders of the Ancient World.  The hillside is covered with calcium deposits, and there is water running down which collects in these pools where you were once allowed to swim (no longer because they were being destroyed).  Today I am sitting in a port town called Bodrum, and have just finished touring a ancient castle, and am heading to the mausoleum (another of the seven wonders!).  Following this, I am going to go to Marmaris and get on a sailboat tomorrow for a four day trip around many small islands in the Mediterranean Sea.
 
Hope all is well in Calgary, and will keep you all up to date through my journeys!
 
Jeff

Update time. What is the latest on the job hunt? Since talking w/ you I have seen so many articles coming out on how difficult it is for the recent grads to find employment. I was hoping that I could be of more help to you, but Enron is long people right now. I do feel like I can be of some help by year-end, but I realize that doesn't help you rt now. I am spending pretty much every week in Houston until year end trying to get one of our internal units sorted out.  Maybe we can try to hook up one weekend in Houston, if not, I will see before the year is out.

				PS. Rachel is coming in to town this month and she wants to make sure she gets a chance to see you. I will find out exact dates and send them to you.

I used to carpool with a guy and his wife from Liberty.   He asked me one day:  " what if someone called you and told you that you just won a new Towncar - all you had to pay was the $700 in  taxes?"    I told both of them (laughing)  that it was a scam and someone would have to be an idiot to fall for that,  since they didnt enter any contest.
They both looked down at their feet and said that they sent a check to this outfit.    I called them dumbasses again and they called their bank to cancel the check.

The jackass scam artist called them back,  bitching that they had cancelled their check.    My dumbass friend was talked into this transaction AGAIN.
He tried to reinstate the check ,  but the bank's policy prevented him from reactivating this payment.    He was going to do this again,  but I told his in-laws,  friends and everyone else I could to talk to him.   He finally saw the light.   Just doing my job.

Anyway,  this guy is a super nice (but dumbass) guy.    He works at the Harris county courthouse.    His wife ran off with a crack head,  left him with the kids,    didnt come homefor several weeks and then wanted a divorce.    The divorce was in Liberty where this woman,  also a dumbass friend from wayback,   had worked for the Judge presiding over her case.     
She got the kids and he pays $2500/month.

Life is less fair to dumbasses

Not sure if you knew of this or not...

DON'T EVER DIAL AREA CODE 809

This one is being distributed all over the U.S.  This
is pretty scary - especially given the way they try to
get you to call.  Be sure you read this and pass it on
to all your friends, family and business associates so
they don't get scammed!!  THIS IS A MAJOR SCAM.

Don't respond to E-Mails, phone calls or web pages
which tell you to call an "809" phone number.  This is
a very important issue of Scam Busters because it
alerts you to a scam that is spreading "extremely"
quickly.  This can easily cost you $24,100.00 or more
and is difficult to avoid unless you are aware of it.
We'd like to thank Verizon for bringing this scam to
our attention.  This scam has also been identified by
the National Fraud Information Center and is costing
victims a lot of money.

There are lots of different permutations of this scam,
but HERE'S HOW IT WORKS. You will receive a message on
your answering machine, voice mail, etc, asking you to
call a number beginning with the area code 809.  The
reasons you are asked to call varies.  It can be to
receive information about a family member who has been
ill, to tell you someone you know has been arrested,
died, to let you know you have won a wonderful prize,
etc.  In each case, you are told to call the 809
number right away.  Since there are so many new area
codes these days, people unknowingly return these
calls.  If you call from the U.S., you will apparently
be charged $2,425.00 per minute.  Or. you will get a
long recorded message.  The point is, they will try to
keep you on the phone as long as possible to increase
the charges.  Unfortunately, when you get your phone
bill, you'll often be charged more than $24,100.00.

WHY IT WORKS:  The 809 area code number is located in
the British Virgin Islands (The Bahamas).  The 809
area code can be used as a "pay-per-call" number,
similar to 900 numbers in the U.S.  Since 809 is not
in the U.S., it is not covered by U.S. regulations of
900 numbers, which require that you be notified and
warned of charges and rates involved when you call a
"pay-per-call" number.  There is also no requirement
that the company provide a time period during which
you may terminate the call without being charged.
Furthermore, whereas many U.S. phones have 900 number
blocking to avoid these kinds of charges.  900 number
blocking will not prevent calls to the 809 area code.
We recommend that no matter how you get the message,
if you are asked to call a number with an 809 area
code that you don't recognize and/orinvestigate
further and just disregard the message.  Be wary of
E-Mail or calls asking you to call an 809 area code
num! ber.  It's important to prevent becoming a victim
of this scam since trying to fight the charges
afterwards can become a real nightmare.

That's because you did actually make the call.  If you
complain, both your local phone company and your long
distance carrier will not want to get involved.  They
will most likely tell you that they are simply
providing the billing for the foreign company.  You'll
end up dealing with a foreign company that argues they
have done nothing wrong.  Please forward this entire
message to all of your friends, family and colleagues
to help them become aware of this scam

=================================================================
YOUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED

Q. What's an order imbalance?

A. Order imbalances happen on stock exchanges such as the New
York Stock Exchange (NYSE) when there are too many buy orders
and not enough sell orders -- or vice versa. When they occur,
the exchange might halt trading temporarily, to allow more of
the other kind of order to come in. This permits better matching
of buyers and sellers, and makes prices less volatile.

You might see order imbalances happen whenever there's very good
or bad news related to a company and suddenly many people want
in or out of it.

The Nasdaq stock market, meanwhile, operates on more of a
supply-and-demand basis, with its trading conducted between many
market participants. It doesn't halt trading for order
imbalances.


Q. Don't you think that anyone who doesn't sell a stock near its
all-time high is a fool?

A. A Fool with a capital "F," maybe, but not an idiot. It's true
that many stocks are now down considerably from their all-time
highs. But few stocks ever go up in a straight line. And any
stock that continually rises will continually set all-time
highs. It's not consistently possible to know what a stock will
do in the short term, so we avoid trying to carefully time
purchases or sales.

If you're ever holding onto stock in a company whose future
doesn't look too bright or stock that seems grossly overvalued,
you might do well to sell But those of us who have long-term
faith in a company and expect its price to be significantly
higher in the decades ahead, we'll often do well just happily
hanging on. Many volatile but solid stocks have often been
halved, only to double and quadruple again.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
THIS WEEK'S LESSON

COMMON FINANCIAL MISTAKES

Be smart about managing your money. Here are some common
financial mistakes, and a few resources to help you avoid them:

- Racking up credit card debt. It feels like free money, but it
  isn't. High interest rates increase your debt, making it harder
  and harder to pay off. That's reverse investing! Remedy: Find
  our nine ways to pay it back.
  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=409221

- Not investing soon enough. You're rarely too young or too old
  to invest. Kids have the most to gain from many decades of stock
  appreciation. But even retirees can benefit from leaving in
  stocks whatever money they won't need for five or ten years.
  Remedy: See how you can start investing with only $20 a month.
  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=409222

- Investing too conservatively. Any long-term investment is
  likely to grow most rapidly in stocks.

- Over- or under-diversifying. If all your eggs are in two or
  three baskets, you're exposed to too much risk. If you have too
  many baskets to count, then you probably aren't able to keep up
  with each company. Between five and 15 stocks is a manageable
  number for most people. . Remedy: Index funds are a great place
  to start.
  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=409223

- Focusing inordinately on a stock's price. Contrary to popular
  opinion, a "cheap" stock isn't a bargain. Penny stocks, those
  trading for less than $5 each, are risky and dangerous. A $150
  stock can actually be a bargain, and if your funds are limited,
  you can always just buy a few shares.

- Investing in what you don't understand. The more familiar you
  are with how your company works and how well it's performing,
  the fewer unpleasant surprises you're likely to encounter.

- Relying on the advice of others. It's great to learn from
  others, but ultimately you should make your own decisions.
  You're the one who cares the most about your finances.

- Not tracking your returns. Shrug off this duty at your own
  peril. You always want to be (in the long run) beating a
  benchmark such as the S&P 500. If you're not beating it, you
  might as well meet it, by investing in an index fund. Remedy:
  Track your portfolio for free on our website.
  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=409224

- Impatience. Building great wealth takes time.

Perhaps the worst mistake is never taking the time to learn
about investing. You're not making that one, though, if you're
reading and thinking about this article!

FYI....

This change went in for the Deal Validation group.   It gives them the 
ability to change counterparties names after bridge back.

Impact to Logistics - Unify
If a counterparty name change takes place to deals that have been bridge 
backed, it could cause problems on EDI pipes as that new counterparty name 
will flow over to Unify and repathing should eventually take place.
One problem may be with the Imbalance data sets, which are not in production 
yet......(EDI Imbalance Qtys would not match up to paths)
This may also cause an issue with the scheduled quantities (especially where 
nominations were sent for entire month)
can't remember the rules on this one, but I think Unify does have some safe 
guards (idiot proofs) to force re-pathing.
Unify does have the ability to over-ride duns numbers, yet would still cause 
an additional step for EDI the scheduler would need to think through in order 
to get a clean quick response.
What are (if any) impacts to Vol Mgt if counterparty name changes take 
place?  (prior periods?  re-pathing?)

I have a call into Diane and Dave both.  After speaking w/ them, hopefully I 
can get a clear understanding of the true impact.  I am sure we'll need to 
put some processes and procedures together for Deal Validation to follow when 
these type of changes are needed.

Will keep you posted.

Thanks,

dg

Subject: Sitara Release (Re: Changes in Global due to Consent to Assignment)


Regarding the ability to change counterparties on deals in SITARA with 
confirmed volumes - Tom's words of caution:

If someone calls you and wants to change a counterparty - we created the 
ability for you to invalidate the deal - and 
then change the counterparty - however - I did add a warning message:

"Warning - changing counterparty on deal with confirmed volumes - make sure 
pipeline allows this change."   

Some pipelines do not allow us to change counterparties after there is 
feedback - I assume for the same reasons
we had this rule - it used to blow up our old scheduling systems 
(pre-UNIFY).  Some pipelines will require a new 
deal and we will have to zero out the old deal.

Before you make the change - make sure the logistics person is aware - just 
in case it causes problems with their
pipeline.   Sorry - I don't know which pipes these are - you will have to ask 
the UNIFY team.

There is one rule still in place - you can change from ENA-IM East to ENA-IM 
Market East - but not from 
ENA-IM Texas to HPLC-IM HPLC - when changing business units - they must be 
the same legal entity. 
"Warning - not the same legal entity"

Also - beware of making contract and counterparty changes to Service deals 
(Transport Capacity, Storage, Cash Out).
Once the deal is invalidated - there are no rules.  Don't forget - the items 
were locked down for a reason.
 If you invalidate a service deal - and change the previously locked down 
data that was validated - and someone used these
deals in UNIFY - it is highly likely that the UNIFY deals and paths created 
using these deals will get corrupted.  Always check 
with someone from UNIFY to make sure no one used these deals for anything in 
UNIFY.

Subject: Sitara Release (Re: Changes in Global due to Consent to Assignment)  

With the release that was put out Tuesday evening, Deal Validation should be 
able to change the counterparty on deals where the volume is something other 
than expected (e.g. confirmed, nominated, scheduled, etc.).  

In addition, this release will also capture "near-time" the contract changes 
that are made in global.  This means that need for server bounces will not be 
necessary.

 New/Changes to contracts will show up without having to get out of deal 
manager.
 New Counterparties, and new/changes to facilities will require getting out 
of all active Sitara apps (except for launch pad).  
  Once out of all apps, start a new app - the respective information that you 
are looking for will appear.

I mention "near-time" because we are constrained by the amount of time it 
takes for the change in Global data to trigger an alert for Sitara who then 
updates its information

Latest NFL Player News - Provided by Commissioner.COM

Muhsin Muhammad <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=1203&>, WR CAR - Manchester United Updated 11/18/01
Muhammad sprained his left shoulder in Sunday's game against the 49ers. His status for the Week 11 game against Atlanta is unclear.

Mike Anderson <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=187481&>, RB DEN - Dirty Bastards Updated 11/18/01! Anderson rushed for only 31 yards on 13 carries against the Redskins. Olandis Gary carried the ball 10 times for 28 yards. It is apparent Anderson is no longer worthy of a starting spot on Fantasy teams, and Gary will continue to see some work at his expense.

Michael Westbrook <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=1310&>, WR WAS - Baton Rouge Idiot Updated 11/18/01
Westbrook caught nine passes for 104 yards and a TD at Denver. Opposing defenses are focusing on rookie Rod Gardner, and Westbrook is getting open often after starting the year slowly.

Jake Plummer <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=1003&>, QB ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/18! /0! 1
Plummer threw for 334 yards, four TDs and was intercepted once by Detroit. Such stellar performances are rare for Plummer, who may not have a better game this season.

Michael Pittman <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=12623&>, RB ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
The awful Detroit defense limited Pittman to 81 rushing yards on 23 carries. Don't start Pittman in any upcoming weeks unless your team is very thin at RB..

David Sloan <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=1331&>, TE DET - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Sloan caught two TD passes for a total of three yards at Arizona. If you ! ar! e desperate for help at TE, consider Sloan, who always gets regular looks from Charlie Batch.

Lamont Warren <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=1112&>, RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Warren rushed for 32 yards and a TD at Arizona and caught 11 passes for 64 yards and a score. The Lions will continue to feature Warren on third downs and near the goal line as a receiver, making him a good Fantasy backup for the rest of the year.

Warrick Dunn <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=1171&>, RB TB - Bees Updated 11/18/01
Dunn caught 12 passes for 138 yards against the Bears, but he rushed for only 12 yards and fumbled twice. Don't count on Dunn for consistently good Fantasy numbers during the next few weeks. He can be explosive, but he is also erratic.

Keyshawn Johnson <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=1265&>, WR TB - Baton Rouge Idiot Updated 11/18/01
Johnson caught 12 passes for 89 yards against the Bears, but he failed to get in the end zone again. Don't depend on Johnson down the stretch unless your team is very thin at wideout.

David Terrell <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=235247&>, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Terrell ca! ug! ht one pass for 15 yards at Tampa Bay. The rookie wideout is not consistent enough to start for most Fantasy teams.

Marty Booker <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=133228&>, WR CHI - Anorexic Drunks Updated 11/18/01
Booker caught seven passes for 165 yards and three TDs at Tampa Bay. In his third season, Booker has become a superb Fantasy wideout. He is a player you must start every week, no matter what matchup he faces. 

Plaxico Burress <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=187385&>, WR PIT - Bees Updated 11/18/01
The Jaguars limited Burress to one catch for 13 yards. The second-year receiver has still not proven he can be a reliable Fantasy player.

LaDainian Tomlinson <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=235249&>, RB SD - Bees Updated 11/18/01
Tomlinson put up decent rushing numbers against Oakland, posting 68 yards and a touchdown. His overall statistics have been down in recent weeks, however, which may have something to do with the fact that he held out for the entire preseason. 

Hines Ward <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=12795&>, WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Ward caught nine passes for 112 yards and a TD against Jacks! on! ville. While he doesn't score often, Ward has become a very solid receiver for Pittsburgh this year, and he will always post respectable totals.

Doug Flutie <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=12375&>, QB SD - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Flutie's recent struggles continued against Oakland, throwing for only 98 yards on Sunday. Unless he faces a good matchup, starting Flutie is becoming somewhat of a gamble. 

Stacey Mack <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=134327&>, RB JAC - Manchester United Updated 11/18/01
Mack was held to six rushing yards on eight carries at Pittsburgh. He has not been a reliable back for the Jaguars or Fantasy owners this season.

Rich Gannon <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=1034&>, QB OAK - Mandeville Marriage Updated 11/18/01
Gannon had a solid outing against San Diego, throwing for 311 yards and four touchdowns. He's one of the top five Fantasy quarterbacks in the league and is a must-start every week. 

Jerry Rice <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=1291&>, WR OAK - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Rice had a huge game on Sunday, catching eight passes for 131 yards and three touchdowns against San Diego. R! ic! e may not be an every-week starter in smaller leagues, but he can certainly still put up huge Fantasy numbers when the matchup is right. 

Tony Banks <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Banks was carted off the field in the second quarter of Sunday's game at Denver with a concussion. He was replaced by Kent Graham.

Brett Favre <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=1028&>, QB GB - Team Sensitive Updated 11/18/01
Favre threw for 262 yards and two TDs against the Falcons, but he was intercepted three times and lost a fumble. Despite some inconsistent play in recent weeks, Favre's potential for big games makes him a must-start every week.

Corey Bradford <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=12234&>, WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Bradford caught three passes for 117 yards against Atlanta. The Green Bay wideout is still too inconsistent to be considered a solid Fantasy player.

Chris Chandler <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=1004&>, QB ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Chandler started at Green Bay, and threw for 352 yards, two TD! s ! and two interceptions. He remains a good Fantasy backup when healthy.

Bob Christian <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=1077&>, RB ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Christian rushed for 40 yards and caught five passes for 62 yards at Green Bay. The Falcons are using him more often, and Christian makes a good backup RB right now.

Elvis Grbac <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=1035&>, QB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Grbac threw for 261 yards, two TDs and was intercepted four times by the Browns. The veteran QB has been a big disappointment this year and should not start for most Fantasy teams.

Jason Brookins <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=192266&>, RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Brookins rushed for 89 yards on 21 carries against the Browns. The rookie is a servicable, yet unspectacular Fantasy player who should give you some occasional TDs down the stretch. 

Tim Couch <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=133260&>, QB CLE - Bees Updated 11/18/01
Couch threw for only 144 yards and was intercepted three times at Baltimore. The Cleveland QB appears to be a risk even as a Fantasy backup right now.

Benjamin Gay <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844! &k! ey=245054&>, RB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Gay saw his first extensive action of the year, carrying the ball 18 times for 56 yards and a TD at Baltimore. He displayed good vision and lateral quickness, and Gay is definitely worth picking up if you need help at RB. 

James Jackson <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=235220&>, RB CLE - Clubbers Updated 11/18/01
Jackson (ankle) did not play at Baltimore. Benjamin Gay and Jamel White shared carries in his place. 

Lamar Smith <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=1160&>, RB MIA - Manchester United Updated 11/18/01
Smith rushed for only 53 yards on 19 carries against the Jets. Smith appears to be mired in mediocrity right now, and he is a risky start unless you lack depth at RB.

Chris Chambers <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=235203&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
The rookie wideout caught only two passes for 25 yards against the Jets. Chambers is still too inconsistent to start for most Fantasy teams.

NFL Reports, Player Updates 	
Latest NFL Player News - Provided by Commissioner.COM

Keenan McCardell <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=213&key=1235&>, WR JAC - Clubbers Updated 11/25/01
McCardell caught six passes for 80 yards against Baltimore. He has certainly raised the level of his play in recent weeks, and should be a solid Fantasy player down the stretch as opponents continue to focus on Jimmy Smith.

Sta! ce! y Mack <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=213&key=134327&>, RB JAC - Manchester United Updated 11/25/01
Mack rushed for 50 yards and two TDs and caught five passes for 45 yards against the Ravens. Despite his good outing, Mack remains a Fantasy risk because of his inconsistency. 

Qadry Ismail <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=213&key=1514&>, WR BAL - Team Sensitive Updated 11/25/01
The Jaguars held Ismail to three catches for 44 yards. Despite his quiet statistical performance, Ismail remains a must-start player for any Fantasy team. He is one of the most complete and underrated receivers in the AFC.

Jason Brookins <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=213&key=192266&>, RB BAL - Free ! Ag! ent Updated 11/25/01
Brookins rushed for 82 yards and two TDs at Jacksonville, but also lost a fumble. The rookie RB is talented, but too erratic to be a Fantasy starter on most teams right now.

Ron Dayne <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=213&key=187386&>, RB NYG - Clubbers Updated 11/25/01
Dayne carried the ball six times for 26 yards against Oakland. Don't depend on him for good numbers during the remainder of the season.

Tiki Barber <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=213&key=1782&>, RB NYG - Baton Rouge Idiot Updated 11/25/01
Barber rushed for 124 yards and a TD against Oakland, and caug! ht! five passes for 41 yards. He has played well recently, although his owners would still like to see him score on a more consistent basis.

LaDainian Tomlinson <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=213&key=235249&>, RB SD - Bees Updated 11/25/01
Tomlinson was held out of the end zone, but he had a good day against Arizona nonetheless. The rookie tailback had 145 scrimmage yards, including 13 receptions, in San Diego's 20-17 loss. 

Doug Flutie <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=213&key=12375&>, QB SD - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01
Flutie had a solid game, throwing for 308 yards and two touchdowns against Arizona. However, he's only worth starting when the matchup is to his advantage. 

Jake Plummer <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=213&key=1003&>, QB ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01
Plummer had a decent outing on Sunday, posting 241 yards and a touchdown against San Diego. Plummer, who also threw two picks, is only a reserve Fantasy quarterback at best. 

David Boston <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=213&key=133230&>, WR ARI - Dirty Bastards Updated 11/25/01
Boston had another outstanding game, catching six passes for 121 yards and a touchdown against San Diego. H! e'! s one of the most reliable Fantasy receivers in the league, and is worth starting on a weekly basis. 

Willie Jackson <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=213&key=1234&>, WR NO - Anorexic Drunks Updated 11/25/01
Jackson had a good outing against New England, catching five catches for 78 yards and a touchdown. He may not be the most dependable Fantasy receiver, but he is worth starting in deeper leagues. 

Joe Horn <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=213&key=1511&>, WR NO - Clubbers Updated 11/25/01
Horn had another solid outing, catching four passes for 97 yards against New England. He's been a very dependable receiver in recent weeks and is worth starting on a weekly basis.

Tyrone Wheatley <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=213&key=1140&>, RB OAK - Bees Updated 11/25/01
In his return from a knee injury, Wheatley carried the ball five times for 17 yards. Zack Crockett was used more often in short-yardage packages, and Wheatley does not appear capable of starting for any Fantasy team in the near future. Even when he is fully healthy, he may not be able to take many carries away from Charlie Garner.

Antowain Smith <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=213&key=1663&>, RB NE - Baton Rouge Idiot Updated 11/25/01
Smith had 153 yards of total offense and two touchdowns against New Orleans. After a slow start, Smith has become a pretty good weekly option for Fantasy Footballers

Tom Brady <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=213&key=187741&>, QB NE - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01
Brady put up huge numbers against New Orleans, posting 258 yards passing and four touchdowns. He's become a pretty reliable Fantasy player, and his performance will likely keep Drew Bledsoe on the Patriots' bench for another week.

Rich Gannon <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=213&key=1034&>, QB OAK - Mandeville Marriage Updated 11/25/01
Gannon threw for 221 yards, three TDs and no interceptions against the Giants. He ignored rain-soaked conditions, and continued to look like the most reliable QB in Fantasy Football.

Frank Sanders <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=213&key=1184&>, WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01
Sanders left Sunday's game against San Diego after re-aggravating a hamstring injury. He was replaced by MarTay Jenkins, and did not return to the game.

Eric Moulds <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=213&key=1196&>, WR BUF - Clubbers Updated 11/25/01
Moulds finally emerged from an extended slump, catching six passes for 196 yards and two TDs again! st! Miami. He also lost a fumble, and Fantasy owners should still remember that Moulds has been a disappointment for most of the year. Don't be surprised if he follows his best outing of the year with a mediocre performance.

Alex Van Pelt <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=213&key=1011&>, QB BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01
Van Pelt had another fine game, throwing for 309 yards, three TDs and one interception. He is definitely merits strong Fantasy consideration as long as he remains in Buffalo's starting lineup.

Oronde Gadsden <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=213&key=1612&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01
Gadsden caught eight passes for 118 yards at Buffalo. He did not catch a TD pass, though, and lost a fumble. Gadsden is too unreliable to start for most Fantasy teams in these important final weeks.

Jay Fiedler <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=213&key=12363&>, QB MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01
Fiedler threw for 262 yards, three TDs and no interceptions at Buffalo. His performance may have quieted talk of a QB controversy, but Fiedler is still too inconsistent to be a dependable Fantasy QB.

Donovan McNabb <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=213&key=133361&>, QB PHI - Bees Updated 11/25/01
The Redskins held McNabb to 92 passing yards and! 3! 9 rushing yards, with no TDs or interceptions. Expect the Philadelphia QB to rebound quickly from such a quiet performance.

James Thrash <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=213&key=1859&>, WR PHI - Clubbers Updated 11/25/01
Thrash caught four passes for 32 yards against Washington. He is too inconsistent to be a starter on better Fantasy teams as the playoffs approach. 

Rod Gardner <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=213&key=235213&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01
Gardner caught four passes for only 33 yards on Sunday. The rookie has slowed down considerably in the past few weeks, and now seems like a risk during the Fantasy homestret! ch! . 

Ki-Jana Carter <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=213&key=1089&>, RB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01
Carter saw extensive action on Sunday as Stephen Davis played through back problems. He carried 18 times for 56 yards, and is a good backup to have if Davis in on your Fantasy team. Davis has always been known to battle minor injuries.

Isaac Byrd <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=213&key=1762&>, WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01
Byrd started in place of the injured Muhsin Muhammad on Sunday. He posted decent Fantasy numbers in Muhammad's absence, catching five passes for 69 yards in Carolina's 10-7 loss to Atlanta. 

Muhsin Muhammad <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/h! tt! p://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=213&key=1203&>, WR CAR - Manchester United Updated 11/25/01
Muhammad missed Sunday's game against Atlanta due to a shoulder injury. His status for next weekend's game against New Orleans is unknown at this time. 

Derrick Alexander <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=213&key=1191&>, WR KC - Mandeville Marriage Updated 11/25/01
Alexander caught two passes for 56 yards in his return from a rib injury. He was not open often, and Alexander may continue to be a Fantasy disappointment if he stays healthy.

Chris Chandler <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&rand! om! =213&key=1004&>, QB ATL - Anorexic Drunks Updated 11/25/01
Chandler had a subpar game on Sunday, throwing for only 132 yards against Carolina. The Falcons chose to attack Carolina with their ground game, which was the reason for Chandler's poor Fantasy numbers. 

Derrick Alexander <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=213&key=1191&>, WR KC - Mandeville Marriage Updated 11/25/01
Alexander caught two passes for 56 yards in his return from a rib injury. He was not open often, and Alexander may continue to be a Fantasy disappointment if he stays healthy.

Volume Management should be fine with this change. All name changes will be 
still attached to the original path of the Buy/Sell deal. The Settlement 
Group will have to make sure that the new name that is being added to the 
deal has the appropriate 'Statement Group' attached.  Other than that this 
change should flow smoothly.

Thanks,

Subject: Re: Sitara Release (Re: Changes in Global due to Consent to 
Assignment)  

FYI....

This change went in for the Deal Validation group.   It gives them the 
ability to change counterparties names after bridge back.

Impact to Logistics - Unify
If a counterparty name change takes place to deals that have been bridge 
backed, it could cause problems on EDI pipes as that new counterparty name 
will flow over to Unify and repathing should eventually take place.
One problem may be with the Imbalance data sets, which are not in production 
yet......(EDI Imbalance Qtys would not match up to paths)
This may also cause an issue with the scheduled quantities (especially where 
nominations were sent for entire month)
can't remember the rules on this one, but I think Unify does have some safe 
guards (idiot proofs) to force re-pathing.
Unify does have the ability to over-ride duns numbers, yet would still cause 
an additional step for EDI the scheduler would need to think through in order 
to get a clean quick response.
What are (if any) impacts to Vol Mgt if counterparty name changes take 
place?  (prior periods?  re-pathing?)

I have a call into Diane and Dave both.  After speaking w/ them, hopefully I 
can get a clear understanding of the true impact.  I am sure we'll need to 
put some processes and procedures together for Deal Validation to follow when 
these type of changes are needed.

Will keep you posted.

Thanks,

dg

Subject: Sitara Release (Re: Changes in Global due to Consent to Assignment)


Regarding the ability to change counterparties on deals in SITARA with 
confirmed volumes - Tom's words of caution:

If someone calls you and wants to change a counterparty - we created the 
ability for you to invalidate the deal - and 
then change the counterparty - however - I did add a warning message:

"Warning - changing counterparty on deal with confirmed volumes - make sure 
pipeline allows this change."   

Some pipelines do not allow us to change counterparties after there is 
feedback - I assume for the same reasons
we had this rule - it used to blow up our old scheduling systems 
(pre-UNIFY).  Some pipelines will require a new 
deal and we will have to zero out the old deal.

Before you make the change - make sure the logistics person is aware - just 
in case it causes problems with their
pipeline.   Sorry - I don't know which pipes these are - you will have to ask 
the UNIFY team.

There is one rule still in place - you can change from ENA-IM East to ENA-IM 
Market East - but not from 
ENA-IM Texas to HPLC-IM HPLC - when changing business units - they must be 
the same legal entity. 
"Warning - not the same legal entity"

Also - beware of making contract and counterparty changes to Service deals 
(Transport Capacity, Storage, Cash Out).
Once the deal is invalidated - there are no rules.  Don't forget - the items 
were locked down for a reason.
 If you invalidate a service deal - and change the previously locked down 
data that was validated - and someone used these
deals in UNIFY - it is highly likely that the UNIFY deals and paths created 
using these deals will get corrupted.  Always check 
with someone from UNIFY to make sure no one used these deals for anything in 
UNIFY.

Subject: Sitara Release (Re: Changes in Global due to Consent to Assignment)  

With the release that was put out Tuesday evening, Deal Validation should be 
able to change the counterparty on deals where the volume is something other 
than expected (e.g. confirmed, nominated, scheduled, etc.).  

In addition, this release will also capture "near-time" the contract changes 
that are made in global.  This means that need for server bounces will not be 
necessary.

 New/Changes to contracts will show up without having to get out of deal 
manager.
 New Counterparties, and new/changes to facilities will require getting out 
of all active Sitara apps (except for launch pad).  
  Once out of all apps, start a new app - the respective information that you 
are looking for will appear.

I mention "near-time" because we are constrained by the amount of time it 
takes for the change in Global data to trigger an alert for Sitara who then 
updates its information

Subject: Re: Sitara Release (Re: Changes in Global due to Consent to 
Assignment)  

FYI....

This change went in for the Deal Validation group.   It gives them the 
ability to change counterparties names after bridge back.

Impact to Logistics - Unify
If a counterparty name change takes place to deals that have been bridge 
backed, it could cause problems on EDI pipes as that new counterparty name 
will flow over to Unify and repathing should eventually take place.
One problem may be with the Imbalance data sets, which are not in production 
yet......(EDI Imbalance Qtys would not match up to paths)
This may also cause an issue with the scheduled quantities (especially where 
nominations were sent for entire month)
can't remember the rules on this one, but I think Unify does have some safe 
guards (idiot proofs) to force re-pathing.
Unify does have the ability to over-ride duns numbers, yet would still cause 
an additional step for EDI the scheduler would need to think through in order 
to get a clean quick response.
What are (if any) impacts to Vol Mgt if counterparty name changes take 
place?  (prior periods?  re-pathing?)

I have a call into Diane and Dave both.  After speaking w/ them, hopefully I 
can get a clear understanding of the true impact.  I am sure we'll need to 
put some processes and procedures together for Deal Validation to follow when 
these type of changes are needed.

Will keep you posted.

Thanks,

dg

Subject: Sitara Release (Re: Changes in Global due to Consent to Assignment)


Regarding the ability to change counterparties on deals in SITARA with 
confirmed volumes - Tom's words of caution:

If someone calls you and wants to change a counterparty - we created the 
ability for you to invalidate the deal - and 
then change the counterparty - however - I did add a warning message:

"Warning - changing counterparty on deal with confirmed volumes - make sure 
pipeline allows this change."   

Some pipelines do not allow us to change counterparties after there is 
feedback - I assume for the same reasons
we had this rule - it used to blow up our old scheduling systems 
(pre-UNIFY).  Some pipelines will require a new 
deal and we will have to zero out the old deal.

Before you make the change - make sure the logistics person is aware - just 
in case it causes problems with their
pipeline.   Sorry - I don't know which pipes these are - you will have to ask 
the UNIFY team.

There is one rule still in place - you can change from ENA-IM East to ENA-IM 
Market East - but not from 
ENA-IM Texas to HPLC-IM HPLC - when changing business units - they must be 
the same legal entity. 
"Warning - not the same legal entity"

Also - beware of making contract and counterparty changes to Service deals 
(Transport Capacity, Storage, Cash Out).
Once the deal is invalidated - there are no rules.  Don't forget - the items 
were locked down for a reason.
 If you invalidate a service deal - and change the previously locked down 
data that was validated - and someone used these
deals in UNIFY - it is highly likely that the UNIFY deals and paths created 
using these deals will get corrupted.  Always check 
with someone from UNIFY to make sure no one used these deals for anything in 
UNIFY.

Subject: Sitara Release (Re: Changes in Global due to Consent to Assignment)  

With the release that was put out Tuesday evening, Deal Validation should be 
able to change the counterparty on deals where the volume is something other 
than expected (e.g. confirmed, nominated, scheduled, etc.).  

In addition, this release will also capture "near-time" the contract changes 
that are made in global.  This means that need for server bounces will not be 
necessary.

 New/Changes to contracts will show up without having to get out of deal 
manager.
 New Counterparties, and new/changes to facilities will require getting out 
of all active Sitara apps (except for launch pad).  
  Once out of all apps, start a new app - the respective information that you 
are looking for will appear.

I mention "near-time" because we are constrained by the amount of time it 
takes for the change in Global data to trigger an alert for Sitara who then 
updates its information

THE WEEK/Let The Bells Have It

"The lack of cheap, always-on, last-mile broadband connections to small
offices and homes is a short leash around the U.S. economy's neck. Yes,
taxes are too high, especially those on capital formation. We hope
Congress will figure out what every businessman knows: This recession is
investment-led. And yes, the Fed should drop its funds rate to 3%. And
yes, there is huge inventory overhang everywhere you look in IT. If all
that isn't enough to give you a bad hair day, ponder the telco debt bomb
that threatens to blow up Wall Street.

"The dot-com boom started in 1995 and went bust in 2000. Every dolt
imagined he was a venture investor. There was overfunding galore, idiot
businesses up the gazoo--and then pfft. Net Boom, Act II awaits. It will
occur when a catalyst technology changes everything, just as the 386 chip
and graphics transformed PCs. What the Net awaits is obvious: cheap
broadband (enough for streaming video) and always-on connections.

"Already I can hear skeptics howling that bandwidth demand is not a sure
thing, that the dogs will never eat it. But who can forecast demand
without the supply that fires the imagination and stirs entrepreneurs to
create radically new uses, not just extensions? Who in 1984 ever guessed
that most CEOs would use e-mail by 1998? Who in 1989 imagined the
necessity of Web-based supply-side chains, let alone the Web? How accurate
is it ever to gauge, say, traffic for a proposed bridge by counting ferry
boats and swimmers? Forget last-mile as you know it today: clunky DSL or
cable modem service. These are mere swimmers and ferry boats. The bridge
will come when last-mile connections are easy to order (one phone call or
Web click); quick to deliver (the very next day); always on (like
electricity in, uh, 49 states); and cheap ($20 a month or less). When the
dogs are served that, they'll eat till they burst."

Nobody makes the bandwidth case better than our great friend and tireless
Silicon Valley watcher Rich Karlgaard. Read the full text of "Let The
Bells Have It" at

BIOTECH WATCH: Old Stem Cells Do It Better

"All systems were go for federally funded embryo stem-cell research at the
National Institutes of Health. New guidelines bequeathed by the Clinton
administration for skirting a congressional ban were in place. A meeting
to review the first applications for grants was set for mid-April, when
NIH's acting director Ruth Kirschstein suddenly received the word from on
high: cancel the meeting. Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy G.
Thompson wanted a chance to review the new guidelines. Some NIH
researchers were aghast.

"What's all the fuss about? Stem cells represent a mother lode of possible
new treatments for diabetes, heart disease, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and
more. Capable of differentiating into the full spectrum of other cell
types--from a new liver cell to a new neuron--they could be ideal for
repairing or replacing diseased organs. The furor is not over their
usefulness, but their source: Should researchers use aborted or discarded
human embryos? Or should they be restricted to adult stem-cells, found in
fat, bone, and the brain?

"Those ethical questions are riveting, but they are being trumped by the
market, specifically the venture investment market, which is voting with
its dollars for adult stem-cell research. The universe of established
companies doing stem-cell research encompasses about 30 public and private
biotechnology firms. Of these, fewer than half are involved primarily in
developing treatments from stem cells. And only two of those 15 pure-play
companies do significant work with embryonic cells."

Dr Scott Gottlieb, Gilder's newest analyst, dives into the stem-cell
debate in June's issue of The American Spectator. Read the full text at

FRIDAY BONUS/Gelernter Live

Venerable Peter Drucker argues that the greatest profits go to whoever
supplies the key missing element in a technology, igniting new spirals of
advance. Think Windows or CDMA and you have the idea.

With an elegant software application called Scopeware, Yale's prodigal
David Gelernter could hold a similar key to unlocking the pent-up power
stemming from the intersection of big bandwidth and data storage--what we
call the storewidth paradigm. At our Storewidth 2001 conference in Laguna
Niguel in April, edited excerpts from a videotaped interview we did with
Gelernter in New Haven earlier this year riveted the house. Now we're
making the full two-hour conversation available for the first time. Tune
in now, at www.gilder.com.

Volume Management should be fine with this change. All name changes will be 
still attached to the original path of the Buy/Sell deal. The Settlement 
Group will have to make sure that the new name that is being added to the 
deal has the appropriate 'Statement Group' attached.  Other than that this 
change should flow smoothly.

Thanks,

Subject: Re: Sitara Release (Re: Changes in Global due to Consent to 
Assignment)  

FYI....

This change went in for the Deal Validation group.   It gives them the 
ability to change counterparties names after bridge back.

Impact to Logistics - Unify
If a counterparty name change takes place to deals that have been bridge 
backed, it could cause problems on EDI pipes as that new counterparty name 
will flow over to Unify and repathing should eventually take place.
One problem may be with the Imbalance data sets, which are not in production 
yet......(EDI Imbalance Qtys would not match up to paths)
This may also cause an issue with the scheduled quantities (especially where 
nominations were sent for entire month)
can't remember the rules on this one, but I think Unify does have some safe 
guards (idiot proofs) to force re-pathing.
Unify does have the ability to over-ride duns numbers, yet would still cause 
an additional step for EDI the scheduler would need to think through in order 
to get a clean quick response.
What are (if any) impacts to Vol Mgt if counterparty name changes take 
place?  (prior periods?  re-pathing?)

I have a call into Diane and Dave both.  After speaking w/ them, hopefully I 
can get a clear understanding of the true impact.  I am sure we'll need to 
put some processes and procedures together for Deal Validation to follow when 
these type of changes are needed.

Will keep you posted.

Thanks,

dg

Subject: Sitara Release (Re: Changes in Global due to Consent to Assignment)


Regarding the ability to change counterparties on deals in SITARA with 
confirmed volumes - Tom's words of caution:

If someone calls you and wants to change a counterparty - we created the 
ability for you to invalidate the deal - and 
then change the counterparty - however - I did add a warning message:

"Warning - changing counterparty on deal with confirmed volumes - make sure 
pipeline allows this change."   

Some pipelines do not allow us to change counterparties after there is 
feedback - I assume for the same reasons
we had this rule - it used to blow up our old scheduling systems 
(pre-UNIFY).  Some pipelines will require a new 
deal and we will have to zero out the old deal.

Before you make the change - make sure the logistics person is aware - just 
in case it causes problems with their
pipeline.   Sorry - I don't know which pipes these are - you will have to ask 
the UNIFY team.

There is one rule still in place - you can change from ENA-IM East to ENA-IM 
Market East - but not from 
ENA-IM Texas to HPLC-IM HPLC - when changing business units - they must be 
the same legal entity. 
"Warning - not the same legal entity"

Also - beware of making contract and counterparty changes to Service deals 
(Transport Capacity, Storage, Cash Out).
Once the deal is invalidated - there are no rules.  Don't forget - the items 
were locked down for a reason.
 If you invalidate a service deal - and change the previously locked down 
data that was validated - and someone used these
deals in UNIFY - it is highly likely that the UNIFY deals and paths created 
using these deals will get corrupted.  Always check 
with someone from UNIFY to make sure no one used these deals for anything in 
UNIFY.

Subject: Sitara Release (Re: Changes in Global due to Consent to Assignment)  

With the release that was put out Tuesday evening, Deal Validation should be 
able to change the counterparty on deals where the volume is something other 
than expected (e.g. confirmed, nominated, scheduled, etc.).  

In addition, this release will also capture "near-time" the contract changes 
that are made in global.  This means that need for server bounces will not be 
necessary.

 New/Changes to contracts will show up without having to get out of deal 
manager.
 New Counterparties, and new/changes to facilities will require getting out 
of all active Sitara apps (except for launch pad).  
  Once out of all apps, start a new app - the respective information that you 
are looking for will appear.

I mention "near-time" because we are constrained by the amount of time it 
takes for the change in Global data to trigger an alert for Sitara who then 
updates its information

to any downstream processes.  

I hope the following will give more clarification.   

Let me know if you have any questions or need more detail! 

Thanks,
dg  3-9517


Sitara / Unify - Process
* Scenario - Counterparty name changes on Sitara deal ticket after deal had 
been pathed, scheduled & bridged back from Unify.
* Impact - zero impact to Logistics & Volume Management, absolutely 
harmless.  Settlements has process in place to eliminate issues.
* Process - 
Counterparty A in Sitara changes to Counterparty B.   
Ctprty A was on original path sent to pipeline.  
The new name (ctprty B) does bridge over to Unify.
Ctprty A remains at the path level in Unify (gui display does not change)
Ctprty B is now displayed at the deal level in Unify.  The field is now 
highlighted to indicate a change occurred. (gui display changes only at high 
level, not on path)
The Scheduler has choice to repath (if necessary), or not re-path
If re-pathing occurs, the new counterparty name will be displaced on new path

Unify pushes back the deal number & meter to Sitara (not ctprty info)
Balancing works on deal number & meter only (not ctprty info)
The confirmation desk utilizes the information in Sitara (where all 
information is correct)
Volume Management utilizes the information in Unify for pipeline tie-out.  
(all information sent to pipeline is correct at the path level and will match 
up perfectly)
Settlements utilizes information in Unify.  
Settlements recognizes that changed ctprty names changes contracts, which 
would create two notification entries
If invoice did happen to go out to wrong ctprty, re-draft would occur.
(note:  there was an issues discovered on reports which IT is correcting now)


Autonoms "Tom's words of warning" - 
Previously there was an issue when counterparty name changes took place after 
deals were pathed and nominated.  Basically it would change a key on an EDI 
path (duns number) not affecting any other of the information already 
nominated to the pipeline.  If the scheduler re-nominated, data at the 
pipeline would get doubled up and the scheduler would have NO way to correct 
the problem.  In most cases, the schedulers would have to get the pipeline to 
manually cut the original nominated volume.  This is not an issue with Unify 
(as explained above).


(Dave - feel free to chime in if I left anything out.)

Subject: Re: Sitara Release (Re: Changes in Global due to Consent to

FYI....

This change went in for the Deal Validation group.   It gives them the 
ability to change counterparties names after bridge back.

Impact to Logistics - Unify
If a counterparty name change takes place to deals that have been bridge 
backed, it could cause problems on EDI pipes as that new counterparty name 
will flow over to Unify and repathing should eventually take place.
One problem may be with the Imbalance data sets, which are not in production 
yet......(EDI Imbalance Qtys would not match up to paths)
This may also cause an issue with the scheduled quantities (especially where 
nominations were sent for entire month)
can't remember the rules on this one, but I think Unify does have some safe 
guards (idiot proofs) to force re-pathing.
Unify does have the ability to over-ride duns numbers, yet would still cause 
an additional step for EDI the scheduler would need to think through in order 
to get a clean quick response.
What are (if any) impacts to Vol Mgt if counterparty name changes take 
place?  (prior periods?  re-pathing?)

I have a call into Diane and Dave both.  After speaking w/ them, hopefully I 
can get a clear understanding of the true impact.  I am sure we'll need to 
put some processes and procedures together for Deal Validation to follow when 
these type of changes are needed.

Will keep you posted.

Thanks,

dg

Subject: Sitara Release (Re: Changes in Global due to Consent to Assignment)


Regarding the ability to change counterparties on deals in SITARA with 
confirmed volumes - Tom's words of caution:

If someone calls you and wants to change a counterparty - we created the 
ability for you to invalidate the deal - and 
then change the counterparty - however - I did add a warning message:

"Warning - changing counterparty on deal with confirmed volumes - make sure 
pipeline allows this change."   

Some pipelines do not allow us to change counterparties after there is 
feedback - I assume for the same reasons
we had this rule - it used to blow up our old scheduling systems 
(pre-UNIFY).  Some pipelines will require a new 
deal and we will have to zero out the old deal.

Before you make the change - make sure the logistics person is aware - just 
in case it causes problems with their
pipeline.   Sorry - I don't know which pipes these are - you will have to ask 
the UNIFY team.

There is one rule still in place - you can change from ENA-IM East to ENA-IM 
Market East - but not from 
ENA-IM Texas to HPLC-IM HPLC - when changing business units - they must be 
the same legal entity. 
"Warning - not the same legal entity"

Also - beware of making contract and counterparty changes to Service deals 
(Transport Capacity, Storage, Cash Out).
Once the deal is invalidated - there are no rules.  Don't forget - the items 
were locked down for a reason.
 If you invalidate a service deal - and change the previously locked down 
data that was validated - and someone used these
deals in UNIFY - it is highly likely that the UNIFY deals and paths created 
using these deals will get corrupted.  Always check 
with someone from UNIFY to make sure no one used these deals for anything in 
UNIFY.

Subject: Sitara Release (Re: Changes in Global due to Consent to Assignment)  

With the release that was put out Tuesday evening, Deal Validation should be 
able to change the counterparty on deals where the volume is something other 
than expected (e.g. confirmed, nominated, scheduled, etc.).  

In addition, this release will also capture "near-time" the contract changes 
that are made in global.  This means that need for server bounces will not be 
necessary.

 New/Changes to contracts will show up without having to get out of deal 
manager.
 New Counterparties, and new/changes to facilities will require getting out 
of all active Sitara apps (except for launch pad).  
  Once out of all apps, start a new app - the respective information that you 
are looking for will appear.

I mention "near-time" because we are constrained by the amount of time it 
takes for the change in Global data to trigger an alert for Sitara who then 
updates its information

Dilbert Newsletter 38.0
-----------------------


To:     Dogbert's New Ruling Class (DNRC)
From:   Scott Adams (scottadams@aol.com)
Date:   November 2001



Highlights
-------------------------------------------------
* Scott's Patriotic Duty
* Boss and Cow-orker Quotes
* Holiday Gift Ideas
* True Tales of Induhviduals
-------------------------------------------------


DNRC Update
-----------

There are 400,000 people in the DNRC, each more attractive,
generous and intelligent than those who do not read the free
Dilbert Newsletter. Maybe that's a coincidence, but I'm starting to
doubt it.

My Patriotic Duty
-----------------

I've been wondering about the best way to offer my patriotic
services in this time of global conflict. I don't think I'd be a
good candidate for Special Ops. I'd be the
one with the wheeled carry-on bag saying, "Hey, guys, I have sand
in my shoe! Is anyone else hungry? Can I use my flashlight now?"

I'm already donating money to patriotic causes, and I bought some
plastic flags made in China, but I felt I needed to do more. Then
it hit me. There is one patriotic duty for which I have prepared my
entire life: dehumanizing the enemy. In a sense, that's been my
full-time job for years. I just need to replace the word
"management" with "Taliban." So let's get started.

I've been trying to figure out the Taliban's long-term strategy and
I think I got it: They're trying to reverse evolution. Their
uncontrolled body hair is a good start. Living in caves was an
obvious step too.

The hard part was eliminating any trace of intelligence in the
children. But they've made great strides in that area. Have you
seen the video of the Taliban schools where the little kids squat
on the floor and rock back and forth chanting all day? No math, no
social studies, just rocking and chanting. For PE they use sticks
to whack stuffed dummies labeled "Bush" and "Blair." I'm not sure
how they know how to spell "Bush" and "Blair." On any given morning
they're probably whacking dummies labeled "Tqwft" and "Upxpgt" but
it's a good aerobic workout either way.

Just for fun, ask yourself what part of the Taliban curriculum
could NOT be accomplished by, for example, a monkey: Rocking back
and forth? Chanting? Beating a dummy with a stick? Even if a monkey
only got a "D" in chanting, he would still graduate with honors
from a Taliban school thanks to his high overall grades in rocking
and whacking.

As I write this, our generals are trying to figure out how to get
the Taliban out of their caves. They're running sophisticated war
game scenarios and calculating risks and gathering intelligence. I
have one word for them:

                       bananas

I don't want my patriotic words misconstrued as ethnic or religious
insults. As soon as the evildoers stop doing evil, I am willing to
promote them to full-fledged Induhviduals and insult them on equal
footing with everyone else who doesn't read the Dilbert Newsletter.

Now that we've dehumanized the Taliban, let's get on to the
important work of dehumanizing our bosses, cow-orkers and family
members.


Induhvidual Confusion
---------------------

Some topics seem to confuse Induhviduals more than others. For
example, they seem to have special trouble with concepts involving
wildlife, vision and their own pants. See for yourself in these
true quotes from Induhvidual bosses and Cow-orkers, submitted by
DNRC members:

---

A VP was speaking at a meeting and said, "Well, you can lead a
horse to water but you can't make him crap." Someone up front said,
"That's drink...can't make him drink."  To which the VP said,
"That's stupid."

---

"In the kingdom of the blind, the one-eyed horse is king!"

---

A cow-orker once said, "Looks like he's thrown a wrench in the
monkeyworks."

---

"A two-prawn approach is necessary."

---

Here is a mangled expression the CIO at our company told me the
other day. We were discussing an issue we both agreed upon and he
said I was "preaching to the blind."

---

"He won't last, he's just a flash in the pants."

---

One of the employees called in to say that she couldn't come to
work because she "...had to have an autopsy."

---

My boss was telling a very involved story about something that
happened to him. He leaned back nonchalantly and offered as a
philosophical summary: "Sometimes fact is stranger than truth."

---

"It's a catch 20-20."

---

Our former boss suffered from the excessive use of mixed metaphors.
An all-time howler was the day we asked him what his plans were to
ensure success for a campaign and his reply was "Don't worry; I've
got an ace up my hole."

---

At a management meeting, my CEO said, "Our company is like a living
orgasm." Now that's what I call job satisfaction.

---

I overheard a manager congratulating an Induhvidual on having
achieved a goal. The Induhvidual replied, "It was nothing. You
planted the seed, and I ran with it."

---
In a meeting a cow-orker of mine referred to "the carrot at the end
of the tunnel."

---

"We are going to be shooting from the seat of our pants on this
one."

---

These all came from the same boss:

"Vision is in the eyes of the beholder."

"Part of the verbiage is a language thing."

"Eventually, I want it now."

"It's not that kind of zero."

"There are a lot of areas for efficiency reductions."

"In the last year, you've turned around 150%."

---

When a high-powered agent of the company walked into the lunch
room, our secretary remarked to our group that she couldn't stand
him because he was "so ego-testicle."  One of my cow-orkers spit
coffee out of his nose, which just added to the moment.

---

"I think you might have hit the nail on the button."

---

"...caught between a rock and a wet spot."

---

And my nomination for scariest thing a boss ever said:

"I was thinking about you in the shower this morning and I thought
of a name for you."

Holiday Gift Ideas
------------------

When I'm not slaving away writing FREE Dilbert Newsletters for you,
I sometimes make holiday gift recommendations. I believe a gift
should acknowledge the recipient's unique personality and
interests. That's why I organized these suggestions by personality
defect.


For Heathens, Vulcans, Skeptics and Dogmatics:
----------------------------------------------

My first non-Dilbert book, "God's Debris" (now in hardcover), is
full of thought experiments about souls, free will and science that
will have your friends and family arguing with each other for
weeks. Combine the book with alcoholic beverages and there might
even be some slapping.

The book is designed to fit in a stocking and to look as if you put
more thought into the gift than you really did. Imagine how smart
you'll seem when you say, "I found all the errors in reasoning. I'm
sure you will too."

We probably didn't print enough copies of "God's Debris" for the
holiday season (really) - it's way more popular than I expected --
so if it's meant to be a gift, act now. Get several for your smart
friends or get just one and let people borrow it.

You can find "God's Debris" at:

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0740721909/unitedmedia/107-5126509-7932516


People With Short Attention Spans:
----------------------------------

I recommend the Dilbert Page-A-Day Calendar for people who can't
handle more than 10 seconds per day of any one type of
entertainment. For more severe cases of attention deficit, consider
the monthly wall calendar or the weekly planner.

Imagine the look on the face of the lucky recipient, full of
unmitigated joy and boundless appreciation for your gift-giving
brilliance.

You can find these calendars at the following links:

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0740715674/ref=ase_unitedmedia/104-2285776-7245555

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0740715712/ref=ase_unitedmedia/104-2285776-7245555

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0740715690/ref=ase_unitedmedia/104-2285776-7245555


People Who Are Hard To Shop For:
--------------------------------

I recommend my new book, "When Did Ignorance Become a Point of
View?" It's a compilation of Dilbert comics that won't clash with
anyone's home decorations or wardrobe. And it shows thoughtfulness
because everyone you know has either had a job or knows someone who
has.

Tip: When it's being unwrapped say, "You'll like this unless you're
dead inside." That prevents most people from complaining, which is
similar to being happy.

This book is available at:

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0740718398/ref=ase_unitedmedia/104-2285776-7245555


For Dyslexics:
--------------

For dyslexics (like me) I recommend the or Calendar Day-A-Page
Dilbert, my book "Debris God's," my and book, "When Become Did a
Point of Ignorance View."

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0740715674/ref=ase_unitedmedia/104-2285776-7245555

http://www.dilbert.com/comics/dilbert/shop/


People Who Stand Too Close:
---------------------------

Dilbert mints, featuring Manage-Mints, Improve-Mints,
Accomplish-mints and Pay-mints are now available at:

http://www.candy2you.com/store/merchant.mv?Screen=CTGY&Store_Code=CS&Category_Code=D&Affiliate=Dilbert.

The mints are good for people who like tasty mints or bad puns or
collecting little tin containers for who-knows-what purpose.


Plop, The Hairless Elbonian
---------------------------

Over the summer I was experimenting with a Dilbert spin-off comic
strip about a little boy and his pig growing up in the clueless
country of Elbonia. Unfortunately this isn't a good time to launch
a comic featuring people who look like the Taliban. So it's on the
shelf, probably permanently.

You can see the experimental strips at:

http://www.unitedmedia.com/comics/plop/

Let me know what you think.



True Tales of Induhviduals
--------------------------

Here now, more true tales of Induhviduals, as submitted by members
of the DNRC.

The story in your last newsletter about the kid named Ampersand
reminded me of another version I heard recently.  One of my
relatives met a woman who wanted to call her kid LATRINE.  It took
me an hour to stop laughing long enough to ask if anybody had
pointed out what a latrine is.  They had. She was apparently still
intent on using it.

---

When I received my new credit card, it had the number two (2) after
my name instead of Roman numeral II as it should have, indicating
that my name is the same as my father's.  I called the bank's
customer service number and asked that their records be changed to
use the Roman numeral two (II) instead of the number two (2).

The customer service rep said, "I'm sorry, sir.  My computer
doesn't have Roman numerals."

---

I just went to see the Cirque du Soleil. During one performance,
where a man and woman were flying around by having scarves under
their arms attached to this huge wheel thing in the air while doing
complicated acrobatics at the same time, an Induhvidual behind me
said to her companion, "That must take a lot of practice."

---

At my bookstore a customer returned three of Shakespeare's books
because, "The DARN things are in the form of PLAYS!"

---

At the grocery store, the checkout woman scanned all of my items
then picked up the rubber divider and looked it over for the bar
code so she could scan it.  She asked, "Do you know how much this
is?"

I said, "I've changed my mind, I don't think I'll buy that today."

She said, "Okay." I paid her and left.


Dilbert Fodder
---------------

What's bugging you about your job?  Let me know and you might see
it in a Dilbert comic or newsletter.  The best comic fodder
involves workplace peeves, devious strategies, frustrations of
dealing with others, conflicting objectives, unintended management
consequences, and of course my favorite - idiot bosses.

And I love True Tales of Induhviduals.

And if you're seeing any new management trends that need to be
mocked, I can help.  Send your suggestions to me at
scottadams@aol.com.  Short ones are better.

People Who Are Hard To Shop For:
--------------------------------

I recommend my new book, "When Did Ignorance Become a Point of
View?" It's a compilation of Dilbert comics that won't clash with
anyone's home decorations or wardrobe. And it shows thoughtfulness
because everyone you know has either had a job or knows someone who
has.

Tip: When it's being unwrapped say, "You'll like this unless you're
dead inside." That prevents most people from complaining, which is
similar to being happy.

This book is available at:

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0740718398/ref=ase_unitedmedia/104-2285776-7245555


For Dyslexics:
--------------

For dyslexics (like me) I recommend the or Calendar Day-A-Page
Dilbert, my book "Debris God's," my and book, "When Become Did a
Point of Ignorance View."

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0740715674/ref=ase_unitedmedia/104-2285776-7245555

http://www.dilbert.com/comics/dilbert/shop/


People Who Stand Too Close:
---------------------------

Dilbert mints, featuring Manage-Mints, Improve-Mints,
Accomplish-mints and Pay-mints are now available at:

http://www.candy2you.com/store/merchant.mv?Screen=CTGY&Store_Code=CS&Category_Code=D&Affiliate=Dilbert.

The mints are good for people who like tasty mints or bad puns or
collecting little tin containers for who-knows-what purpose.


Plop, The Hairless Elbonian
---------------------------

Over the summer I was experimenting with a Dilbert spin-off comic
strip about a little boy and his pig growing up in the clueless
country of Elbonia. Unfortunately this isn't a good time to launch
a comic featuring people who look like the Taliban. So it's on the
shelf, probably permanently.

You can see the experimental strips at:

http://www.unitedmedia.com/comics/plop/

Let me know what you think.



True Tales of Induhviduals
--------------------------

Here now, more true tales of Induhviduals, as submitted by members
of the DNRC.

The story in your last newsletter about the kid named Ampersand
reminded me of another version I heard recently.  One of my
relatives met a woman who wanted to call her kid LATRINE.  It took
me an hour to stop laughing long enough to ask if anybody had
pointed out what a latrine is.  They had. She was apparently still
intent on using it.

---

When I received my new credit card, it had the number two (2) after
my name instead of Roman numeral II as it should have, indicating
that my name is the same as my father's.  I called the bank's
customer service number and asked that their records be changed to
use the Roman numeral two (II) instead of the number two (2).

The customer service rep said, "I'm sorry, sir.  My computer
doesn't have Roman numerals."

---

I just went to see the Cirque du Soleil. During one performance,
where a man and woman were flying around by having scarves under
their arms attached to this huge wheel thing in the air while doing
complicated acrobatics at the same time, an Induhvidual behind me
said to her companion, "That must take a lot of practice."

---

At my bookstore a customer returned three of Shakespeare's books
because, "The DARN things are in the form of PLAYS!"

---

At the grocery store, the checkout woman scanned all of my items
then picked up the rubber divider and looked it over for the bar
code so she could scan it.  She asked, "Do you know how much this
is?"

I said, "I've changed my mind, I don't think I'll buy that today."

She said, "Okay." I paid her and left.


Dilbert Fodder
---------------

What's bugging you about your job?  Let me know and you might see
it in a Dilbert comic or newsletter.  The best comic fodder
involves workplace peeves, devious strategies, frustrations of
dealing with others, conflicting objectives, unintended management
consequences, and of course my favorite - idiot bosses.

And I love True Tales of Induhviduals.

And if you're seeing any new management trends that need to be
mocked, I can help.  Send your suggestions to me at
scottadams@aol.com.  Short ones are better.

DNRC Update
-----------

The DNRC is 300,000 people strong, which is ironic if you consider
that few of us can lift heavy objects.  Luckily we have the
non-DNRC people, the so-called In-duh-viduals, to do our manual
labor.  After Dogbert conquers the planet and makes the
Induhviduals our personal servants, there will be no more fussing
with parallel parking.  A small team of Induhviduals will be
stationed at every potential parking place, ready to lift your
vehicle and gently place it near the curb.  A second team will
swoop in and tongue-clean your bumper to remove the fingerprints
left by the first team.  A third team will swoop in and take your
vehicle to the landfill so you don't have to drive a car that's
been slobbered on.  I realize this sounds inefficient, but remember
there are over six billion Induhviduals.  It's important to keep
them busy.

Speaking of keeping busy...


My Trip to New York City
---------------------------------

I am writing this trip report while in New York City to do some PR
for my new web site feature (The Lazy Entrepreneur at Dilbert.com).
Because I am a famous cartoonist I am staying in a new hotel that
costs $500 per night.  That might impress those of you who live in
huts made entirely of manure.  But if you are familiar with NYC you
are probably blowing coffee out your nose and slapping your donut
flat in a fit of spastic laughter because you know what $500 buys
in the Big Apple.  Herein, I offer my description of the luxurious
NYC hotel experience.

I'm struck by the similarity between my situation and John Gotti's.
We have similar careers: He's a convicted mob boss; I'm a
cartoonist.  But here the similarity ends, because his current
living conditions are far more luxurious.

My room is ever-so-slightly wider than the bed.  If it were
possible to make a room smaller than its bed, I would be in that
room.  I'm sure the hotel has hired a team of physicists to crack
that nut.

The television's remote control doesn't work, but that doesn't
matter because you can reach the TV with your hand from almost any
location in the room.

The "closet" consists of a ten-inch metal pipe that sticks out from
the wall, suitable for hanging upwards of three garments.  Directly
below the metal pipe is a safe for your valuables. This leaves
plenty of space for your clothes, assuming you wear the same pants
size as G.I. Joe.

My heating/cooling system produces an inexplicable noise every five
minutes.  The noise sounds like a combination of a squeaky door
opening and a sword being drawn from its scabbard.  This is exactly
the sort of noise you want to hear when you're trying to sleep in
New York City.

The shower has a playful feature.  The only way you can get to the
shower controls is by reaching around a barrier and placing your
head directly under the showerhead.  There's nothing like a snoot
full of cold water to get your day started.

As you probably know, New York City taxi drivers originate from
many different countries.  They compensate for their incomplete
grasp of English by facing away from the passenger and mumbling.  I
learned to interpret their mumbles by the context.  For example, a
mumble when you get in the car means, "You look handsome today.  To
what destination may I transport you?"  A mumble while slowing down
and looking out a side window means, "This is your destination.
Have a wonderful day.  Thank you so much for the business."  If you
argue that he is driving in the wrong direction he will shrug.  The
shrug means, "Your concern is unwarranted.  I have a secret way of
going to places by driving in the wrong direction."  Using this
system of translation I have mastered over 100 different dialects.

Buying Gifts for Women
----------------------

Most men are not good at buying gifts for women.  That's why I put
together a tutorial on gift-buying that you can see at the Lycos
Video Center:

True Tales of Induhviduals
--------------------------

Here are some more True Tales of Induhviduals as reported by
vigilant DNRC members.


True Tale 1
------------

A friend of mine manages a Barnes and Noble store.  One of her high
school part-time workers called in to say she was unable to come to
work.  Her excuse was that she couldn't find her bra.

True Tale 2
------------

A group of employees were eating together before a conference.  The
big boss lambasted everyone at the table for his or her role (or
their home state's role) in screwing up the recent election.  His
rant was complete with colorful, blasphemous, scatological and
anatomically impossible metaphors. All this was done with his mouth
full, and capped by a loud belch.  Then his number two, a Senior
VP, topped him in one stroke, by scratching his (own) back with a
table fork.

It is leadership to inspire the soul.

True Tale 3
-----------

Update:  We've recently recorded our 500th quote from my boss...

"I didn't fall off the horse yesterday."

True Tale 4
-----------

My new officemate comes into my office with three chairs.  One is
particularly nice.  Apparently it was stolen from the conference
room.  His comment, "I asked the other guy taking a chair and he
didn't care."


True Tale 5
-----------

I work with an engineer who makes his own cologne. He has several
scents, the worst of which are lemon cough drops and smoky sweet
patchouli.  Pregnant women and people with sensitive noses are
unable to work with him.  Recently he revealed that he has been
experimenting with pheromones and found that he got "quite a
reaction" from women in bars.  That reaction doesn't seem to
include being attracted to him, because he is single and 40 years
old.


True Tale 6
-----------

I recently heard an Induhvidual say, "I'm not a rocket surgeon."

True Tale 7
-----------

I'm a professor at a university in Georgia.  This semester, two
students misspelled THEIR OWN NAMES.

Another student could not find his way out of the building. He
thought the doors marked EXIT would set off the fire alarm.

True Tale 8
-----------

An Induhvidual in my office labeled her tape dispenser with the
word, "TAPE."

I can think of only two reasons:

1. She wanted to make sure that her tape dispenser was not used for
any unauthorized purposes,

or...

2. She feared she would not recognize the tape dispenser in the
future.


True Tale 9
-----------

One day I was sitting by my locker reading a book when my friend
walked up and asked me what I was reading. I told her, and she
said, "Wow! Where did you find that? I've been looking everywhere
for that book!" I asked her if she had looked in the library, to
which she replied that she hadn't.


True Tale 10
------------

We have to wear uniforms in gym class, but in the winter when we go
outside it becomes impractical because of the cold.  Solution:
They make us wear our uniforms UNDER our clothes!

To make matters worse, they ask for random "shorts checks" in which
we must pull our pants down a tad to show that we are following
their rules.

True Tale 11
------------

I used to work at the local government offices. I kept all my
papers in a briefcase.  One day I absentmindedly left it in a
common area.

I went back to where I had left it but it wasn't there.  I
eventually found out that the caretaker had it.  He told me, "I
thought it might be a bomb so I took it to my office."



Good Work If You Can Get It
----------------------------

A true story of a "Wally"...

One of my co-workers on a web site project got the idea that since
porn web sites have the distinction of being the only real
moneymaking web sites, they must have the best design and
implementation.  Therefore, we should research them and incorporate
their design into our web site.  He spent two days on this (at
work) and even told several others about his work.  His final
analysis was inconclusive.


Lazy Entrepreneur
------------------
http://www.unitedmedia.com/comics/dilbert/lazyentrepreneur/

The ideas are pouring in to my new web site feature, The Lazy
Entrepreneur, at Dilbert.com.  Here are some of my favorites, some
practical, some whimsical.


Toothbrush Contraceptive Pill Dispenser
----------------------------------------

Submitted by mattrogers

My girlfriend regularly forgets to take her contraceptive pill.
However, to my knowledge she has never forgotten to brush her teeth
in the morning.

Will someone please invent a toothbrush that has a contraceptive
pill dispenser in the handle?



Video Tombstones
------------------

-- Submitted by CaptainBasil

How about a DVD-based, flat screen LCD video unit embedded in a
granite tombstone, for perpetual replay of highlights of the dearly
departed's life?

[Editor's Note: Even better, how about a motion detector so your
video can pop up whenever anyone approaches.  Then add some speech
recognition and some canned replies and you can carry on simple
conversations with the dead.  Example:  You ask, "How are you
today?"  The DVD plays the answer, "Not so good.  Still dead."]



Perpetual Blanket
-----------------

-- Submitted by Trouble

It's a blanket that wraps down one side of the bed, under the bed
and up the other side of the bed, returning to the top. This way
people who have spouses that constantly steal the covers can always
have a fresh supply being drawn up from beneath.

Optional feature: Alarm when blanket is pulled to PROVE that spouse
steals the covers.


Cubicle Buzzard
---------------

-- Submitted by buzzardbert

A stuffed buzzard that can clamp onto the top of an office cubicle
wall, staring at the soon-to-be fired/retired occupant.


Whiteboard Eraser Caps
-------------------------

-- Submitted by TelekineticFool

Dry Erase markers for white boards should have little erasers on
one end, like pencils do, for erasing the occasional small mistake.
That way you don't need to use your fingers or necktie.


New Dilbert T-Shirts and Sweatshirts
---------------------------------------------------
New at Dilbert.com, you can choose one of seven of the most popular
Dilbert strips to have printed on a T-shirt or sweatshirt:

http://www.cafepress.com/static/UnitedMedia/property.jsp?property=Dilbert




Pearls Before Swine
--------------------
http://www.unitedmedia.com/comics/pearls/index.html


Check out a great new comic strip called "Pearls Before
Swine," by Stephan Pastis.  I love it, and I'm hard to please,
comic-wise. You can find it on the web by using the comics menu in
the top left corner of Dilbert.com, or by going directly to the URL
above.  Read the whole archived month to get the rhythm of it and
to get past the shocking realization that it's mostly about a rat
and a pig talking to each other.


Dogbert Answers My Mail
-----------------------

In this section Dogbert answers the mail that I am too polite to
answer myself.  These are all based on real e-mail.  The names have
been changed to make them funnier.


Dear Mr. Adams,

I had never really read your comic strips until I was forced to do
it for a Business Principles class.  You bash the workplace,
employees and employers.  You make them out to be bad and stupid
people.  That is nothing like what is really going on today in the
workforce.  You really need to think about what you are doing.

       Jennifer


Dear Jedi fur,

I wish you had given this information to Mr. Adams sooner.  He
wasted the past eleven years of his life creating inappropriate
cartoons.  He is SO-O-O-O embarrassed now.

However, Mr. Adams is still confused about the process by which
arrogant little pissant students like you become brilliant, helpful
and kind as soon as you join the workforce.  Perhaps you could
clarify that in a future correspondence.

        Sincerely,


        Dogbert


----------------


Dear Mr. Adams,

I have your 2000 Desk Calendar and I just wanted to make a minor
complaint.  I am looking at today's December 8th comic and it is
not funny at all.  Perhaps you could have others read it before you
send it off to the printers.

         Tod



Dear Toad,

Obviously you are not a student of history.  December 8th is the
official "Day After Pearl Harbor Day" and as such is often referred
to as "A day that shall live in unfunny."

        Sincerely,


        Dogbert


-----------

Dear Mr. Adams,

Your cartoons with the hand coming out of the guy's head are some
of your worst ever.  You have sunk to a new level of stupidity.

         Phil


Dear Phlegm,

Mr. Adams wanted to respond to your insightful letter by drawing a
little picture of that character making an obscene gesture to you
with the hand that's growing out of his head.  He thought this
would be, to use his words, "a hoot."

Fortunately for us all, I have too much class to allow that image
to enter anyone's mind.


        Sincerely,


        Dogbert

Dilbert Newsletter 39.0
-----------------------


To:     Dogbert's New Ruling Class (DNRC)
From:   Scott Adams (scottadams@aol.com)
Date:   December 2001



Highlights
-------------------------------------------------
* New DNRC Word
* Boss and Cow-orker quotes
* Plop Version 2.0
* True Tales of Induhviduals
* My Holiday Message
-------------------------------------------------


DNRC Update
-----------

The 400,000 members of DNRC continue to get smarter and better
looking every day. Case in point: I am typing this newsletter using
telekinesis while watching CNN in an adjoining room. And if I'm not
mistaken, Paula Zahn is trying to flirt with me.


New DNRC Word
-------------

A DNRC member suggests this new word for Osama's terrorist
organization: Al-Qae-duh.

I would love to have been a fly in Osama's beard last year when he
was discussing his plan for global conquest.

Osama: "I have an idea. Let's attack the most powerful
        nation in the history of the universe and then hide
        in caves."

Omar:  "All in favor, say eye!"

That might sound like a crazy plan to many of you, but you need to
realize that Osama grew up in Saudi Arabia where that sort of
strategy has worked in the past. In the November 12th issue of
Newsweek there's a "Special Advertising Section" where Saudi
Arabia's public relations firm describes the wonderful history of
Saudi Arabia. In 1901 a guy named Ibn Saud, along with his cousin
and 38 buddies, climbed over the fortress wall in Riyadh and waited
until the Amir came strolling by. Then Ibn and his cousin hacked
the Amir to death with swords. At this point in the story -- so you
don't think I'm making up this whole thing -- I quote from Saudi
Arabia's own P.R. article: "The Riyadh garrison, demoralized by the
death of their leader, and fearing they faced a far larger force
than 40 men, surrendered."

That's right; Ibn conquered a whole city with 40 men, of which 38
were just standing around watching. Eventually the Saud family
consolidated power, named the country after themselves and formed a
royal dynasty that is still in power. That's the inspirational
story that little Osama learned in school when he was growing up.

Who's crazy now?


True Quotes from Induhviduals
-----------------------------

Here are more true quotes submitted by DNRC members. Most of these
are from managers. As you will see, Induhviduals are confused by
anything involving critters or body parts.

"It's an exercise in fertility."

"Hindsight is 50-50."

"Just use your own excretion."

"You are never going to fail unless you try."

"We're scraping the bottom of the iceberg."

"Today is like the day Rome was built in.  We can't afford to have
any fiddlers."

"The project is going down the toilet in flames."

"He might be barking at a red herring."

"You're treading on thin water."

I think he meant we should cross our T's and dot our I's but it
came out this way: "Be sure we all cross our eyes."

"He's as deaf as a bat."

"We don't want to stick our necks out and get our asses chopped
off."

"I gave him a real mouthful."

"I really took the bull by the hands."

"He doesn't know his hole from an ass in the ground."

"You should talk to her. She is a minefield of information."

"I can't remember but it's right on the tip of my head!"

"You can lead a pig to pearls..." and then he trailed off.

"Thanksgiving is early this year because the first Thursday fell on
a Monday."

"The skeleton is there. You just have to sharpen it and put the
decorations on the tree."

And this last quote, which may or may not have come from Osama: "We
need an escape goat."


Plop Version 2.0
-----------------

In case you ever decide to start your own comic strip and you want
to solicit opinions from other people, let me give you this piece
of valuable advice. You should never -- and I mean NEVER -- give
the comic a name that rhymes with any of the following words:

Flop
Drop
Stop

That little rhyming opportunity was not lost on about two hundred
of you who thought Plop was not up to DNRC quality. Fortunately,
some people actually liked Plop. I read every comment and the
breakdown looks roughly like this:

Loved it:   33%
Liked it:   46% (thought it has potential)
Loathed it: 21%

That's a great response for a first draft of a comic. Comic strips
normally get developed for several months before the public sees
them. You're in on the ground floor.

Version 2.0 of Plop incorporates many of your comments. I renamed
Plop (because Plop was the name of a comic book in the past), I
changed Smokey's species, I made Plop more optimistic, I addressed
the hip-deep mud question and I started to fill out the
personalities of the main characters. Only a few people were
bothered by the physical similarity to the Taliban, so I'm not
going to let that bother me if the comic develops into something
worthwhile.

The new and improved strips are posted on the Web at
http://www.unitedmedia.com/comics/plop/ and begin with #21. All
comments and rhyming insults are appreciated.


Induhvidual Baby Names
----------------------

Here is further proof that all Induhviduals should be given the
same name to keep things simple.

--

A doctor friend of mine was on hand for a delivery in a maternity
unit.  The mother named her daughter Placenta.

--

I once knew a person with the tuneful name of Listerine.

--

My wife was a public social worker in South Carolina many years
ago. One of her case families had a daughter named Syphilis.  The
family pronounced it in two parts: Syph-Philis.  One day my wife
asked the mother how they came to name the child Syph Philis.  The
mother said the hospital named her, and she got a copy of the birth
certificate to prove it.

On the birth certificate was an annotation that the child was "born
of a mother with syphilis." The mother assumed the hospital had
named her child for her.

(Editor's note: That one sounds like an urban legend to me. Let me
know if you've heard it before.)


Saving the World
----------------

Here's a fun mental exercise. Try to think of any problem in the
world that wouldn't be reduced if we all did some extra shopping
this year.

How about terrorism? Let's see, if we shop a little extra, that
stimulates the economy, which increases tax collections, which pays
for more security. Ta-dah!

How about unemployment? Shopping --> stimulated economy --> more
hiring.

How about diseases? Shopping --> stimulated economy --> funding for
research.

So I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say that buying Dilbert
merchandise will solve every problem in the world. But don't think
the burden falls entirely on you. I'll meet you halfway by listing
some suggestions.

- Dilbert 2002 Day-To-Day Calendar. It's like having a book
  that you can tear up one page per day.

  You can find the calendar at this link:

  http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0740715674/ref=ase_unitedmedia/104-2285776-7245555


- "When Did Ignorance Become a Point of View?" The newest
  collection of Dilbert comics is ideal for tormenting your
  boss.

  You can find the book at:

  http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0740718398/qid%3D999892906/sr%3D2-1/ref%3Daps%5Fsr%5Fb%5F1%5F1/103-8132560-1423852


- "God's Debris" - Ponder the collision of science and God
  with my first non-Dilbert book. (Example: Do clones have
  souls?) Some people are calling it the best book they've
  ever read. Others say you shouldn't read it.

  You can find "God's Debris" here:

Things Not To Say in a Restroom
-------------------------------

I hope this doesn't spawn a new category, but these two reports
were worth mentioning.

--

As I entered the restroom, a cow-orker who had just finished his
business, turned to me and said, "Oh, hey, Brent, I was just
thinking about you."

--

At my last job, just as I was entering a restroom, a cow-orker
said, "Say, can I grab you when you're done?"



True Tales of Induhviduals
--------------------------

One of the young ladies in our office is getting ready for her
"dream" vacation to Mount Rushmore. My colleague asked her to bring
him back a picture of the other side of the mountain. When she
asked why, he proceeded to convince her that on the other side of
Mount Rushmore are the backs of the presidents, on their knees,
with their heads stuck into the mountain. She is so excited that
she is going to look for a special tour of the backside.

--

I went to a home improvement store to buy a new faucet for my
kitchen sink. I did not see the particular model I had in mind, so
I asked one of the Induhvidual employees for assistance.

He said, "We stopped selling that model because it was the number
one theft item in the store." I waited to hear the punchline, until
I realized he was serious.

I might have to find a new home improvement store if they ever
achieve their goal of carrying no products worth stealing.

--

During a round of layoffs at the company, a farewell card for one
unfortunate cow-orker was circulated. People were signing the card
with "good luck!" and "Been great working with you" and so on.
When the card got to the desk of one manager, he did not bother to
read the card.  He just wrote "Happy Birthday" and signed his name.

--

A pool hall put up a sign in their front window that read:
"Profound language prohibited within." I could just imagine some
people discussing the meaning of life and being told to take it
outside.

--

While traveling on business in Norfolk, Nebraska, I noticed a
Ramada Inn sign:

        "Plan your next affair here"

The next day the sign was taken down.

--

At a business lunch, platters of calamari were passed down the
tables. As a platter reached one of the employee's wives, she was
heard to remark during an unfortunate lull in the conversation,
"No, thanks. I never eat anything with testicles attached."

The stricken silence lasted a few moments. Then 150 people lost it.


--

I work in a camera store.  An Induhvidual came in and said his
camera wasn't working and asked me if I could look at it.  I agreed
and said I would check the battery first.  The Induhvidual said,
"I've had this battery for five years and I've never had any
problems with it before."

I changed the battery and the camera worked.


--

I would like to shove a live bear cub up my boss's nose and then
have the mother bear go after him whenever he opens a phone
conversation with, "Hi buddy how's it going yeah me too!"

--

My boss was having a discussion with another employee about some
work rules that pertain to people doing manual labor.  He said
these rules don't apply to us because we don't use manuals.

--

Yesterday my boss called me and said, "Effective immediately, I
want you to stop your current activity and start working on this
new area." When I asked specifically what I was supposed to do, he
replied: "It was not my intention to give you a task today, just a
mind-set!"


My Holiday Message
------------------

I've written and rewritten this section a dozen times. My problem
is that no matter how much I write, I keep condensing it down to
the same thought: This holiday season, as we laugh and eat and shop
and enjoy friends and family, our soldiers are in Afghanistan
risking everything for us. Some of them won't come back. The rest
will never be the same.

Every one of them volunteered. They think we're worth it.

Let's prove them right.



Dilbert Fodder
---------------

What's bugging you about your job?  Let me know and you might see
it in a Dilbert comic or newsletter.  The best comic fodder
involves workplace peeves, devious strategies, frustrations of
dealing with others, conflicting objectives, unintended management
consequences, and of course my favorite - idiot bosses.

And I love True Tales of Induhviduals.

And if you're seeing any new management trends that need to be
mocked, I can help.  Send your suggestions to me at
scottadams@aol.com.  Short ones are better.

this is an old one but a great one.
If you dont like this email, then you just don't understand.



A chronology of events for Saturday,  December 4, 1999,
and the early morning hours of Sunday,
December 5, 1999:
6:00 Arise, play the Eyes of Texas and
Texas Fight at
full-freaking blast
6:20 Get in car, drive to New Braunfels

7:30 Tee off (me and a buddy were the
FIRST tee-time
of the morning)
8:50 Turn 9 (crack open first beer)
8:53 Crack open second beer
8:58 Crack open...(you get the idea)
10:30 Finish 18 (holes, as well as
beers), sign
scorecard for smoooooth 95
10:35 Headed for San Antonio
10:50 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and
post-game
festivities
11:10 We decide we don't have enough
booze, so we
double-back to a liquor store and buy
the good ol' 750
ml plastic bottle "Traveler" Jim Beam
11:50 Arrive at the tailgate spot.
Awesome day. Not
a single cloud in the sky. About 70
degrees.
11:55 I decide that we're going to kick
the shit out
of Nebraska.
11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to
go fuck
himself.
12:15 The UT band walks by on the way
to the
Alamodome. We're on the second floor of
a two-story
parking garage on the corner (a couple
hundred of us).
We're hooting and hollering like
wildmen. The band
doubles back to the street right below
us and
serenades us with Texas Fight and The
Eyes of Texas.
AWESOME MOMENT.
12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity,
50-100 grown
men are bumping chests with one
another, each and
every one of them now secure and
certain of the fact
that we are going to kick the
shit out of Nebraska.
1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the
way to the
Alamodome. Again, we hoot and holler
like wildmen.
Again, the band doubles back and stops
right below us
to serenade us, this time, however,
with the Nebraska
fight songs. Although somewhat
impressed by their
spirit and verve, we remain convinced
that we are
going to kick the shit out of
Nebraska.
1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome,
somehow
managing to stuff the "Traveler" and 11
cans of beer
into my pants.
1:47 I am in line surrounded by
Nebraska fans. They
are taunting me. I am taunting back,
still certain
that we are going to kick the
shit out of Nebraska. I
decide to challenge a particularly
vocal Nebraska fan
to play what I now call and will
forever be remembered
as "Cell-Phone Flop Out." Remember flop
out for a
dollar? The rules are similar. I tell
this Nebraska
jackass that if he's so confident in
his team, he
should "flop out" his cell phone RIGHT
NOW and make
plane reservations to Phoenix for the
Fiesta Bowl.
And then I spoke these memorable words:
"And not
those
damn refundable tickets, either! You
request those
non-refundable, non-transferrable
sons-of-bitches!"
He backs down. He is unworthy. I call
Southwest
Airlines and buy two tickets to
Phoenix,
non-refundable
and non-transferrable. Price: $712. He
is humbled.
He lowers his head in shame. I raise my
cell phone in
triumph to the cheers of hundreds of
Texas fans. I am
KING and these are my subjects. I
distribute the 11
beers in my pants to the cheering
masses. I RULE the
pre-game kingdom.
2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence,
I open the
Traveler and pour my first stiffy.
2:45 I notice something troubling:
Nebraska is big.
Nebraska is fast. Nebraska is very
pissed off at
Texas.
3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends.
9 yards
total offense for Texas. Zero first
downs for Texas.
I'm still talking shit. I pour
another stiffy from
the Traveler.
3:36 Four minutes to go in the first
half: the
Traveler is a dead soldier. I buy my
first $5 beer
from the Alamodome merchants. While I
am standing in
line, a center snap nearly decapitates
Major
Applewhite
and rolls out of the end zone. Safety.
3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas
0. I wish I
had another Traveler.
4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska
fan in the
bathroom at halftime, I attempt to
revive the classic
Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:
"Hey, buddy,
niiiiiiiiice cock." He is
unamused.
4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from
the Alamodome
merchants. I share my beer with two
high school girls
sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they
are equipped
with a flask full of vodka. I send them
off to
purchase $5 Sprites, so that we may
consume their
vodka. I have not lost faith. Nebraska
is a bunch of
pussies.
4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting
behind me have
fled for their lives. I purchase two
more $5 beers
from the Alamodome merchants.
5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I
am beginning
to lose faith. This normally would
trouble me, but I
am too drunk to see the football field.

5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: "I'm
sorry, sir.
Those tickets have been confirmed and
are
non-refundable and non-transferrable."
5:37 I try to start a fight with every
person behind
the concession counter. As it turns
out, the
Alamodome has a policy that no beer can
be sold when
there is less than 10 minutes on the
game clock. I am
enraged by this policy. I ask loudly:
"Why the fuck
didn't you announce last call over the
fucking PA
system??!!"
5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in
my chair in
defeat. All of a sudden, the Texas
crowd goes
absolutely nuts. "Whazzis?," I mutter,
awaking from
my coma, "Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?"
Alas, the
answer is no, we were not winning and
we did not
score.
The largest (by far) cheer of the day
from the Texas
faithful occurred when the handlers
were walking back
to the tunnel and Bevo stopped to take
a gargantuan
shit all over the letters "S",
"K", and "A" in the
"Nebraska" spelled out in their end
zone. I cheer
wildly. I pick up the empty Traveler
bottle and stick
my tongue in it. I am thirsty.
6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as
I walk back
to the truck. I would taunt them with
some off-color
remarks about their parentage, but I am
too drunk to
form complete sentences. With my last
cognitive
thought of the evening, I take solace
in the fact that
if we had not beaten them in October,
they would be
playing Florida State for the national
championship.
6:30 Back in the car. On the way back
to Austin for
the 8:00 Texas-Arizona tip off. We can
still salvage
the day! I crack open a beer. It is
warm. I don't
care.
7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am
hungry. I go
inside the store. I walk past the beer
frig. I
notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I
wonder if
it's any good. I pull a Zima from the
frig. I twist
the top off and drink the Zima in three
swallows.
Zima
sucks. I replace the empty bottle in
the frig.
7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the
store. I walk to
where the ingredients are, where the
person usually
makes the sub. There is no one there. I
lean over
the counter and scoop out half a bucket
of black
olives. I eat them. I am still hungry.
I lean
further over the counter and grab
approximately two
pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the
store
grunting and eating Pastrami. The
patrons in the
store fear me. I don't care.
8:01 We are in South Austin. I have
been drinking
warm beer and singing Brooks and Dunn
tunes for over
an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my
singing. He
suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn
have written
other good songs besides "You're Going
to Miss Me When
I'm Gone" and "Neon Moon" and that
maybe listening to
only those two songs, ten times each
was a bit
excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I
could just let the
CD play on its own. I tell him to
fuck off and
restart "Neon Moon."
8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My
truckmate,
against my loud and profane
protestations, parks on
the top floor of a nearby parking
garage. I tell him
he's an idiot. I tell him we will never
get out. I
tell him we may as well pitch a
fucking tent here. He
ignores me. I think he's still pissed
about the
Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle "Neon
Moon" loudly.
8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers
stuffed in
my pants. We're going to kick the
shit out of
Arizona.
9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona
29. I am
pleased. I go to the bathroom to pee
for the 67th
time today. I giggle to myself because
of the
new opportunity to do "the bathroom
Brice." There are
no Arizona fans in the bathroom. I am
disappointed.
I tell myself (out loud) that I have a
"Niiiiiice
cock." No one is amused but me.
9:41 I walk to the bathroom while
drinking Bud Light
out of a can. Needless to say, they do
not sell beer
at the Erwin Center, much less Bud
Light out of a can.
I am stopped by an usher: "Where did
you get
that, sir?" I tell him (no shit):
"Oh, the
cheerleaders were throwing them up with
those little
plastic footballs. Would you mind
throwing this away
for me?" I take the last swig and hand
it to him. He
is confused. I pretend I'm going to the
bathroom, but
I run away giggling instead. I duck
into some
entrance to avoid the usher, who is now
pursuing me.
I sneak into a large group of people
and sit down.
The
usher walks by harmlessly. I am
giggling like a little
girl. I crack open another can of Bud
Light.
9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid
the usher, I
have lost my bearings. I have no ticket
stub. I
cannot find my seats. Texas is losing.
10:09 Texas is being screwed by the
refs. I am
enraged. I have cleared out the seats
around me
because I keep removing my hat and
beating the
surrounding chairs with it. A concerned
fan asks if
I'm OK and perhaps I shouldn't take it
so seriously.
I tell him to fuck off.
10:15 After the fourth consecutive
"worst fucking
call I have EVER seen," I attempt to
remove my hat
again to begin beating inanimate
objects. However, on
this occasion I miscalculate and I
thumbnail myself in
my left eyelid, leaving a one-quarter
inch gash over
my eye. I am now bleeding into my left
eye and all
over my shirt. "Perhaps," I think to
myself, "I'm
taking this a bit seriously."
10:22 I am standing in the bathroom
peeing. I'm so
drunk I am swaying and grunting. I have
a bloody
napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants
are bloody.
I have my (formerly) white shirt
wrapped around my
waist. I look like I should be in an
episode of Cops.
10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody
white shirt
back on my body and make my way for the
exits. I am
stopped every 20 seconds by a good
samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me
why I am
covered in blood, but I merely grunt
incoherently and
keep moving.
10:59 With my one good eye, I have
located the
parking garage. I walk up six flights
of stairs,
promise that when I see my friend I
will punch him
in the face for making me walk up six
flights of
stairs, find the truck, and collapse in
a heap in the
bed of the truck. I look around and
notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around
the garage, six
whole flights, and no one is moving. I
take a nap.
11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my
friend in the
driver's seat. I lift my head to look
out the bed of
the truck and notice that traffic is
lined up all the
way around the garage, six whole
flights, and no one
is
moving. I am too tired to punch my
friend. I call my
friend a "Stupid fuck."
11:31 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a "Stupid fuck."

11:38 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a "Stupid fuck."

11:47 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a "Stupid fuck."

11:58 I am jostled. The truck is
moving. I lift my
head to look out the bed of the truck
and notice that
traffic is beginning to move on the
second floor. I
jump out of the truck, walk to the edge
of the parking
facility, and pee off the sixth floor
onto the street
below. My friend looks at me like I
just anally
violated his minor sister. I turn
around and pee
on the front of his truck while singing
the lyrics
to "Neon Moon."
12:11 We are moving. We are out of
beer. I jump
from the truck and go from vehicle to
vehicle until
someone gives me two beers. I am happy.
I return to
my vehicle.
12:26 We have emerged from the parking
facility. We
make our way to my apartment and find
Ed sitting on
the couch with a freshly opened bottle
of Glenlivet on
the coffee table in front of him. We
are all going to
die tonight.
12:59 We have finished three-quarters
of the bottle
of Glenlivet. We decide it would be a
wonderful idea
to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has
to pee. He
walks down the hall to our apartment
and directly into
the full length mirror at the end of
the hall,
smashing it into hundreds of pieces. We
giggle
uncontrollably and leave for
PollyEsther's.
1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs
uncontrollably
at our efforts to enter his club.
"Fellas," he says
in between his fits of spastic
laughter, "I've been
working this door for almost a year.
I've been
working
doors in this town for almost 5 years.
And I can
honestly say that I ain't never seen
three drunker
mother fuckers than you three.
Sorry, can't let you
in." We attempt to reason with him. He
laughs
harder.
1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We
take two
steps in the door and hear "Last call
for alcohol!" I
turn to the group and mutter: "See, dat
wasn't that
fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that
at the
Awamo...the awaom...the
alab...fuck it, that stadium
we
was at today..." We order 6 shots of
tequila and
three beers.
2:15 Back on the street. We need food.
We hail a
cab to take us the two and one half
blocks to Katz's.
The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10
and tell him
to keep it.
2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give
the hostess
$50. We are seated immediately.
2:25 We order two orders of fried
pickles, a Cobb
salad, a bowl of soup, two orders of
Blueberry
blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a
hamburger, two
cheese stuffed potatoes, an order of
fries, and an
order of onion rings.
2:39 The food arrives. We are all
asleep with our
heads on the table. The waiter wakes us
up. We eat
every fucking bit of our food. Most
of the restaurant
patrons around us are disgusted. We
don't give a
shit.
The tab is $112 with tip.
2:46 I'm sleepy.
9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman.
She is the
bartender at Katz's. She is not pretty.

Nebraska fans. They
are taunting me. I am taunting back,
still certain
that we are going to kick the
shit out of Nebraska. I
decide to challenge a particularly
vocal Nebraska fan
to play what I now call and will
forever be remembered
as "Cell-Phone Flop Out." Remember flop
out for a
dollar? The rules are similar. I tell
this Nebraska
jackass that if he's so confident in
his team, he
should "flop out" his cell phone RIGHT
NOW and make
plane reservations to Phoenix for the
Fiesta Bowl.
And then I spoke these memorable words:
"And not
those
damn refundable tickets, either! You
request those
non-refundable, non-transferrable
sons-of-bitches!"
He backs down. He is unworthy. I call
Southwest
Airlines and buy two tickets to
Phoenix,
non-refundable
and non-transferrable. Price: $712. He
is humbled.
He lowers his head in shame. I raise my
cell phone in
triumph to the cheers of hundreds of
Texas fans. I am
KING and these are my subjects. I
distribute the 11
beers in my pants to the cheering
masses. I RULE the
pre-game kingdom.
2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence,
I open the
Traveler and pour my first stiffy.
2:45 I notice something troubling:
Nebraska is big.
Nebraska is fast. Nebraska is very
pissed off at
Texas.
3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends.
9 yards
total offense for Texas. Zero first
downs for Texas.
I'm still talking shit. I pour
another stiffy from
the Traveler.
3:36 Four minutes to go in the first
half: the
Traveler is a dead soldier. I buy my
first $5 beer
from the Alamodome merchants. While I
am standing in
line, a center snap nearly decapitates
Major
Applewhite
and rolls out of the end zone. Safety.
3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas
0. I wish I
had another Traveler.
4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska
fan in the
bathroom at halftime, I attempt to
revive the classic
Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:
"Hey, buddy,
niiiiiiiiice cock." He is
unamused.
4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from
the Alamodome
merchants. I share my beer with two
high school girls
sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they
are equipped
with a flask full of vodka. I send them
off to
purchase $5 Sprites, so that we may
consume their
vodka. I have not lost faith. Nebraska
is a bunch of
pussies.
4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting
behind me have
fled for their lives. I purchase two
more $5 beers
from the Alamodome merchants.
5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I
am beginning
to lose faith. This normally would
trouble me, but I
am too drunk to see the football field.

5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: "I'm
sorry, sir.
Those tickets have been confirmed and
are
non-refundable and non-transferrable."
5:37 I try to start a fight with every
person behind
the concession counter. As it turns
out, the
Alamodome has a policy that no beer can
be sold when
there is less than 10 minutes on the
game clock. I am
enraged by this policy. I ask loudly:
"Why the fuck
didn't you announce last call over the
fucking PA
system??!!"
5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in
my chair in
defeat. All of a sudden, the Texas
crowd goes
absolutely nuts. "Whazzis?," I mutter,
awaking from
my coma, "Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?"
Alas, the
answer is no, we were not winning and
we did not
score.
The largest (by far) cheer of the day
from the Texas
faithful occurred when the handlers
were walking back
to the tunnel and Bevo stopped to take
a gargantuan
shit all over the letters "S",
"K", and "A" in the
"Nebraska" spelled out in their end
zone. I cheer
wildly. I pick up the empty Traveler
bottle and stick
my tongue in it. I am thirsty.
6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as
I walk back
to the truck. I would taunt them with
some off-color
remarks about their parentage, but I am
too drunk to
form complete sentences. With my last
cognitive
thought of the evening, I take solace
in the fact that
if we had not beaten them in October,
they would be
playing Florida State for the national
championship.
6:30 Back in the car. On the way back
to Austin for
the 8:00 Texas-Arizona tip off. We can
still salvage
the day! I crack open a beer. It is
warm. I don't
care.
7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am
hungry. I go
inside the store. I walk past the beer
frig. I
notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I
wonder if
it's any good. I pull a Zima from the
frig. I twist
the top off and drink the Zima in three
swallows.
Zima
sucks. I replace the empty bottle in
the frig.
7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the
store. I walk to
where the ingredients are, where the
person usually
makes the sub. There is no one there. I
lean over
the counter and scoop out half a bucket
of black
olives. I eat them. I am still hungry.
I lean
further over the counter and grab
approximately two
pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the
store
grunting and eating Pastrami. The
patrons in the
store fear me. I don't care.
8:01 We are in South Austin. I have
been drinking
warm beer and singing Brooks and Dunn
tunes for over
an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my
singing. He
suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn
have written
other good songs besides "You're Going
to Miss Me When
I'm Gone" and "Neon Moon" and that
maybe listening to
only those two songs, ten times each
was a bit
excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I
could just let the
CD play on its own. I tell him to
fuck off and
restart "Neon Moon."
8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My
truckmate,
against my loud and profane
protestations, parks on
the top floor of a nearby parking
garage. I tell him
he's an idiot. I tell him we will never
get out. I
tell him we may as well pitch a
fucking tent here. He
ignores me. I think he's still pissed
about the
Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle "Neon
Moon" loudly.
8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers
stuffed in
my pants. We're going to kick the
shit out of
Arizona.
9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona
29. I am
pleased. I go to the bathroom to pee
for the 67th
time today. I giggle to myself because
of the
new opportunity to do "the bathroom
Brice." There are
no Arizona fans in the bathroom. I am
disappointed.
I tell myself (out loud) that I have a
"Niiiiiice
cock." No one is amused but me.
9:41 I walk to the bathroom while
drinking Bud Light
out of a can. Needless to say, they do
not sell beer
at the Erwin Center, much less Bud
Light out of a can.
I am stopped by an usher: "Where did
you get
that, sir?" I tell him (no shit):
"Oh, the
cheerleaders were throwing them up with
those little
plastic footballs. Would you mind
throwing this away
for me?" I take the last swig and hand
it to him. He
is confused. I pretend I'm going to the
bathroom, but
I run away giggling instead. I duck
into some
entrance to avoid the usher, who is now
pursuing me.
I sneak into a large group of people
and sit down.
The
usher walks by harmlessly. I am
giggling like a little
girl. I crack open another can of Bud
Light.
9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid
the usher, I
have lost my bearings. I have no ticket
stub. I
cannot find my seats. Texas is losing.
10:09 Texas is being screwed by the
refs. I am
enraged. I have cleared out the seats
around me
because I keep removing my hat and
beating the
surrounding chairs with it. A concerned
fan asks if
I'm OK and perhaps I shouldn't take it
so seriously.
I tell him to fuck off.
10:15 After the fourth consecutive
"worst fucking
call I have EVER seen," I attempt to
remove my hat
again to begin beating inanimate
objects. However, on
this occasion I miscalculate and I
thumbnail myself in
my left eyelid, leaving a one-quarter
inch gash over
my eye. I am now bleeding into my left
eye and all
over my shirt. "Perhaps," I think to
myself, "I'm
taking this a bit seriously."
10:22 I am standing in the bathroom
peeing. I'm so
drunk I am swaying and grunting. I have
a bloody
napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants
are bloody.
I have my (formerly) white shirt
wrapped around my
waist. I look like I should be in an
episode of Cops.
10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody
white shirt
back on my body and make my way for the
exits. I am
stopped every 20 seconds by a good
samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me
why I am
covered in blood, but I merely grunt
incoherently and
keep moving.
10:59 With my one good eye, I have
located the
parking garage. I walk up six flights
of stairs,
promise that when I see my friend I
will punch him
in the face for making me walk up six
flights of
stairs, find the truck, and collapse in
a heap in the
bed of the truck. I look around and
notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around
the garage, six
whole flights, and no one is moving. I
take a nap.
11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my
friend in the
driver's seat. I lift my head to look
out the bed of
the truck and notice that traffic is
lined up all the
way around the garage, six whole
flights, and no one
is
moving. I am too tired to punch my
friend. I call my
friend a "Stupid fuck."
11:31 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a "Stupid fuck."

11:38 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a "Stupid fuck."

11:47 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a "Stupid fuck."

11:58 I am jostled. The truck is
moving. I lift my
head to look out the bed of the truck
and notice that
traffic is beginning to move on the
second floor. I
jump out of the truck, walk to the edge
of the parking
facility, and pee off the sixth floor
onto the street
below. My friend looks at me like I
just anally
violated his minor sister. I turn
around and pee
on the front of his truck while singing
the lyrics
to "Neon Moon."
12:11 We are moving. We are out of
beer. I jump
from the truck and go from vehicle to
vehicle until
someone gives me two beers. I am happy.
I return to
my vehicle.
12:26 We have emerged from the parking
facility. We
make our way to my apartment and find
Ed sitting on
the couch with a freshly opened bottle
of Glenlivet on
the coffee table in front of him. We
are all going to
die tonight.
12:59 We have finished three-quarters
of the bottle
of Glenlivet. We decide it would be a
wonderful idea
to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has
to pee. He
walks down the hall to our apartment
and directly into
the full length mirror at the end of
the hall,
smashing it into hundreds of pieces. We
giggle
uncontrollably and leave for
PollyEsther's.
1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs
uncontrollably
at our efforts to enter his club.
"Fellas," he says
in between his fits of spastic
laughter, "I've been
working this door for almost a year.
I've been
working
doors in this town for almost 5 years.
And I can
honestly say that I ain't never seen
three drunker
mother fuckers than you three.
Sorry, can't let you
in." We attempt to reason with him. He
laughs
harder.
1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We
take two
steps in the door and hear "Last call
for alcohol!" I
turn to the group and mutter: "See, dat
wasn't that
fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that
at the
Awamo...the awaom...the
alab...fuck it, that stadium
we
was at today..." We order 6 shots of
tequila and
three beers.
2:15 Back on the street. We need food.
We hail a
cab to take us the two and one half
blocks to Katz's.
The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10
and tell him
to keep it.
2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give
the hostess
$50. We are seated immediately.
2:25 We order two orders of fried
pickles, a Cobb
salad, a bowl of soup, two orders of
Blueberry
blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a
hamburger, two
cheese stuffed potatoes, an order of
fries, and an
order of onion rings.
2:39 The food arrives. We are all
asleep with our
heads on the table. The waiter wakes us
up. We eat
every fucking bit of our food. Most
of the restaurant
patrons around us are disgusted. We
don't give a
shit.
The tab is $112 with tip.
2:46 I'm sleepy.
9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman.
She is the
bartender at Katz's. She is not pretty.

Subject:	[Fwd: a day in the life]

this is an old one but a great one.
If you dont like this email, then you just don't understand.



A chronology of events for Saturday,  December 4, 1999,
and the early morning hours of Sunday,
December 5, 1999:
6:00 Arise, play the Eyes of Texas and
Texas Fight at
full-freaking blast
6:20 Get in car, drive to New Braunfels

7:30 Tee off (me and a buddy were the
FIRST tee-time
of the morning)
8:50 Turn 9 (crack open first beer)
8:53 Crack open second beer
8:58 Crack open...(you get the idea)
10:30 Finish 18 (holes, as well as
beers), sign
scorecard for smoooooth 95
10:35 Headed for San Antonio
10:50 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and
post-game
festivities
11:10 We decide we don't have enough
booze, so we
double-back to a liquor store and buy
the good ol' 750
ml plastic bottle "Traveler" Jim Beam
11:50 Arrive at the tailgate spot.
Awesome day. Not
a single cloud in the sky. About 70
degrees.
11:55 I decide that we're going to kick
the shit out
of Nebraska.
11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to
go fuck
himself.
12:15 The UT band walks by on the way
to the
Alamodome. We're on the second floor of
a two-story
parking garage on the corner (a couple
hundred of us).
We're hooting and hollering like
wildmen. The band
doubles back to the street right below
us and
serenades us with Texas Fight and The
Eyes of Texas.
AWESOME MOMENT.
12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity,
50-100 grown
men are bumping chests with one
another, each and
every one of them now secure and
certain of the fact
that we are going to kick the
shit out of Nebraska.
1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the
way to the
Alamodome. Again, we hoot and holler
like wildmen.
Again, the band doubles back and stops
right below us
to serenade us, this time, however,
with the Nebraska
fight songs. Although somewhat
impressed by their
spirit and verve, we remain convinced
that we are
going to kick the shit out of
Nebraska.
1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome,
somehow
managing to stuff the "Traveler" and 11
cans of beer
into my pants.
1:47 I am in line surrounded by
Nebraska fans. They
are taunting me. I am taunting back,
still certain
that we are going to kick the
shit out of Nebraska. I
decide to challenge a particularly

to play what I now call and will
forever be remembered
as "Cell-Phone Flop Out." Remember flop

the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a "Stupid fuck."

11:47 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a "Stupid fuck."

11:58 I am jostled. The truck is
moving. I lift my
head to look out the bed of the truck
and notice that
traffic is beginning to move on the
second floor. I
jump out of the truck, walk to the edge
of the parking
facility, and pee off the sixth floor
onto the street
below. My friend looks at me like I
just anally
violated his minor sister. I turn
around and pee
on the front of his truck while singing
the lyrics
to "Neon Moon."
12:11 We are moving. We are out of
beer. I jump
from the truck and go from vehicle to
vehicle until
someone gives me two beers. I am happy.
I return to
my vehicle.
12:26 We have emerged from the parking
facility. We
make our way to my apartment and find
Ed sitting on
the couch with a freshly opened bottle
of Glenlivet on
the coffee table in front of him. We
are all going to
die tonight.
12:59 We have finished three-quarters
of the bottle
of Glenlivet. We decide it would be a
wonderful idea
to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has
to pee. He
walks down the hall to our apartment
and directly into
the full length mirror at the end of
the hall,
smashing it into hundreds of pieces. We
giggle
uncontrollably and leave for
PollyEsther's.
1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs
uncontrollably
at our efforts to enter his club.
"Fellas," he says
in between his fits of spastic
laughter, "I've been
working this door for almost a year.
I've been
working
doors in this town for almost 5 years.
And I can
honestly say that I ain't never seen
three drunker
mother fuckers than you three.
Sorry, can't let you
in." We attempt to reason with him. He
laughs
harder.
1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We
take two
steps in the door and hear "Last call
for alcohol!" I
turn to the group and mutter: "See, dat
wasn't that
fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that
at the
Awamo...the awaom...the
alab...fuck it, that stadium
we
was at today..." We order 6 shots of
tequila and
three beers.
2:15 Back on the street. We need food.
We hail a
cab to take us the two and one half
blocks to Katz's.
The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10
and tell him
to keep it.
2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give
the hostess
$50. We are seated immediately.
2:25 We order two orders of fried
pickles, a Cobb
salad, a bowl of soup, two orders of
Blueberry
blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a
hamburger, two
cheese stuffed potatoes, an order of
fries, and an
order of onion rings.
2:39 The food arrives. We are all
asleep with our
heads on the table. The waiter wakes us
up. We eat
every fucking bit of our food. Most
of the restaurant
patrons around us are disgusted. We
don't give a
shit.
The tab is $112 with tip.
2:46 I'm sleepy.
9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman.
She is the
bartender at Katz's. She is not pretty.

this is an old one but a great one.
If you dont like this email, then you just don't understand.



A chronology of events for Saturday,  December 4, 1999,
and the early morning hours of Sunday,
December 5, 1999:
6:00 Arise, play the Eyes of Texas and
Texas Fight at
full-freaking blast
6:20 Get in car, drive to New Braunfels

7:30 Tee off (me and a buddy were the
FIRST tee-time
of the morning)
8:50 Turn 9 (crack open first beer)
8:53 Crack open second beer
8:58 Crack open...(you get the idea)
10:30 Finish 18 (holes, as well as
beers), sign
scorecard for smoooooth 95
10:35 Headed for San Antonio
10:50 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and
post-game
festivities
11:10 We decide we don't have enough
booze, so we
double-back to a liquor store and buy
the good ol' 750
ml plastic bottle "Traveler" Jim Beam
11:50 Arrive at the tailgate spot.
Awesome day. Not
a single cloud in the sky. About 70
degrees.
11:55 I decide that we're going to kick
the shit out
of Nebraska.
11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to
go fuck
himself.
12:15 The UT band walks by on the way
to the
Alamodome. We're on the second floor of
a two-story
parking garage on the corner (a couple
hundred of us).
We're hooting and hollering like
wildmen. The band
doubles back to the street right below
us and
serenades us with Texas Fight and The
Eyes of Texas.
AWESOME MOMENT.
12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity,
50-100 grown
men are bumping chests with one
another, each and
every one of them now secure and
certain of the fact
that we are going to kick the
shit out of Nebraska.
1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the
way to the
Alamodome. Again, we hoot and holler
like wildmen.
Again, the band doubles back and stops
right below us
to serenade us, this time, however,
with the Nebraska
fight songs. Although somewhat
impressed by their
spirit and verve, we remain convinced
that we are
going to kick the shit out of
Nebraska.
1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome,
somehow
managing to stuff the "Traveler" and 11
cans of beer
into my pants.
1:47 I am in line surrounded by
Nebraska fans. They
are taunting me. I am taunting back,
still certain
that we are going to kick the
shit out of Nebraska. I
decide to challenge a particularly
vocal Nebraska fan
to play what I now call and will
forever be remembered
as "Cell-Phone Flop Out." Remember flop
out for a
dollar? The rules are similar. I tell
this Nebraska
jackass that if he's so confident in
his team, he
should "flop out" his cell phone RIGHT
NOW and make
plane reservations to Phoenix for the
Fiesta Bowl.
And then I spoke these memorable words:
"And not
those
damn refundable tickets, either! You
request those
non-refundable, non-transferrable
sons-of-bitches!"
He backs down. He is unworthy. I call
Southwest
Airlines and buy two tickets to
Phoenix,
non-refundable
and non-transferrable. Price: $712. He
is humbled.
He lowers his head in shame. I raise my
cell phone in
triumph to the cheers of hundreds of
Texas fans. I am
KING and these are my subjects. I
distribute the 11
beers in my pants to the cheering
masses. I RULE the
pre-game kingdom.
2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence,
I open the
Traveler and pour my first stiffy.
2:45 I notice something troubling:
Nebraska is big.
Nebraska is fast. Nebraska is very
pissed off at
Texas.
3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends.
9 yards
total offense for Texas. Zero first
downs for Texas.
I'm still talking shit. I pour
another stiffy from
the Traveler.
3:36 Four minutes to go in the first
half: the
Traveler is a dead soldier. I buy my
first $5 beer
from the Alamodome merchants. While I
am standing in
line, a center snap nearly decapitates
Major
Applewhite
and rolls out of the end zone. Safety.
3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas
0. I wish I
had another Traveler.
4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska
fan in the
bathroom at halftime, I attempt to
revive the classic
Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:
"Hey, buddy,
niiiiiiiiice cock." He is
unamused.
4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from
the Alamodome
merchants. I share my beer with two
high school girls
sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they
are equipped
with a flask full of vodka. I send them
off to
purchase $5 Sprites, so that we may
consume their
vodka. I have not lost faith. Nebraska
is a bunch of
pussies.
4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting
behind me have
fled for their lives. I purchase two
more $5 beers
from the Alamodome merchants.
5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I
am beginning
to lose faith. This normally would
trouble me, but I
am too drunk to see the football field.

5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: "I'm
sorry, sir.
Those tickets have been confirmed and
are
non-refundable and non-transferrable."
5:37 I try to start a fight with every
person behind
the concession counter. As it turns
out, the
Alamodome has a policy that no beer can
be sold when
there is less than 10 minutes on the
game clock. I am
enraged by this policy. I ask loudly:
"Why the fuck
didn't you announce last call over the
fucking PA
system??!!"
5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in
my chair in
defeat. All of a sudden, the Texas
crowd goes
absolutely nuts. "Whazzis?," I mutter,
awaking from
my coma, "Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?"
Alas, the
answer is no, we were not winning and
we did not
score.
The largest (by far) cheer of the day
from the Texas
faithful occurred when the handlers
were walking back
to the tunnel and Bevo stopped to take
a gargantuan
shit all over the letters "S",
"K", and "A" in the
"Nebraska" spelled out in their end
zone. I cheer
wildly. I pick up the empty Traveler
bottle and stick
my tongue in it. I am thirsty.
6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as
I walk back
to the truck. I would taunt them with
some off-color
remarks about their parentage, but I am
too drunk to
form complete sentences. With my last
cognitive
thought of the evening, I take solace
in the fact that
if we had not beaten them in October,
they would be
playing Florida State for the national
championship.
6:30 Back in the car. On the way back
to Austin for
the 8:00 Texas-Arizona tip off. We can
still salvage
the day! I crack open a beer. It is
warm. I don't
care.
7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am
hungry. I go
inside the store. I walk past the beer
frig. I
notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I
wonder if
it's any good. I pull a Zima from the
frig. I twist
the top off and drink the Zima in three
swallows.
Zima
sucks. I replace the empty bottle in
the frig.
7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the
store. I walk to
where the ingredients are, where the
person usually
makes the sub. There is no one there. I
lean over
the counter and scoop out half a bucket
of black
olives. I eat them. I am still hungry.
I lean
further over the counter and grab
approximately two
pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the
store
grunting and eating Pastrami. The
patrons in the
store fear me. I don't care.
8:01 We are in South Austin. I have
been drinking
warm beer and singing Brooks and Dunn
tunes for over
an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my
singing. He
suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn
have written
other good songs besides "You're Going
to Miss Me When
I'm Gone" and "Neon Moon" and that
maybe listening to
only those two songs, ten times each
was a bit
excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I
could just let the
CD play on its own. I tell him to
fuck off and
restart "Neon Moon."
8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My
truckmate,
against my loud and profane
protestations, parks on
the top floor of a nearby parking
garage. I tell him
he's an idiot. I tell him we will never
get out. I
tell him we may as well pitch a
fucking tent here. He
ignores me. I think he's still pissed
about the
Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle "Neon
Moon" loudly.
8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers
stuffed in
my pants. We're going to kick the
shit out of
Arizona.
9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona
29. I am
pleased. I go to the bathroom to pee
for the 67th
time today. I giggle to myself because
of the
new opportunity to do "the bathroom
Brice." There are
no Arizona fans in the bathroom. I am
disappointed.
I tell myself (out loud) that I have a
"Niiiiiice
cock." No one is amused but me.
9:41 I walk to the bathroom while
drinking Bud Light
out of a can. Needless to say, they do
not sell beer
at the Erwin Center, much less Bud
Light out of a can.
I am stopped by an usher: "Where did
you get
that, sir?" I tell him (no shit):
"Oh, the
cheerleaders were throwing them up with
those little
plastic footballs. Would you mind
throwing this away
for me?" I take the last swig and hand
it to him. He
is confused. I pretend I'm going to the
bathroom, but
I run away giggling instead. I duck
into some
entrance to avoid the usher, who is now
pursuing me.
I sneak into a large group of people
and sit down.
The
usher walks by harmlessly. I am
giggling like a little
girl. I crack open another can of Bud
Light.
9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid
the usher, I
have lost my bearings. I have no ticket
stub. I
cannot find my seats. Texas is losing.
10:09 Texas is being screwed by the
refs. I am
enraged. I have cleared out the seats
around me
because I keep removing my hat and
beating the
surrounding chairs with it. A concerned
fan asks if
I'm OK and perhaps I shouldn't take it
so seriously.
I tell him to fuck off.
10:15 After the fourth consecutive
"worst fucking
call I have EVER seen," I attempt to
remove my hat
again to begin beating inanimate
objects. However, on
this occasion I miscalculate and I
thumbnail myself in
my left eyelid, leaving a one-quarter
inch gash over
my eye. I am now bleeding into my left
eye and all
over my shirt. "Perhaps," I think to
myself, "I'm
taking this a bit seriously."
10:22 I am standing in the bathroom
peeing. I'm so
drunk I am swaying and grunting. I have
a bloody
napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants
are bloody.
I have my (formerly) white shirt
wrapped around my
waist. I look like I should be in an
episode of Cops.
10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody
white shirt
back on my body and make my way for the
exits. I am
stopped every 20 seconds by a good
samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me
why I am
covered in blood, but I merely grunt
incoherently and
keep moving.
10:59 With my one good eye, I have
located the
parking garage. I walk up six flights
of stairs,
promise that when I see my friend I
will punch him
in the face for making me walk up six
flights of
stairs, find the truck, and collapse in
a heap in the
bed of the truck. I look around and
notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around
the garage, six
whole flights, and no one is moving. I
take a nap.
11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my
friend in the
driver's seat. I lift my head to look
out the bed of
the truck and notice that traffic is
lined up all the
way around the garage, six whole
flights, and no one
is
moving. I am too tired to punch my
friend. I call my
friend a "Stupid fuck."
11:31 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a "Stupid fuck."

11:38 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a "Stupid fuck."

11:47 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a "Stupid fuck."

11:58 I am jostled. The truck is
moving. I lift my
head to look out the bed of the truck
and notice that
traffic is beginning to move on the
second floor. I
jump out of the truck, walk to the edge

I return to

12:26 We have emerged from the parking

my coma, "Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?"
Alas, the
answer is no, we were not winning and
we did not
score.
The largest (by far) cheer of the day
from the Texas
faithful occurred when the handlers
were walking back
to the tunnel and Bevo stopped to take
a gargantuan
shit all over the letters "S",
"K", and "A" in the
"Nebraska" spelled out in their end
zone. I cheer
wildly. I pick up the empty Traveler
bottle and stick
my tongue in it. I am thirsty.
6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as
I walk back
to the truck. I would taunt them with
some off-color
remarks about their parentage, but I am
too drunk to
form complete sentences. With my last
cognitive
thought of the evening, I take solace
in the fact that
if we had not beaten them in October,
they would be
playing Florida State for the national
championship.
6:30 Back in the car. On the way back
to Austin for
the 8:00 Texas-Arizona tip off. We can
still salvage
the day! I crack open a beer. It is
warm. I don't
care.
7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am
hungry. I go
inside the store. I walk past the beer
frig. I
notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I
wonder if
it's any good. I pull a Zima from the
frig. I twist
the top off and drink the Zima in three
swallows.
Zima
sucks. I replace the empty bottle in
the frig.
7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the
store. I walk to
where the ingredients are, where the
person usually
makes the sub. There is no one there. I
lean over
the counter and scoop out half a bucket
of black
olives. I eat them. I am still hungry.
I lean
further over the counter and grab
approximately two
pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the
store
grunting and eating Pastrami. The
patrons in the
store fear me. I don't care.
8:01 We are in South Austin. I have
been drinking
warm beer and singing Brooks and Dunn
tunes for over
an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my
singing. He
suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn
have written
other good songs besides "You're Going
to Miss Me When
I'm Gone" and "Neon Moon" and that
maybe listening to
only those two songs, ten times each
was a bit
excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I
could just let the
CD play on its own. I tell him to
fuck off and
restart "Neon Moon."
8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My
truckmate,
against my loud and profane
protestations, parks on
the top floor of a nearby parking
garage. I tell him
he's an idiot. I tell him we will never
get out. I
tell him we may as well pitch a
fucking tent here. He
ignores me. I think he's still pissed
about the
Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle "Neon
Moon" loudly.
8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers
stuffed in
my pants. We're going to kick the
shit out of
Arizona.
9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona
29. I am
pleased. I go to the bathroom to pee
for the 67th
time today. I giggle to myself because
of the
new opportunity to do "the bathroom
Brice." There are
no Arizona fans in the bathroom. I am
disappointed.
I tell myself (out loud) that I have a
"Niiiiiice
cock." No one is amused but me.
9:41 I walk to the bathroom while
drinking Bud Light
out of a can. Needless to say, they do
not sell beer
at the Erwin Center, much less Bud
Light out of a can.
I am stopped by an usher: "Where did
you get
that, sir?" I tell him (no shit):
"Oh, the
cheerleaders were throwing them up with
those little
plastic footballs. Would you mind
throwing this away
for me?" I take the last swig and hand
it to him. He
is confused. I pretend I'm going to the
bathroom, but
I run away giggling instead. I duck
into some
entrance to avoid the usher, who is now
pursuing me.
I sneak into a large group of people
and sit down.
The
usher walks by harmlessly. I am
giggling like a little
girl. I crack open another can of Bud
Light.
9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid
the usher, I
have lost my bearings. I have no ticket
stub. I
cannot find my seats. Texas is losing.
10:09 Texas is being screwed by the
refs. I am
enraged. I have cleared out the seats
around me
because I keep removing my hat and
beating the
surrounding chairs with it. A concerned
fan asks if
I'm OK and perhaps I shouldn't take it
so seriously.
I tell him to fuck off.
10:15 After the fourth consecutive
"worst fucking
call I have EVER seen," I attempt to
remove my hat
again to begin beating inanimate
objects. However, on
this occasion I miscalculate and I
thumbnail myself in
my left eyelid, leaving a one-quarter
inch gash over
my eye. I am now bleeding into my left
eye and all
over my shirt. "Perhaps," I think to
myself, "I'm
taking this a bit seriously."
10:22 I am standing in the bathroom
peeing. I'm so
drunk I am swaying and grunting. I have
a bloody
napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants
are bloody.
I have my (formerly) white shirt
wrapped around my
waist. I look like I should be in an
episode of Cops.
10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody
white shirt
back on my body and make my way for the
exits. I am
stopped every 20 seconds by a good
samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me
why I am
covered in blood, but I merely grunt
incoherently and
keep moving.
10:59 With my one good eye, I have
located the
parking garage. I walk up six flights
of stairs,
promise that when I see my friend I
will punch him
in the face for making me walk up six
flights of
stairs, find the truck, and collapse in
a heap in the
bed of the truck. I look around and
notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around
the garage, six
whole flights, and no one is moving. I
take a nap.
11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my
friend in the
driver's seat. I lift my head to look
out the bed of
the truck and notice that traffic is
lined up all the
way around the garage, six whole
flights, and no one
is
moving. I am too tired to punch my
friend. I call my
friend a "Stupid fuck."
11:31 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a "Stupid fuck."

11:38 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a "Stupid fuck."

11:47 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a "Stupid fuck."

11:58 I am jostled. The truck is
moving. I lift my
head to look out the bed of the truck
and notice that
traffic is beginning to move on the
second floor. I
jump out of the truck, walk to the edge
of the parking
facility, and pee off the sixth floor
onto the street
below. My friend looks at me like I
just anally
violated his minor sister. I turn
around and pee
on the front of his truck while singing
the lyrics
to "Neon Moon."
12:11 We are moving. We are out of
beer. I jump
from the truck and go from vehicle to
vehicle until
someone gives me two beers. I am happy.
I return to
my vehicle.
12:26 We have emerged from the parking
facility. We
make our way to my apartment and find
Ed sitting on
the couch with a freshly opened bottle
of Glenlivet on
the coffee table in front of him. We
are all going to
die tonight.
12:59 We have finished three-quarters
of the bottle
of Glenlivet. We decide it would be a
wonderful idea
to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has
to pee. He
walks down the hall to our apartment
and directly into
the full length mirror at the end of
the hall,
smashing it into hundreds of pieces. We
giggle
uncontrollably and leave for
PollyEsther's.
1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs
uncontrollably
at our efforts to enter his club.
"Fellas," he says
in between his fits of spastic
laughter, "I've been
working this door for almost a year.
I've been
working
doors in this town for almost 5 years.
And I can
honestly say that I ain't never seen
three drunker
mother fuckers than you three.
Sorry, can't let you
in." We attempt to reason with him. He
laughs
harder.
1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We
take two
steps in the door and hear "Last call
for alcohol!" I
turn to the group and mutter: "See, dat
wasn't that
fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that
at the
Awamo...the awaom...the
alab...fuck it, that stadium
we
was at today..." We order 6 shots of
tequila and
three beers.
2:15 Back on the street. We need food.
We hail a
cab to take us the two and one half
blocks to Katz's.
The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10
and tell him
to keep it.
2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give
the hostess
$50. We are seated immediately.
2:25 We order two orders of fried
pickles, a Cobb
salad, a bowl of soup, two orders of
Blueberry
blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a
hamburger, two
cheese stuffed potatoes, an order of
fries, and an
order of onion rings.
2:39 The food arrives. We are all
asleep with our
heads on the table. The waiter wakes us
up. We eat
every fucking bit of our food. Most
of the restaurant
patrons around us are disgusted. We
don't give a
shit.
The tab is $112 with tip.
2:46 I'm sleepy.
9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman.
She is the
bartender at Katz's. She is not pretty.

this is an old one but a great one.
If you dont like this email, then you just don't understand.



A chronology of events for Saturday,  December 4, 1999,
and the early morning hours of Sunday,
December 5, 1999:
6:00 Arise, play the Eyes of Texas and
Texas Fight at
full-freaking blast
6:20 Get in car, drive to New Braunfels

7:30 Tee off (me and a buddy were the
FIRST tee-time
of the morning)
8:50 Turn 9 (crack open first beer)
8:53 Crack open second beer
8:58 Crack open...(you get the idea)
10:30 Finish 18 (holes, as well as
beers), sign
scorecard for smoooooth 95
10:35 Headed for San Antonio
10:50 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and
post-game
festivities
11:10 We decide we don't have enough
booze, so we
double-back to a liquor store and buy
the good ol' 750
ml plastic bottle "Traveler" Jim Beam
11:50 Arrive at the tailgate spot.
Awesome day. Not
a single cloud in the sky. About 70
degrees.
11:55 I decide that we're going to kick
the shit out
of Nebraska.
11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to
go fuck
himself.
12:15 The UT band walks by on the way
to the
Alamodome. We're on the second floor of
a two-story
parking garage on the corner (a couple
hundred of us).
We're hooting and hollering like
wildmen. The band
doubles back to the street right below
us and
serenades us with Texas Fight and The
Eyes of Texas.
AWESOME MOMENT.
12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity,
50-100 grown
men are bumping chests with one
another, each and
every one of them now secure and
certain of the fact
that we are going to kick the
shit out of Nebraska.
1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the
way to the
Alamodome. Again, we hoot and holler
like wildmen.
Again, the band doubles back and stops
right below us
to serenade us, this time, however,
with the Nebraska
fight songs. Although somewhat
impressed by their
spirit and verve, we remain convinced
that we are
going to kick the shit out of
Nebraska.
1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome,
somehow
managing to stuff the "Traveler" and 11
cans of beer
into my pants.
1:47 I am in line surrounded by
Nebraska fans. They
are taunting me. I am taunting back,
still certain
that we are going to kick the
shit out of Nebraska. I
decide to challenge a particularly
vocal Nebraska fan
to play what I now call and will
forever be remembered
as "Cell-Phone Flop Out." Remember flop
out for a
dollar? The rules are similar. I tell
this Nebraska
jackass that if he's so confident in
his team, he
should "flop out" his cell phone RIGHT
NOW and make
plane reservations to Phoenix for the
Fiesta Bowl.
And then I spoke these memorable words:
"And not
those
damn refundable tickets, either! You
request those
non-refundable, non-transferrable
sons-of-bitches!"
He backs down. He is unworthy. I call
Southwest
Airlines and buy two tickets to
Phoenix,
non-refundable
and non-transferrable. Price: $712. He
is humbled.
He lowers his head in shame. I raise my
cell phone in
triumph to the cheers of hundreds of
Texas fans. I am
KING and these are my subjects. I
distribute the 11
beers in my pants to the cheering
masses. I RULE the
pre-game kingdom.
2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence,
I open the
Traveler and pour my first stiffy.
2:45 I notice something troubling:
Nebraska is big.
Nebraska is fast. Nebraska is very
pissed off at
Texas.
3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends.
9 yards
total offense for Texas. Zero first
downs for Texas.
I'm still talking shit. I pour
another stiffy from
the Traveler.
3:36 Four minutes to go in the first
half: the
Traveler is a dead soldier. I buy my
first $5 beer
from the Alamodome merchants. While I
am standing in
line, a center snap nearly decapitates
Major
Applewhite
and rolls out of the end zone. Safety.
3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas
0. I wish I
had another Traveler.
4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska
fan in the
bathroom at halftime, I attempt to
revive the classic
Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:
"Hey, buddy,
niiiiiiiiice cock." He is
unamused.
4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from
the Alamodome
merchants. I share my beer with two
high school girls
sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they
are equipped
with a flask full of vodka. I send them
off to
purchase $5 Sprites, so that we may
consume their
vodka. I have not lost faith. Nebraska
is a bunch of
pussies.
4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting
behind me have
fled for their lives. I purchase two
more $5 beers
from the Alamodome merchants.
5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I
am beginning
to lose faith. This normally would
trouble me, but I
am too drunk to see the football field.

5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: "I'm
sorry, sir.
Those tickets have been confirmed and
are
non-refundable and non-transferrable."
5:37 I try to start a fight with every
person behind
the concession counter. As it turns
out, the
Alamodome has a policy that no beer can
be sold when
there is less than 10 minutes on the
game clock. I am
enraged by this policy. I ask loudly:
"Why the fuck
didn't you announce last call over the
fucking PA
system??!!"
5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in
my chair in
defeat. All of a sudden, the Texas
crowd goes
absolutely nuts. "Whazzis?," I mutter,
awaking from
my coma, "Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?"
Alas, the
answer is no, we were not winning and
we did not
score.
The largest (by far) cheer of the day
from the Texas
faithful occurred when the handlers
were walking back
to the tunnel and Bevo stopped to take
a gargantuan
shit all over the letters "S",
"K", and "A" in the
"Nebraska" spelled out in their end
zone. I cheer
wildly. I pick up the empty Traveler
bottle and stick
my tongue in it. I am thirsty.
6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as
I walk back
to the truck. I would taunt them with
some off-color
remarks about their parentage, but I am
too drunk to
form complete sentences. With my last
cognitive
thought of the evening, I take solace
in the fact that
if we had not beaten them in October,
they would be
playing Florida State for the national
championship.
6:30 Back in the car. On the way back
to Austin for
the 8:00 Texas-Arizona tip off. We can
still salvage
the day! I crack open a beer. It is
warm. I don't
care.
7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am
hungry. I go
inside the store. I walk past the beer
frig. I
notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I
wonder if
it's any good. I pull a Zima from the
frig. I twist
the top off and drink the Zima in three
swallows.
Zima
sucks. I replace the empty bottle in
the frig.
7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the
store. I walk to
where the ingredients are, where the
person usually
makes the sub. There is no one there. I
lean over
the counter and scoop out half a bucket
of black
olives. I eat them. I am still hungry.
I lean
further over the counter and grab
approximately two
pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the
store
grunting and eating Pastrami. The
patrons in the
store fear me. I don't care.
8:01 We are in South Austin. I have
been drinking
warm beer and singing Brooks and Dunn
tunes for over
an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my
singing. He
suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn
have written
other good songs besides "You're Going
to Miss Me When
I'm Gone" and "Neon Moon" and that
maybe listening to
only those two songs, ten times each
was a bit
excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I
could just let the
CD play on its own. I tell him to
fuck off and
restart "Neon Moon."
8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My
truckmate,
against my loud and profane
protestations, parks on
the top floor of a nearby parking
garage. I tell him
he's an idiot. I tell him we will never
get out. I
tell him we may as well pitch a
fucking tent here. He
ignores me. I think he's still pissed
about the
Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle "Neon
Moon" loudly.
8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers
stuffed in
my pants. We're going to kick the
shit out of
Arizona.
9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona
29. I am
pleased. I go to the bathroom to pee
for the 67th
time today. I giggle to myself because
of the
new opportunity to do "the bathroom
Brice." There are
no Arizona fans in the bathroom. I am
disappointed.
I tell myself (out loud) that I have a
"Niiiiiice
cock." No one is amused but me.
9:41 I walk to the bathroom while
drinking Bud Light
out of a can. Needless to say, they do
not sell beer
at the Erwin Center, much less Bud
Light out of a can.
I am stopped by an usher: "Where did
you get
that, sir?" I tell him (no shit):
"Oh, the
cheerleaders were throwing them up with
those little
plastic footballs. Would you mind
throwing this away
for me?" I take the last swig and hand
it to him. He
is confused. I pretend I'm going to the
bathroom, but
I run away giggling instead. I duck
into some
entrance to avoid the usher, who is now
pursuing me.
I sneak into a large group of people
and sit down.
The
usher walks by harmlessly. I am
giggling like a little
girl. I crack open another can of Bud
Light.
9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid
the usher, I
have lost my bearings. I have no ticket
stub. I
cannot find my seats. Texas is losing.
10:09 Texas is being screwed by the
refs. I am
enraged. I have cleared out the seats
around me
because I keep removing my hat and
beating the
surrounding chairs with it. A concerned
fan asks if
I'm OK and perhaps I shouldn't take it
so seriously.
I tell him to fuck off.
10:15 After the fourth consecutive
"worst fucking
call I have EVER seen," I attempt to
remove my hat
again to begin beating inanimate
objects. However, on
this occasion I miscalculate and I
thumbnail myself in
my left eyelid, leaving a one-quarter
inch gash over
my eye. I am now bleeding into my left
eye and all
over my shirt. "Perhaps," I think to
myself, "I'm
taking this a bit seriously."
10:22 I am standing in the bathroom
peeing. I'm so
drunk I am swaying and grunting. I have
a bloody
napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants
are bloody.
I have my (formerly) white shirt
wrapped around my
waist. I look like I should be in an
episode of Cops.
10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody
white shirt
back on my body and make my way for the
exits. I am
stopped every 20 seconds by a good
samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me
why I am
covered in blood, but I merely grunt
incoherently and
keep moving.
10:59 With my one good eye, I have
located the
parking garage. I walk up six flights
of stairs,
promise that when I see my friend I
will punch him
in the face for making me walk up six
flights of
stairs, find the truck, and collapse in
a heap in the
bed of the truck. I look around and
notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around
the garage, six
whole flights, and no one is moving. I
take a nap.
11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my
friend in the
driver's seat. I lift my head to look
out the bed of
the truck and notice that traffic is
lined up all the
way around the garage, six whole
flights, and no one
is
moving. I am too tired to punch my
friend. I call my
friend a "Stupid fuck."
11:31 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a "Stupid fuck."

11:38 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a "Stupid fuck."

11:47 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a "Stupid fuck."

11:58 I am jostled. The truck is
moving. I lift my
head to look out the bed of the truck
and notice that
traffic is beginning to move on the
second floor. I
jump out of the truck, walk to the edge
of the parking
facility, and pee off the sixth floor
onto the street
below. My friend looks at me like I
just anally
violated his minor sister. I turn
around and pee
on the front of his truck while singing
the lyrics
to "Neon Moon."
12:11 We are moving. We are out of
beer. I jump
from the truck and go from vehicle to
vehicle until
someone gives me two beers. I am happy.
I return to
my vehicle.
12:26 We have emerged from the parking
facility. We
make our way to my apartment and find
Ed sitting on
the couch with a freshly opened bottle
of Glenlivet on
the coffee table in front of him. We
are all going to
die tonight.
12:59 We have finished three-quarters
of the bottle
of Glenlivet. We decide it would be a
wonderful idea
to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has
to pee. He
walks down the hall to our apartment
and directly into
the full length mirror at the end of
the hall,
smashing it into hundreds of pieces. We
giggle
uncontrollably and leave for
PollyEsther's.
1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs
uncontrollably
at our efforts to enter his club.
"Fellas," he says
in between his fits of spastic
laughter, "I've been
working this door for almost a year.
I've been
working
doors in this town for almost 5 years.
And I can
honestly say that I ain't never seen
three drunker
mother fuckers than you three.
Sorry, can't let you
in." We attempt to reason with him. He
laughs
harder.
1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We
take two
steps in the door and hear "Last call
for alcohol!" I
turn to the group and mutter: "See, dat
wasn't that
fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that
at the
Awamo...the awaom...the
alab...fuck it, that stadium
we
was at today..." We order 6 shots of
tequila and
three beers.
2:15 Back on the street. We need food.
We hail a
cab to take us the two and one half
blocks to Katz's.
The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10
and tell him
to keep it.
2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give
the hostess
$50. We are seated immediately.
2:25 We order two orders of fried
pickles, a Cobb
salad, a bowl of soup, two orders of
Blueberry
blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a
hamburger, two
cheese stuffed potatoes, an order of
fries, and an
order of onion rings.
2:39 The food arrives. We are all
asleep with our
heads on the table. The waiter wakes us
up. We eat
every fucking bit of our food. Most
of the restaurant
patrons around us are disgusted. We
don't give a
shit.
The tab is $112 with tip.
2:46 I'm sleepy.
9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman.
She is the
bartender at Katz's. She is not pretty.

this is an old one but a great one.
If you dont like this email, then you just don't understand.



A chronology of events for Saturday,  December 4, 1999,
and the early morning hours of Sunday,
December 5, 1999:
6:00 Arise, play the Eyes of Texas and
Texas Fight at
full-freaking blast
6:20 Get in car, drive to New Braunfels

7:30 Tee off (me and a buddy were the
FIRST tee-time
of the morning)
8:50 Turn 9 (crack open first beer)
8:53 Crack open second beer
8:58 Crack open...(you get the idea)
10:30 Finish 18 (holes, as well as
beers), sign
scorecard for smoooooth 95
10:35 Headed for San Antonio
10:50 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and
post-game
festivities
11:10 We decide we don't have enough
booze, so we
double-back to a liquor store and buy
the good ol' 750
ml plastic bottle "Traveler" Jim Beam
11:50 Arrive at the tailgate spot.
Awesome day. Not
a single cloud in the sky. About 70
degrees.
11:55 I decide that we're going to kick
the shit out
of Nebraska.
11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to
go fuck
himself.
12:15 The UT band walks by on the way
to the
Alamodome. We're on the second floor of
a two-story
parking garage on the corner (a couple
hundred of us).
We're hooting and hollering like
wildmen. The band
doubles back to the street right below
us and
serenades us with Texas Fight and The
Eyes of Texas.
AWESOME MOMENT.
12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity,
50-100 grown
men are bumping chests with one
another, each and
every one of them now secure and
certain of the fact
that we are going to kick the
shit out of Nebraska.
1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the
way to the
Alamodome. Again, we hoot and holler
like wildmen.
Again, the band doubles back and stops
right below us
to serenade us, this time, however,
with the Nebraska
fight songs. Although somewhat
impressed by their
spirit and verve, we remain convinced
that we are
going to kick the shit out of
Nebraska.
1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome,
somehow
managing to stuff the "Traveler" and 11
cans of beer
into my pants.
1:47 I am in line surrounded by
Nebraska fans. They
are taunting me. I am taunting back,
still certain
that we are going to kick the
shit out of Nebraska. I
decide to challenge a particularly
vocal Nebraska fan
to play what I now call and will
forever be remembered
as "Cell-Phone Flop Out." Remember flop
out for a
dollar? The rules are similar. I tell
this Nebraska
jackass that if he's so confident in
his team, he
should "flop out" his cell phone RIGHT
NOW and make
plane reservations to Phoenix for the
Fiesta Bowl.
And then I spoke these memorable words:
"And not
those
damn refundable tickets, either! You
request those
non-refundable, non-transferrable
sons-of-bitches!"
He backs down. He is unworthy. I call
Southwest
Airlines and buy two tickets to
Phoenix,
non-refundable
and non-transferrable. Price: $712. He
is humbled.
He lowers his head in shame. I raise my
cell phone in
triumph to the cheers of hundreds of
Texas fans. I am
KING and these are my subjects. I
distribute the 11
beers in my pants to the cheering
masses. I RULE the
pre-game kingdom.
2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence,
I open the
Traveler and pour my first stiffy.
2:45 I notice something troubling:
Nebraska is big.
Nebraska is fast. Nebraska is very
pissed off at
Texas.
3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends.
9 yards
total offense for Texas. Zero first
downs for Texas.
I'm still talking shit. I pour
another stiffy from
the Traveler.
3:36 Four minutes to go in the first
half: the
Traveler is a dead soldier. I buy my
first $5 beer
from the Alamodome merchants. While I
am standing in
line, a center snap nearly decapitates
Major
Applewhite
and rolls out of the end zone. Safety.
3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas
0. I wish I
had another Traveler.
4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska
fan in the
bathroom at halftime, I attempt to
revive the classic
Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:
"Hey, buddy,
niiiiiiiiice cock." He is
unamused.
4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from
the Alamodome
merchants. I share my beer with two
high school girls
sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they
are equipped
with a flask full of vodka. I send them
off to
purchase $5 Sprites, so that we may
consume their
vodka. I have not lost faith. Nebraska
is a bunch of
pussies.
4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting
behind me have
fled for their lives. I purchase two
more $5 beers
from the Alamodome merchants.
5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I
am beginning
to lose faith. This normally would
trouble me, but I
am too drunk to see the football field.

5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: "I'm
sorry, sir.
Those tickets have been confirmed and
are
non-refundable and non-transferrable."
5:37 I try to start a fight with every
person behind
the concession counter. As it turns
out, the
Alamodome has a policy that no beer can
be sold when
there is less than 10 minutes on the
game clock. I am
enraged by this policy. I ask loudly:
"Why the fuck
didn't you announce last call over the
fucking PA
system??!!"
5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in
my chair in
defeat. All of a sudden, the Texas
crowd goes
absolutely nuts. "Whazzis?," I mutter,
awaking from
my coma, "Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?"
Alas, the
answer is no, we were not winning and
we did not
score.
The largest (by far) cheer of the day
from the Texas
faithful occurred when the handlers
were walking back
to the tunnel and Bevo stopped to take
a gargantuan
shit all over the letters "S",
"K", and "A" in the
"Nebraska" spelled out in their end
zone. I cheer
wildly. I pick up the empty Traveler
bottle and stick
my tongue in it. I am thirsty.
6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as
I walk back
to the truck. I would taunt them with
some off-color
remarks about their parentage, but I am
too drunk to
form complete sentences. With my last
cognitive
thought of the evening, I take solace
in the fact that
if we had not beaten them in October,
they would be
playing Florida State for the national
championship.
6:30 Back in the car. On the way back
to Austin for
the 8:00 Texas-Arizona tip off. We can
still salvage
the day! I crack open a beer. It is
warm. I don't
care.
7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am
hungry. I go
inside the store. I walk past the beer
frig. I
notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I
wonder if
it's any good. I pull a Zima from the
frig. I twist
the top off and drink the Zima in three
swallows.
Zima
sucks. I replace the empty bottle in
the frig.
7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the
store. I walk to
where the ingredients are, where the
person usually
makes the sub. There is no one there. I
lean over
the counter and scoop out half a bucket
of black
olives. I eat them. I am still hungry.
I lean
further over the counter and grab
approximately two
pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the
store
grunting and eating Pastrami. The
patrons in the
store fear me. I don't care.
8:01 We are in South Austin. I have
been drinking
warm beer and singing Brooks and Dunn
tunes for over
an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my
singing. He
suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn
have written
other good songs besides "You're Going
to Miss Me When
I'm Gone" and "Neon Moon" and that
maybe listening to
only those two songs, ten times each
was a bit
excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I
could just let the
CD play on its own. I tell him to
fuck off and
restart "Neon Moon."
8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My
truckmate,
against my loud and profane
protestations, parks on
the top floor of a nearby parking
garage. I tell him
he's an idiot. I tell him we will never
get out. I
tell him we may as well pitch a
fucking tent here. He
ignores me. I think he's still pissed
about the
Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle "Neon
Moon" loudly.
8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers
stuffed in
my pants. We're going to kick the
shit out of
Arizona.
9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona
29. I am
pleased. I go to the bathroom to pee
for the 67th
time today. I giggle to myself because
of the
new opportunity to do "the bathroom
Brice." There are
no Arizona fans in the bathroom. I am
disappointed.
I tell myself (out loud) that I have a
"Niiiiiice
cock." No one is amused but me.
9:41 I walk to the bathroom while
drinking Bud Light
out of a can. Needless to say, they do
not sell beer
at the Erwin Center, much less Bud
Light out of a can.
I am stopped by an usher: "Where did
you get
that, sir?" I tell him (no shit):
"Oh, the
cheerleaders were throwing them up with
those little
plastic footballs. Would you mind
throwing this away
for me?" I take the last swig and hand
it to him. He
is confused. I pretend I'm going to the
bathroom, but
I run away giggling instead. I duck
into some
entrance to avoid the usher, who is now
pursuing me.
I sneak into a large group of people
and sit down.
The
usher walks by harmlessly. I am
giggling like a little
girl. I crack open another can of Bud
Light.
9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid
the usher, I
have lost my bearings. I have no ticket
stub. I
cannot find my seats. Texas is losing.
10:09 Texas is being screwed by the
refs. I am
enraged. I have cleared out the seats
around me
because I keep removing my hat and
beating the
surrounding chairs with it. A concerned
fan asks if
I'm OK and perhaps I shouldn't take it
so seriously.
I tell him to fuck off.
10:15 After the fourth consecutive
"worst fucking
call I have EVER seen," I attempt to
remove my hat
again to begin beating inanimate
objects. However, on
this occasion I miscalculate and I
thumbnail myself in
my left eyelid, leaving a one-quarter
inch gash over
my eye. I am now bleeding into my left
eye and all
over my shirt. "Perhaps," I think to
myself, "I'm
taking this a bit seriously."
10:22 I am standing in the bathroom
peeing. I'm so
drunk I am swaying and grunting. I have
a bloody
napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants
are bloody.
I have my (formerly) white shirt
wrapped around my
waist. I look like I should be in an
episode of Cops.
10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody
white shirt
back on my body and make my way for the
exits. I am
stopped every 20 seconds by a good
samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me
why I am
covered in blood, but I merely grunt
incoherently and
keep moving.
10:59 With my one good eye, I have
located the
parking garage. I walk up six flights
of stairs,
promise that when I see my friend I
will punch him
in the face for making me walk up six
flights of
stairs, find the truck, and collapse in
a heap in the
bed of the truck. I look around and
notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around
the garage, six
whole flights, and no one is moving. I
take a nap.
11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my
friend in the
driver's seat. I lift my head to look
out the bed of
the truck and notice that traffic is
lined up all the
way around the garage, six whole
flights, and no one
is
moving. I am too tired to punch my
friend. I call my
friend a "Stupid fuck."
11:31 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a "Stupid fuck."

11:38 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a "Stupid fuck."

11:47 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a "Stupid fuck."

11:58 I am jostled. The truck is
moving. I lift my
head to look out the bed of the truck
and notice that
traffic is beginning to move on the
second floor. I
jump out of the truck, walk to the edge
of the parking
facility, and pee off the sixth floor
onto the street
below. My friend looks at me like I
just anally
violated his minor sister. I turn
around and pee
on the front of his truck while singing
the lyrics
to "Neon Moon."
12:11 We are moving. We are out of
beer. I jump
from the truck and go from vehicle to
vehicle until
someone gives me two beers. I am happy.
I return to
my vehicle.
12:26 We have emerged from the parking
facility. We
make our way to my apartment and find
Ed sitting on
the couch with a freshly opened bottle
of Glenlivet on
the coffee table in front of him. We
are all going to
die tonight.
12:59 We have finished three-quarters
of the bottle
of Glenlivet. We decide it would be a
wonderful idea
to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has
to pee. He
walks down the hall to our apartment
and directly into
the full length mirror at the end of
the hall,
smashing it into hundreds of pieces. We
giggle
uncontrollably and leave for
PollyEsther's.
1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs
uncontrollably
at our efforts to enter his club.
"Fellas," he says
in between his fits of spastic
laughter, "I've been
working this door for almost a year.
I've been
working
doors in this town for almost 5 years.
And I can
honestly say that I ain't never seen
three drunker
mother fuckers than you three.
Sorry, can't let you
in." We attempt to reason with him. He
laughs
harder.
1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We
take two
steps in the door and hear "Last call
for alcohol!" I
turn to the group and mutter: "See, dat
wasn't that
fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that
at the
Awamo...the awaom...the
alab...fuck it, that stadium
we
was at today..." We order 6 shots of
tequila and
three beers.
2:15 Back on the street. We need food.
We hail a
cab to take us the two and one half
blocks to Katz's.
The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10
and tell him
to keep it.
2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give
the hostess
$50. We are seated immediately.
2:25 We order two orders of fried
pickles, a Cobb
salad, a bowl of soup, two orders of
Blueberry
blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a
hamburger, two
cheese stuffed potatoes, an order of
fries, and an
order of onion rings.
2:39 The food arrives. We are all
asleep with our
heads on the table. The waiter wakes us
up. We eat
every fucking bit of our food. Most
of the restaurant
patrons around us are disgusted. We
don't give a
shit.
The tab is $112 with tip.
2:46 I'm sleepy.
9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman.
She is the
bartender at Katz's. She is not pretty.

> > A chronology of events for Saturday, December 4, 1999, and the early
morning
hours of Sunday, December 5, 1999:
6:00 Arise, play the Eyes of Texas and Texas Fight at full-freaking blast
6:20 Get in car, drive to New Braunfels
7:30 Tee off (me and a buddy were the FIRST tee-time of the morning)
8:50 Turn 9 (crack open first beer)
8:53 Crack open second beer
8:58 Crack open...(you get the idea)
10:30 Finish 18 (holes, as well as beers), sign scorecard for smoooooth 95
10:35 Headed for San Antonio
10:50 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and post-game festivities
11:10 We decide we don't have enough booze, so we double-back to a liquor
store and buy the good ol' 750 ml plastic bottle "Traveler" Jim Beam
11:50 Arrive at the tailgate spot. Awesome day. Not a single cloud in the
sky. About 70 degrees.
11:55 I decide that we're going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to go fuck himself.
12:15 The UT band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. We're on the second
floor of a two-story parking garage on the corner (a couple hundred of us).
We're hooting and hollering like wildmen. The band doubles back to the
street right below us and serenades us with Texas Fight and The Eyes of
Texas. AWESOME MOMENT.
12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity, 50-100 grown men are bumping chests
with one another, each and every one of them now secure and certain of the
fact that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. Again, we hoot
and holler like wildmen. Again, the band doubles back and stops right below
us to serenade us, this time, however, with the Nebraska fight songs.
*Although somewhat impressed by their spirit and verve, we remain convinced
that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome, somehow managing to stuff the
"Traveler" and 11 cans of beer into my pants.
1:47 I am in line surrounded by Nebraska fans. They are taunting me. I am
taunting back, still certain that we are going to kick the shit out of
Nebraska. I decide to challenge a particularly vocal Nebraska fan to play
 what I now call and will forever be remembered as "Cell-Phone Flop Out."
Remember flop out for a dollar? The rules are similar. I tell this Nebraska
jackass that if he's so confident in his team, he should "flop out" his cell
 phone RIGHT NOW and make plane reservations to Phoenix for the Fiesta
Bowl.
 And then I spoke these memorable words: "And not those damn refundable
tickets, either! You request those non-refundable, non-transferrable
sons-of-bitches!" He backs down. He is unworthy. I call Southwest Airlines
and buy two tickets to Phoenix, non-refundable and non-transferrable. Price:
 $712. He is humbled. He lowers his head in shame. I raise my cell phone in
 triumph to the cheers of hundreds of Texas fans. I am KING and these are my
 subjects. I distribute the 11 beers in my pants to the cheering masses. I
 RULE the pre-game kingdom.
2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence, I open the Traveler and pour my
first stiffy.
2:45 I notice something troubling: Nebraska is big. Nebraska is fast.
Nebraska is very pissed off at Texas.
3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends. 9 yards total offense for Texas.
Zero first downs for Texas. I'm still talking shit. I pour another stiffy
 from the Traveler.
3:36 Four minutes to go in the first half: the Traveler is a dead soldier.

I buy my first $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. While I am standing in
line, a center snap nearly decapitates Major Applewhite and rolls out of the
end zone. Safety.
3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas 0. I wish I had another Traveler.
4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska fan in the bathroom at halftime, I
attempt to revive the classic Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:
"Hey, buddy, niiiiiiiiice cock." He is unamused.
4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. I share my
beer with two high school girls sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they are
equipped with a flask full of vodka. I send them off to purchase Sprites, so
that we may consume their vodka. I have not lost faith.  Nebraska is a bunch
of pussies.
4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting behind me have fled for their lives.

I purchase two more $5 beers from the Alamodome merchants.
5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I am beginning to lose faith. This
normally would trouble me, but I am too drunk to see the football field.
5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: "I'm sorry, sir. Those tickets have been
confirmed and are non-refundable and non-transferrable."
5:37 I try to start a fight with every person behind the concession counter.
As it turns out, the Alamodome has a policy that no beer can be sold when
there is less than 10 minutes on the game clock. I am enraged by this
policy. I ask loudly: "Why the fuck didn't you announce last call over the
fucking PA system??!!"
5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in my chair in defeat. All of a sudden,
the Texas crowd goes absolutely nuts. "Whazzis?," I mutter, awaking from my
coma, "Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?" Alas, the answer is no, we were not
winning and we did not score. The largest (by far) cheer of the day from
the
Texas faithful occurred when the handlers were walking back to the tunnel
and Bevo stopped to take a gargantuan shit all over the letters "S", "K",
and "A" in the "Nebraska" spelled out in their end zone.  I cheer wildly.

I pick up the empty Traveler bottle and stick my tongue in it. I am thirsty.
6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as I walk back to the truck. I would
taunt them with some off-color remarks about their parentage, but I am too
drunk to form complete sentences. With my last cognitive thought of the
evening, I take solace in the fact that if we had not beaten them in
October, they would be playing Florida State for the national
championship.
6:30 Back in the car. On the way back to Austin for the 8:00 Texas-Arizona
tip off. We can still salvage the day! I crack open a beer.  *It is warm.

I don't care.
7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am hungry. I go inside the store. I walk
past the beer frig. I notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I wonder if it's
any good. I pull a Zima from the frig. I twist the top off and drink the
Zima in three swallows. Zima sucks. I replace the empty bottle in the frig.
7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the store. I walk to where the ingredients
are, where the person usually makes the sub. There is no one there. I lean
over the counter and scoop out half a bucket of black olives. I eat them.

I am still hungry. I lean further over the counter and grab approximately
two
pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the store grunting and eating Pastrami.
The patrons in the store fear me. I don't care.
8:01 We are in South Austin. I have been drinking warm beer and singing
Brooks and Dunn tunes for over an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my
singing. He suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn have written other good
songs besides "You're Going to Miss Me When I'm Gone" and "Neon Moon" and
that maybe listening to only those two songs, ten times each was a bit
excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I could just let the CD play on its own.

I tell him to fuck off and restart "Neon Moon."
8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My truckmate, against my loud and
profane protestations, parks on the top floor of a nearby parking garage.

I
tell him he's an idiot. I tell him we will never get out. I tell him we may
as well pitch a fucking tent here. He ignores me. I think he's still pissed
about the Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle "Neon Moon" loudly.
8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers stuffed in my pants. We're going to
kick the shit out of Arizona.
9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona 29. I am pleased. I go to the
bathroom to pee for the 67th time today. I giggle to myself because of the
new opportunity to do "the bathroom Brice." There are no Arizona fans in the
bathroom. I am disappointed. I tell myself (out loud) that I have a
"Niiiiiice cock." No one is amused but me.
9:41 I walk to the bathroom while drinking Bud Light out of a can.  Needless
to say, they do not sell beer at the Erwin Center,much less Bud Light out

of
a can. I am stopped by an usher: "Where did you get that, sir?" I tell him
(no shit): "Oh, the cheerleaders were throwing them up with those little
plastic footballs. Would you mind throwing this away for me?" I take the
last swig and hand it to him. He is confused. I pretend I'm going to the
bathroom, but I run away giggling instead. I duck into some entrance to
avoid the usher, who is now pursuing me. I sneak into a large group of
people and sit down. The usher walks by harmlessly. I am giggling like a
little girl. I crack open another can of Bud Light.
9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid the usher, I have lostmy bearings. I
have no ticket stub. I cannot find my seats. Texas is losing.
10:09 Texas is being screwed by the refs. I am enraged. I have cleared out
the seats around me because I keep removing my hat and beating the
surrounding chairs with it. A concerned fan asks if I'm OK and perhaps I
shouldn't take it so seriously. I tell him to fuck off.
10:15 After the fourth consecutive "worst fucking call I have EVER seen," I
attempt to remove my hat again to begin beating inanimate objects.  However,
on this occasion I miscalculate and I thumbnail myself in my left eyelid,
leaving a one-quarter inch gash over my eye. I am now bleeding into my left
eye and all over my shirt. "Perhaps," I think to myself, "I'm taking this a
bit seriously."
10:22 I am standing in the bathroom peeing. I'm so drunk I am swaying and
grunting. I have a bloody napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants are
bloody. I have my (formerly) white shirt wrapped around my waist. I look
like I should be in an episode of Cops.
10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody white shirt back on my body and make
my way for the exits. I am stopped every 20 seconds by a good
samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me why I am covered in blood, but I
merely grunt incoherently and keep moving.
10:59 With my one good eye, I have located the parking garage. I walk up six
flights of stairs, promise that when I see my friend I will punch him in the
face for making me walk up six flights of stairs, find the truck, and
collapse in a heap in the bed of the truck. I look around and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and

no one is moving. I take a nap.
11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my friend in the driver's seat. I lift my
head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up
all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving.  I
am too tired to punch my friend. I call my friend a "Stupid cocksucker."
11:31 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving. I call my friend a "Stupid cocksucker."
11:38 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving. I call my friend a "Stupid cocksucker."
11:47 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and

no one is moving. I call my friend a "Stupid cocksucker."
11:58 I am jostled. The truck is moving. I lift my head to look out the bed
of the truck and notice that traffic is beginning to move on the second
floor. I jump out of the truck, walk to the edge of the parking facility,
and pee off the sixth floor onto the street below. My friend looks at me
like I just anally violated his minor sister. I turn around and pee on the
front of his truck while singing the lyrics to "Neon Moon."
12:11 We are moving. We are out of beer. I jump from the truck and go from
vehicle to vehicle until someone gives me two beers. I am happy. I return to
my vehicle.
12:26 We have emerged from the parking facility. We make our way to my
apartment and find Ed sitting on the couch with a freshly opened bottle of
Glenlivet on the coffee table in front of him. We are all going to die
tonight.
12:59 We have finished three-quarters of the bottle of Glenlivet. We decide
it would be a wonderful idea to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has to pee.
He walks down the hall to our apartment and directly into the full length
 mirror at the end of the hall, smashing it into hundreds of pieces.  We
giggle uncontrollably and leave for PollyEsther's.
1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs uncontrollably at our efforts to enter
his club. "Fellas," he says in between his fits of spastic laughter, "I've
 been working this door for almost a year. I've been working doors in this
town for almost 5 years. And I can honestly say that I ain't never seen
three drunker mother fuckers than you three. Sorry, can't let you in." We
attempt to reason with him. He laughs harder.
1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We take two steps in the door and hear
"Last call for alcohol!" I turn to the group and mutter: "See, dat wasn't
that fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that at the Awamo...the awaom...the
alab...fuck it, that stadium we was at today..." We order 6 shots of tequila
and three beers.
2:15 Back on the street. We need food. We hail a cab to take us the two and
one half blocks to Katz's. The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10 and tell
him to keep it.
2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give the hostess $50. We are seated
immediately.
2:25 We order two orders of fried pickles, a Cobb salad, a bowl of soup, two
orders of Blueberry blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a hamburger, two cheese
stuffed potatoes, an order of fries, and an order of onion rings.
2:39 The food arrives. We are all asleep with our heads onthe table. The
waiter wakes us up. We eat every fucking bit of our food. Most of the
restaurant patrons around us are disgusted. We don't give a fuck. The tab is
$112 with tip.
2:46 I'm sleepy.
9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman. She is the bartender at Katz's.
She is not pretty.

> > A chronology of events for Saturday, December 4, 1999, and the early
morning
hours of Sunday, December 5, 1999:
6:00 Arise, play the Eyes of Texas and Texas Fight at full-freaking blast
6:20 Get in car, drive to New Braunfels
7:30 Tee off (me and a buddy were the FIRST tee-time of the morning)
8:50 Turn 9 (crack open first beer)
8:53 Crack open second beer
8:58 Crack open...(you get the idea)
10:30 Finish 18 (holes, as well as beers), sign scorecard for smoooooth 95
10:35 Headed for San Antonio
10:50 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and post-game festivities
11:10 We decide we don't have enough booze, so we double-back to a liquor
store and buy the good ol' 750 ml plastic bottle "Traveler" Jim Beam
11:50 Arrive at the tailgate spot. Awesome day. Not a single cloud in the
sky. About 70 degrees.
11:55 I decide that we're going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to go fuck himself.
12:15 The UT band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. We're on the second
floor of a two-story parking garage on the corner (a couple hundred of us).
We're hooting and hollering like wildmen. The band doubles back to the
street right below us and serenades us with Texas Fight and The Eyes of
Texas. AWESOME MOMENT.
12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity, 50-100 grown men are bumping chests
with one another, each and every one of them now secure and certain of the
fact that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. Again, we hoot
and holler like wildmen. Again, the band doubles back and stops right below
us to serenade us, this time, however, with the Nebraska fight songs.
*Although somewhat impressed by their spirit and verve, we remain convinced
that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome, somehow managing to stuff the
"Traveler" and 11 cans of beer into my pants.
1:47 I am in line surrounded by Nebraska fans. They are taunting me. I am
taunting back, still certain that we are going to kick the shit out of
Nebraska. I decide to challenge a particularly vocal Nebraska fan to play
 what I now call and will forever be remembered as "Cell-Phone Flop Out."
Remember flop out for a dollar? The rules are similar. I tell this Nebraska
jackass that if he's so confident in his team, he should "flop out" his cell
 phone RIGHT NOW and make plane reservations to Phoenix for the Fiesta
Bowl.
 And then I spoke these memorable words: "And not those damn refundable
tickets, either! You request those non-refundable, non-transferrable
sons-of-bitches!" He backs down. He is unworthy. I call Southwest Airlines
and buy two tickets to Phoenix, non-refundable and non-transferrable. Price:
 $712. He is humbled. He lowers his head in shame. I raise my cell phone in
 triumph to the cheers of hundreds of Texas fans. I am KING and these are my
 subjects. I distribute the 11 beers in my pants to the cheering masses. I
 RULE the pre-game kingdom.
2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence, I open the Traveler and pour my
first stiffy.
2:45 I notice something troubling: Nebraska is big. Nebraska is fast.
Nebraska is very pissed off at Texas.
3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends. 9 yards total offense for Texas.
Zero first downs for Texas. I'm still talking shit. I pour another stiffy
 from the Traveler.
3:36 Four minutes to go in the first half: the Traveler is a dead soldier.

I buy my first $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. While I am standing in
line, a center snap nearly decapitates Major Applewhite and rolls out of the
end zone. Safety.
3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas 0. I wish I had another Traveler.
4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska fan in the bathroom at halftime, I
attempt to revive the classic Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:
"Hey, buddy, niiiiiiiiice cock." He is unamused.
4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. I share my
beer with two high school girls sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they are
equipped with a flask full of vodka. I send them off to purchase Sprites, so
that we may consume their vodka. I have not lost faith.  Nebraska is a bunch
of pussies.
4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting behind me have fled for their lives.

I purchase two more $5 beers from the Alamodome merchants.
5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I am beginning to lose faith. This
normally would trouble me, but I am too drunk to see the football field.
5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: "I'm sorry, sir. Those tickets have been
confirmed and are non-refundable and non-transferrable."
5:37 I try to start a fight with every person behind the concession counter.
As it turns out, the Alamodome has a policy that no beer can be sold when
there is less than 10 minutes on the game clock. I am enraged by this
policy. I ask loudly: "Why the fuck didn't you announce last call over the
fucking PA system??!!"
5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in my chair in defeat. All of a sudden,
the Texas crowd goes absolutely nuts. "Whazzis?," I mutter, awaking from my
coma, "Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?" Alas, the answer is no, we were not
winning and we did not score. The largest (by far) cheer of the day from
the
Texas faithful occurred when the handlers were walking back to the tunnel
and Bevo stopped to take a gargantuan shit all over the letters "S", "K",
and "A" in the "Nebraska" spelled out in their end zone.  I cheer wildly.

I pick up the empty Traveler bottle and stick my tongue in it. I am thirsty.
6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as I walk back to the truck. I would
taunt them with some off-color remarks about their parentage, but I am too
drunk to form complete sentences. With my last cognitive thought of the
evening, I take solace in the fact that if we had not beaten them in
October, they would be playing Florida State for the national
championship.
6:30 Back in the car. On the way back to Austin for the 8:00 Texas-Arizona
tip off. We can still salvage the day! I crack open a beer.  *It is warm.

I don't care.
7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am hungry. I go inside the store. I walk
past the beer frig. I notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I wonder if it's
any good. I pull a Zima from the frig. I twist the top off and drink the
Zima in three swallows. Zima sucks. I replace the empty bottle in the frig.
7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the store. I walk to where the ingredients
are, where the person usually makes the sub. There is no one there. I lean
over the counter and scoop out half a bucket of black olives. I eat them.

I am still hungry. I lean further over the counter and grab approximately
two
pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the store grunting and eating Pastrami.
The patrons in the store fear me. I don't care.
8:01 We are in South Austin. I have been drinking warm beer and singing
Brooks and Dunn tunes for over an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my
singing. He suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn have written other good
songs besides "You're Going to Miss Me When I'm Gone" and "Neon Moon" and
that maybe listening to only those two songs, ten times each was a bit
excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I could just let the CD play on its own.

I tell him to fuck off and restart "Neon Moon."
8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My truckmate, against my loud and
profane protestations, parks on the top floor of a nearby parking garage.

I
tell him he's an idiot. I tell him we will never get out. I tell him we may

8:53 Crack open second beer
8:58 Crack open...(you get the idea)
10:30 Finish 18 (holes, as well as beers), sign scorecard for smoooooth 95
10:35 Headed for San Antonio
10:50 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and post-game festivities
11:10 We decide we don't have enough booze, so we double-back to a liquor
store and buy the good ol' 750 ml plastic bottle "Traveler" Jim Beam
11:50 Arrive at the tailgate spot. Awesome day. Not a single cloud in the
sky. About 70 degrees.
11:55 I decide that we're going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to go fuck himself.
12:15 The UT band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. We're on the second
floor of a two-story parking garage on the corner (a couple hundred of us).
We're hooting and hollering like wildmen. The band doubles back to the
street right below us and serenades us with Texas Fight and The Eyes of
Texas. AWESOME MOMENT.
12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity, 50-100 grown men are bumping chests
with one another, each and every one of them now secure and certain of the
fact that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. Again, we hoot
and holler like wildmen. Again, the band doubles back and stops right below
us to serenade us, this time, however, with the Nebraska fight songs.
*Although somewhat impressed by their spirit and verve, we remain convinced
that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome, somehow managing to stuff the
"Traveler" and 11 cans of beer into my pants.
1:47 I am in line surrounded by Nebraska fans. They are taunting me. I am
taunting back, still certain that we are going to kick the shit out of
Nebraska. I decide to challenge a particularly vocal Nebraska fan to play
 what I now call and will forever be remembered as "Cell-Phone Flop Out."
Remember flop out for a dollar? The rules are similar. I tell this Nebraska
jackass that if he's so confident in his team, he should "flop out" his cell
 phone RIGHT NOW and make plane reservations to Phoenix for the Fiesta
Bowl.
 And then I spoke these memorable words: "And not those damn refundable
tickets, either! You request those non-refundable, non-transferrable
sons-of-bitches!" He backs down. He is unworthy. I call Southwest Airlines
and buy two tickets to Phoenix, non-refundable and non-transferrable. Price:
 $712. He is humbled. He lowers his head in shame. I raise my cell phone in
 triumph to the cheers of hundreds of Texas fans. I am KING and these are my
 subjects. I distribute the 11 beers in my pants to the cheering masses. I
 RULE the pre-game kingdom.
2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence, I open the Traveler and pour my
first stiffy.
2:45 I notice something troubling: Nebraska is big. Nebraska is fast.
Nebraska is very pissed off at Texas.
3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends. 9 yards total offense for Texas.
Zero first downs for Texas. I'm still talking shit. I pour another stiffy
 from the Traveler.
3:36 Four minutes to go in the first half: the Traveler is a dead soldier.

I buy my first $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. While I am standing in
line, a center snap nearly decapitates Major Applewhite and rolls out of the
end zone. Safety.
3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas 0. I wish I had another Traveler.
4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska fan in the bathroom at halftime, I
attempt to revive the classic Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:
"Hey, buddy, niiiiiiiiice cock." He is unamused.
4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. I share my
beer with two high school girls sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they are
equipped with a flask full of vodka. I send them off to purchase Sprites, so
that we may consume their vodka. I have not lost faith.  Nebraska is a bunch
of pussies.
4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting behind me have fled for their lives.

I purchase two more $5 beers from the Alamodome merchants.
5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I am beginning to lose faith. This
normally would trouble me, but I am too drunk to see the football field.
5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: "I'm sorry, sir. Those tickets have been
confirmed and are non-refundable and non-transferrable."
5:37 I try to start a fight with every person behind the concession counter.
As it turns out, the Alamodome has a policy that no beer can be sold when
there is less than 10 minutes on the game clock. I am enraged by this
policy. I ask loudly: "Why the fuck didn't you announce last call over the
fucking PA system??!!"
5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in my chair in defeat. All of a sudden,
the Texas crowd goes absolutely nuts. "Whazzis?," I mutter, awaking from my
coma, "Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?" Alas, the answer is no, we were not
winning and we did not score. The largest (by far) cheer of the day from
the
Texas faithful occurred when the handlers were walking back to the tunnel
and Bevo stopped to take a gargantuan shit all over the letters "S", "K",
and "A" in the "Nebraska" spelled out in their end zone.  I cheer wildly.

I pick up the empty Traveler bottle and stick my tongue in it. I am thirsty.
6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as I walk back to the truck. I would
taunt them with some off-color remarks about their parentage, but I am too
drunk to form complete sentences. With my last cognitive thought of the
evening, I take solace in the fact that if we had not beaten them in
October, they would be playing Florida State for the national
championship.
6:30 Back in the car. On the way back to Austin for the 8:00 Texas-Arizona
tip off. We can still salvage the day! I crack open a beer.  *It is warm.

I don't care.
7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am hungry. I go inside the store. I walk
past the beer frig. I notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I wonder if it's
any good. I pull a Zima from the frig. I twist the top off and drink the
Zima in three swallows. Zima sucks. I replace the empty bottle in the frig.
7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the store. I walk to where the ingredients
are, where the person usually makes the sub. There is no one there. I lean
over the counter and scoop out half a bucket of black olives. I eat them.

I am still hungry. I lean further over the counter and grab approximately
two
pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the store grunting and eating Pastrami.
The patrons in the store fear me. I don't care.
8:01 We are in South Austin. I have been drinking warm beer and singing
Brooks and Dunn tunes for over an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my
singing. He suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn have written other good
songs besides "You're Going to Miss Me When I'm Gone" and "Neon Moon" and
that maybe listening to only those two songs, ten times each was a bit
excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I could just let the CD play on its own.

I tell him to fuck off and restart "Neon Moon."
8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My truckmate, against my loud and
profane protestations, parks on the top floor of a nearby parking garage.

I
tell him he's an idiot. I tell him we will never get out. I tell him we may
as well pitch a fucking tent here. He ignores me. I think he's still pissed
about the Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle "Neon Moon" loudly.
8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers stuffed in my pants. We're going to
kick the shit out of Arizona.
9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona 29. I am pleased. I go to the
bathroom to pee for the 67th time today. I giggle to myself because of the
new opportunity to do "the bathroom Brice." There are no Arizona fans in the
bathroom. I am disappointed. I tell myself (out loud) that I have a
"Niiiiiice cock." No one is amused but me.
9:41 I walk to the bathroom while drinking Bud Light out of a can.  Needless
to say, they do not sell beer at the Erwin Center,much less Bud Light out

of
a can. I am stopped by an usher: "Where did you get that, sir?" I tell him
(no shit): "Oh, the cheerleaders were throwing them up with those little
plastic footballs. Would you mind throwing this away for me?" I take the
last swig and hand it to him. He is confused. I pretend I'm going to the
bathroom, but I run away giggling instead. I duck into some entrance to
avoid the usher, who is now pursuing me. I sneak into a large group of
people and sit down. The usher walks by harmlessly. I am giggling like a
little girl. I crack open another can of Bud Light.
9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid the usher, I have lostmy bearings. I
have no ticket stub. I cannot find my seats. Texas is losing.
10:09 Texas is being screwed by the refs. I am enraged. I have cleared out
the seats around me because I keep removing my hat and beating the
surrounding chairs with it. A concerned fan asks if I'm OK and perhaps I
shouldn't take it so seriously. I tell him to fuck off.
10:15 After the fourth consecutive "worst fucking call I have EVER seen," I
attempt to remove my hat again to begin beating inanimate objects.  However,
on this occasion I miscalculate and I thumbnail myself in my left eyelid,
leaving a one-quarter inch gash over my eye. I am now bleeding into my left
eye and all over my shirt. "Perhaps," I think to myself, "I'm taking this a
bit seriously."
10:22 I am standing in the bathroom peeing. I'm so drunk I am swaying and
grunting. I have a bloody napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants are
bloody. I have my (formerly) white shirt wrapped around my waist. I look
like I should be in an episode of Cops.
10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody white shirt back on my body and make
my way for the exits. I am stopped every 20 seconds by a good
samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me why I am covered in blood, but I
merely grunt incoherently and keep moving.
10:59 With my one good eye, I have located the parking garage. I walk up six
flights of stairs, promise that when I see my friend I will punch him in the
face for making me walk up six flights of stairs, find the truck, and
collapse in a heap in the bed of the truck. I look around and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and

no one is moving. I take a nap.
11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my friend in the driver's seat. I lift my
head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up
all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving.  I
am too tired to punch my friend. I call my friend a "Stupid cocksucker."
11:31 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving. I call my friend a "Stupid cocksucker."
11:38 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving. I call my friend a "Stupid cocksucker."
11:47 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and

no one is moving. I call my friend a "Stupid cocksucker."
11:58 I am jostled. The truck is moving. I lift my head to look out the bed
of the truck and notice that traffic is beginning to move on the second
floor. I jump out of the truck, walk to the edge of the parking facility,
and pee off the sixth floor onto the street below. My friend looks at me
like I just anally violated his minor sister. I turn around and pee on the
front of his truck while singing the lyrics to "Neon Moon."
12:11 We are moving. We are out of beer. I jump from the truck and go from
vehicle to vehicle until someone gives me two beers. I am happy. I return to
my vehicle.
12:26 We have emerged from the parking facility. We make our way to my
apartment and find Ed sitting on the couch with a freshly opened bottle of
Glenlivet on the coffee table in front of him. We are all going to die
tonight.
12:59 We have finished three-quarters of the bottle of Glenlivet. We decide
it would be a wonderful idea to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has to pee.
He walks down the hall to our apartment and directly into the full length
 mirror at the end of the hall, smashing it into hundreds of pieces.  We
giggle uncontrollably and leave for PollyEsther's.
1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs uncontrollably at our efforts to enter
his club. "Fellas," he says in between his fits of spastic laughter, "I've
 been working this door for almost a year. I've been working doors in this
town for almost 5 years. And I can honestly say that I ain't never seen
three drunker mother fuckers than you three. Sorry, can't let you in." We
attempt to reason with him. He laughs harder.
1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We take two steps in the door and hear
"Last call for alcohol!" I turn to the group and mutter: "See, dat wasn't
that fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that at the Awamo...the awaom...the
alab...fuck it, that stadium we was at today..." We order 6 shots of tequila
and three beers.
2:15 Back on the street. We need food. We hail a cab to take us the two and
one half blocks to Katz's. The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10 and tell
him to keep it.
2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give the hostess $50. We are seated
immediately.
2:25 We order two orders of fried pickles, a Cobb salad, a bowl of soup, two
orders of Blueberry blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a hamburger, two cheese
stuffed potatoes, an order of fries, and an order of onion rings.
2:39 The food arrives. We are all asleep with our heads onthe table. The
waiter wakes us up. We eat every fucking bit of our food. Most of the
restaurant patrons around us are disgusted. We don't give a fuck. The tab is
$112 with tip.
2:46 I'm sleepy.
9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman. She is the bartender at Katz's.
She is not pretty.

> > A chronology of events for Saturday, December 4, 1999, and the early
morning
hours of Sunday, December 5, 1999:
6:00 Arise, play the Eyes of Texas and Texas Fight at full-freaking blast
6:20 Get in car, drive to New Braunfels
7:30 Tee off (me and a buddy were the FIRST tee-time of the morning)
8:50 Turn 9 (crack open first beer)
8:53 Crack open second beer
8:58 Crack open...(you get the idea)
10:30 Finish 18 (holes, as well as beers), sign scorecard for smoooooth 95
10:35 Headed for San Antonio
10:50 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and post-game festivities
11:10 We decide we don't have enough booze, so we double-back to a liquor
store and buy the good ol' 750 ml plastic bottle "Traveler" Jim Beam
11:50 Arrive at the tailgate spot. Awesome day. Not a single cloud in the
sky. About 70 degrees.
11:55 I decide that we're going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to go fuck himself.
12:15 The UT band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. We're on the second
floor of a two-story parking garage on the corner (a couple hundred of us).
We're hooting and hollering like wildmen. The band doubles back to the
street right below us and serenades us with Texas Fight and The Eyes of
Texas. AWESOME MOMENT.
12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity, 50-100 grown men are bumping chests
with one another, each and every one of them now secure and certain of the
fact that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. Again, we hoot
and holler like wildmen. Again, the band doubles back and stops right below
us to serenade us, this time, however, with the Nebraska fight songs.
*Although somewhat impressed by their spirit and verve, we remain convinced
that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome, somehow managing to stuff the
"Traveler" and 11 cans of beer into my pants.
1:47 I am in line surrounded by Nebraska fans. They are taunting me. I am
taunting back, still certain that we are going to kick the shit out of
Nebraska. I decide to challenge a particularly vocal Nebraska fan to play
 what I now call and will forever be remembered as "Cell-Phone Flop Out."
Remember flop out for a dollar? The rules are similar. I tell this Nebraska
jackass that if he's so confident in his team, he should "flop out" his cell
 phone RIGHT NOW and make plane reservations to Phoenix for the Fiesta
Bowl.
 And then I spoke these memorable words: "And not those damn refundable
tickets, either! You request those non-refundable, non-transferrable
sons-of-bitches!" He backs down. He is unworthy. I call Southwest Airlines
and buy two tickets to Phoenix, non-refundable and non-transferrable. Price:
 $712. He is humbled. He lowers his head in shame. I raise my cell phone in
 triumph to the cheers of hundreds of Texas fans. I am KING and these are my
 subjects. I distribute the 11 beers in my pants to the cheering masses. I
 RULE the pre-game kingdom.
2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence, I open the Traveler and pour my
first stiffy.
2:45 I notice something troubling: Nebraska is big. Nebraska is fast.
Nebraska is very pissed off at Texas.
3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends. 9 yards total offense for Texas.
Zero first downs for Texas. I'm still talking shit. I pour another stiffy
 from the Traveler.
3:36 Four minutes to go in the first half: the Traveler is a dead soldier.

I buy my first $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. While I am standing in
line, a center snap nearly decapitates Major Applewhite and rolls out of the
end zone. Safety.
3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas 0. I wish I had another Traveler.
4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska fan in the bathroom at halftime, I
attempt to revive the classic Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:
"Hey, buddy, niiiiiiiiice cock." He is unamused.
4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. I share my
beer with two high school girls sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they are
equipped with a flask full of vodka. I send them off to purchase Sprites, so
that we may consume their vodka. I have not lost faith.  Nebraska is a bunch
of pussies.
4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting behind me have fled for their lives.

I purchase two more $5 beers from the Alamodome merchants.
5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I am beginning to lose faith. This
normally would trouble me, but I am too drunk to see the football field.
5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: "I'm sorry, sir. Those tickets have been
confirmed and are non-refundable and non-transferrable."
5:37 I try to start a fight with every person behind the concession counter.
As it turns out, the Alamodome has a policy that no beer can be sold when
there is less than 10 minutes on the game clock. I am enraged by this
policy. I ask loudly: "Why the fuck didn't you announce last call over the
fucking PA system??!!"
5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in my chair in defeat. All of a sudden,
the Texas crowd goes absolutely nuts. "Whazzis?," I mutter, awaking from my
coma, "Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?" Alas, the answer is no, we were not
winning and we did not score. The largest (by far) cheer of the day from
the
Texas faithful occurred when the handlers were walking back to the tunnel
and Bevo stopped to take a gargantuan shit all over the letters "S", "K",
and "A" in the "Nebraska" spelled out in their end zone.  I cheer wildly.

I pick up the empty Traveler bottle and stick my tongue in it. I am thirsty.
6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as I walk back to the truck. I would
taunt them with some off-color remarks about their parentage, but I am too
drunk to form complete sentences. With my last cognitive thought of the
evening, I take solace in the fact that if we had not beaten them in
October, they would be playing Florida State for the national
championship.
6:30 Back in the car. On the way back to Austin for the 8:00 Texas-Arizona
tip off. We can still salvage the day! I crack open a beer.  *It is warm.

I don't care.
7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am hungry. I go inside the store. I walk
past the beer frig. I notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I wonder if it's
any good. I pull a Zima from the frig. I twist the top off and drink the
Zima in three swallows. Zima sucks. I replace the empty bottle in the frig.
7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the store. I walk to where the ingredients
are, where the person usually makes the sub. There is no one there. I lean
over the counter and scoop out half a bucket of black olives. I eat them.

I am still hungry. I lean further over the counter and grab approximately
two
pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the store grunting and eating Pastrami.
The patrons in the store fear me. I don't care.
8:01 We are in South Austin. I have been drinking warm beer and singing
Brooks and Dunn tunes for over an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my
singing. He suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn have written other good
songs besides "You're Going to Miss Me When I'm Gone" and "Neon Moon" and
that maybe listening to only those two songs, ten times each was a bit
excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I could just let the CD play on its own.

I tell him to fuck off and restart "Neon Moon."
8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My truckmate, against my loud and
profane protestations, parks on the top floor of a nearby parking garage.

I
tell him he's an idiot. I tell him we will never get out. I tell him we may
as well pitch a fucking tent here. He ignores me. I think he's still pissed
about the Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle "Neon Moon" loudly.
8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers stuffed in my pants. We're going to
kick the shit out of Arizona.
9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona 29. I am pleased. I go to the
bathroom to pee for the 67th time today. I giggle to myself because of the
new opportunity to do "the bathroom Brice." There are no Arizona fans in the
bathroom. I am disappointed. I tell myself (out loud) that I have a
"Niiiiiice cock." No one is amused but me.
9:41 I walk to the bathroom while drinking Bud Light out of a can.  Needless
to say, they do not sell beer at the Erwin Center,much less Bud Light out

of
a can. I am stopped by an usher: "Where did you get that, sir?" I tell him
(no shit): "Oh, the cheerleaders were throwing them up with those little
plastic footballs. Would you mind throwing this away for me?" I take the
last swig and hand it to him. He is confused. I pretend I'm going to the
bathroom, but I run away giggling instead. I duck into some entrance to
avoid the usher, who is now pursuing me. I sneak into a large group of
people and sit down. The usher walks by harmlessly. I am giggling like a
little girl. I crack open another can of Bud Light.
9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid the usher, I have lostmy bearings. I
have no ticket stub. I cannot find my seats. Texas is losing.
10:09 Texas is being screwed by the refs. I am enraged. I have cleared out
the seats around me because I keep removing my hat and beating the
surrounding chairs with it. A concerned fan asks if I'm OK and perhaps I
shouldn't take it so seriously. I tell him to fuck off.
10:15 After the fourth consecutive "worst fucking call I have EVER seen," I
attempt to remove my hat again to begin beating inanimate objects.  However,
on this occasion I miscalculate and I thumbnail myself in my left eyelid,
leaving a one-quarter inch gash over my eye. I am now bleeding into my left
eye and all over my shirt. "Perhaps," I think to myself, "I'm taking this a
bit seriously."
10:22 I am standing in the bathroom peeing. I'm so drunk I am swaying and
grunting. I have a bloody napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants are
bloody. I have my (formerly) white shirt wrapped around my waist. I look
like I should be in an episode of Cops.
10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody white shirt back on my body and make
my way for the exits. I am stopped every 20 seconds by a good
samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me why I am covered in blood, but I
merely grunt incoherently and keep moving.
10:59 With my one good eye, I have located the parking garage. I walk up six
flights of stairs, promise that when I see my friend I will punch him in the
face for making me walk up six flights of stairs, find the truck, and
collapse in a heap in the bed of the truck. I look around and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and

no one is moving. I take a nap.
11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my friend in the driver's seat. I lift my
head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up
all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving.  I
am too tired to punch my friend. I call my friend a "Stupid cocksucker."
11:31 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving. I call my friend a "Stupid cocksucker."
11:38 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving. I call my friend a "Stupid cocksucker."
11:47 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and

no one is moving. I call my friend a "Stupid cocksucker."
11:58 I am jostled. The truck is moving. I lift my head to look out the bed
of the truck and notice that traffic is beginning to move on the second
floor. I jump out of the truck, walk to the edge of the parking facility,
and pee off the sixth floor onto the street below. My friend looks at me
like I just anally violated his minor sister. I turn around and pee on the
front of his truck while singing the lyrics to "Neon Moon."
12:11 We are moving. We are out of beer. I jump from the truck and go from
vehicle to vehicle until someone gives me two beers. I am happy. I return to
my vehicle.
12:26 We have emerged from the parking facility. We make our way to my
apartment and find Ed sitting on the couch with a freshly opened bottle of
Glenlivet on the coffee table in front of him. We are all going to die
tonight.
12:59 We have finished three-quarters of the bottle of Glenlivet. We decide
it would be a wonderful idea to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has to pee.
He walks down the hall to our apartment and directly into the full length
 mirror at the end of the hall, smashing it into hundreds of pieces.  We
giggle uncontrollably and leave for PollyEsther's.
1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs uncontrollably at our efforts to enter
his club. "Fellas," he says in between his fits of spastic laughter, "I've
 been working this door for almost a year. I've been working doors in this
town for almost 5 years. And I can honestly say that I ain't never seen
three drunker mother fuckers than you three. Sorry, can't let you in." We
attempt to reason with him. He laughs harder.
1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We take two steps in the door and hear
"Last call for alcohol!" I turn to the group and mutter: "See, dat wasn't
that fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that at the Awamo...the awaom...the
alab...fuck it, that stadium we was at today..." We order 6 shots of tequila
and three beers.
2:15 Back on the street. We need food. We hail a cab to take us the two and
one half blocks to Katz's. The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10 and tell
him to keep it.
2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give the hostess $50. We are seated
immediately.
2:25 We order two orders of fried pickles, a Cobb salad, a bowl of soup, two
orders of Blueberry blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a hamburger, two cheese
stuffed potatoes, an order of fries, and an order of onion rings.
2:39 The food arrives. We are all asleep with our heads onthe table. The
waiter wakes us up. We eat every fucking bit of our food. Most of the
restaurant patrons around us are disgusted. We don't give a fuck. The tab is
$112 with tip.
2:46 I'm sleepy.
9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman. She is the bartender at Katz's.
She is not pretty.

Juiced

By Julia King and Gary H. Anthes
(Nov. 20, 2000) Wall Street analysts and oil industry executives were thick 
among the legion of skeptics who thought Enron Corp. President and Chief 
Operating Officer Jeff Skilling was nuts to launch a Web site for the trading 
of natural gas and electricity over the Internet. 
That was last November, before EnronOnline locked up more than $120 billion 
in transactions in its first few months of operation, quickly establishing 
itself as the world's largest e-commerce company. As of Oct. 11, just prior 
to Enron's report of its third-quarter earnings, EnronOnline had executed 
more than 350,000 transactions, representing a gross value of $183 billion. 
Since then, the $40 billion Houston-based energy giant has elbowed its way 
into several new diversified markets. And it plans to continue its push into 
many more, ranging from railcar cargo space to broadband networking and 
data-storage capacity. 
In doing so, Enron is turbocharging its transformation from a stodgy, 
old-line fuel company to an entirely new kind of business-to-business market 
maker, with information technology and an all-out emphasis on 
entrepreneurship at the heart of its New Economy operations. Enron has been 
so successful in leveraging IT to pioneer new markets that others are trying 
to emulate its approach. 







First to Market 
"Enron often introduces a product before the competition even senses a market 
exists," the company says in its latest annual report. A prime example: 
online trading of data-network capacity. 
Indeed, "there's a low degree of awareness [among carriers] about the 
bandwidth-trading business," and Enron is ahead of the game, says Seth Libby, 
an analyst at The Yankee Group in Boston. 
At present, there are only a handful of network professionals who are aware 
of these capacity commoditization plans, says Libby. But not for long, 
asserts Enron President?? Jeff Skilling. "Within five years, the bandwidth 
market may be bigger than the gas and electric markets," he says. "So for us, 
it could be as big as the rest of our existing energy business." That's 
currently a $35 billion business. 
But critics say trading bandwidth is much more complicated than trading gas, 
especially for a company with little depth in telecommunications. And critics 
add that although carriers stand to benefit from the ability to buy and sell 
capacity, they might prefer to do it through some channel that's independent 
of the control of a single market maker like Enron. 
"Enron's argument is that its trading capabilities are the differentiator, 
and that it need not have deep telecom expertise," says Lisa Pierce, an 
analyst at Giga Information Group in Stamford, Conn. "But I'm not convinced 
it's that simple. Technology isn't a long-term competitive differentiator." 
Houston-based Enron Broadband Services Inc., formed last year, offers IP 
transport on its 15,000-mile fiber-optic network. Enron Broadband Services 
also trades - that is, makes a market by buying and selling - network 
capacity to and from other data carriers, conducting some of the transactions 
on EnronOnline. 
Enron Broadband Services also offers content-oriented services, such as a 
video-on-demand service it will market with Dallas-based Blockbuster Inc. to 
home viewers starting next month. 
"When we started the gas business, they told us we were nuts," Skilling says. 
"They said, 'You're going to sell gas but not own production? How does that 
work?' Then we did electricity and they said we were nuts again, and even 
louder than before. They said this stuff moves at the speed of light; you can 
never create a market. Then in telecommunications, they said we were nuts 
again." 
Despite its share of skeptics, some experts like Enron's prospects in this 
space. "I think aspects of this have the potential to be very big," says 
Libby. "The carriers like the idea of instantaneous provisioning. And I think 
it has a lot of potential [for] . . . selling it to businesses and giving 
them the ability to cut their costs significantly by buying it as they need 
it." 





"We aspire to that kind of model," says Fred Buehler, director of electronic 
business at Eastman Chemical Co. in Kingsport, Tenn. 
"In every sector, there will be one or two innovators who get out front and 
do things differently to create shareholder value," Buehler says. "We're 
trying to be one of them." 
Market Maker 
Stroll through the gas-trading section on the 32nd floor of Enron's 
glistening 50-story headquarters, and the company's technological 
sophistication is immediately evident. Traders like 26-year-old John Arnold, 
who personally executes about $1 billion per day in trades, have real-time 
access to virtually any information that might affect their split-second 
buy-and-sell decisions. 
That information might be a meteorologist's prediction of a 
colder-than-normal winter across the Plains states or a live news report of 
political instability in an oil-producing country in the Middle East. 
Behind the scenes, all of Arnold's trades are instantly analyzed and 
processed by a sophisticated, proprietary risk-management system and then 
updated across multiple back-end computer systems worldwide. Less than a year 
after launching the operation, 60% of the world's gas is traded on 
EnronOnline. 
"What we are doing, no one in the industry did 10 years ago. Eighty percent 
of our income this year is from businesses that didn't exist 10 years ago," 
says Skilling. 
For example, EnronOnline contributed heavily to its parent company's 
third-quarter earnings, which were up 31% to $292 million, compared with the 
same period last year. 
"The change is technology-driven," Skilling adds. "We couldn't do what we do 
without massive amounts of computing capability." In this regard, Enron joins 
a short list of companies that includes Wal-Mart Stores Inc., FedEx Corp. and 
American Airlines Inc., which famously pioneered various mission-critical IT 
techniques to leapfrog competitors and create a whole new class of IT-enabled 
industry leaders. 
Among Enron's boldest ideas is its use of a single, powerful software-based 
trading platform to insert itself as a principal buyer or seller in hundreds 
of different markets. Currently, Enron trades more than 1,000 different 
commodities, such as gold, natural gas and metals, on EnronOnline. 
"The core of our business is our business model, which is a centralized 
risk-management and market-making business model. It just so happens that the 
Internet is just perfect for improving the efficiency of that model," 
Skilling says. 
But as a market maker, EnronOnline stands alone. For starters, unlike most 
other Internet marketplaces, it's free. There are no transaction fees or 
catalog, inventory or subscription costs for users. 
"Enron has broken away from the pack in the last year, in terms of their 
capital growth," says Ian Wylie, vice president of e-business at BP Amoco PLC 
in London. "And e-business is responsible for a lot of this change." 
Even more unusual is Enron's role as a principal in each transaction. That 
means Enron is either the buyer or seller in every trade in which it's 
involved, unlike market makers that simply act as matchmakers between buyers 
and sellers. 
In fact, Skilling, as well as Mike McConnell, who heads EnronOnline's global 
expansion efforts as president and CEO of Enron Global Markets LLC, dismisses 
much of the current hyperactivity surrounding other fee-based 
business-to-business exchanges as a flash in the pan. 
"[Many of the] B2B guys think all you have to do is set up a bulletin board 
and people will start transacting, but it doesn't work that way," Skilling 
says. "You need to know you can deliver if push comes to shove." 
As either the seller or buyer in all of its trades, Enron, an established 
brand name with 32,000 miles of pipeline and deep financial pockets, 
guarantees delivery or payment on all trades that are executed on 
EnronOnline. 
"We're creating markets that were highly illiquid, so someone has to put 
their reputation on the line to say, 'We'll deliver,' " Skilling says. 
But guaranteeing delivery also requires having guaranteed access to physical 
assets such as network bandwidth and papermaking plants. Guaranteed access 
also ensures marketplace liquidity. For Enron, this is where the bricks and 
mortar come in. 
For example, to help drive its liquidity in the pulp and paper market, Enron 
paid $72 million in July for Garden State Paper Co., a recycled-newsprint 
mill in Garfield, N.J. 
Skilling's current market fancy is metals, and in May, Enron bought MG PLC, a 
London-based metals marketer. "You have to break the liquidity logjam, and to 
do that, you have to take a risk position," Skilling says. 
But once the logjam is cleared, Enron is just as likely to sell off the 
brick-and-mortar assets it acquired and use the cash to invest in new 
business. 
For example, to finance its new bandwidth-trading operation, Enron is selling 
Portland General Electric Co., a Portland, Ore.-based power producer that it 
bought in 1997, so it could bring liquidity to and guarantee trades in the 
online electricity market. 
Eventually, Enron may end up trading commodities that aren't even considered 
commodities - at least not at the moment - such as data storage capacity or 
empty railcar space. 
"Might we move into sauces or meats or grains? Potentially," says McConnell, 
who was Enron's de facto CIO before moving into his current role. 
"You have to be creative every day," McConnell says. "You have to be 
open-minded to trying new things." 
But what remains constant throughout all the upsizing and downsizing is 
Enron's core IT-enabled business model, which is what puts it in a class of 
its own, analysts say. 
"People have talked a lot about systems that they're about to roll out, but 
there is just not much out there for direct trading," says Mike Heim, an 
energy analyst at A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. in St. Louis. "Enron rolled out 
its technology 10 months ago, and still there isn't much else out there. 
There hasn't been much competition [because] there isn't anybody in the same 
class." 
But just last month, Houston-based Dynegy Inc. launched Dynegydirect, an 
Internet-based, commission-free trading site for energy and communications 
commodities. 
Also last month, IntercontinentalExchange in Atlanta, whose partners include 
BP Amoco and The Hague-based Royal Dutch/Shell Group, added natural gas and 
power to its online trading system, which already included precious metals 
and crude oil. 
Skilling doesn't get called "nuts" much anymore. In fact, he's a darling on 
Wall Street, where Enron's stock has soared from around $40 per share last 
November to $81 as of this Nov. 2. As a result, Enron - by all accounts, an 
Old Economy gas pipeline company until 12 months ago - is widely regarded as 
a New Economy pioneer. 
Says Skilling, "We like to say we were B2B before there was B2B." 

Thriving On the Unconventional 
As head of two Enron pipeline subsidiaries, Mike McConnell knew a lot more 
about gas flows than he did about data flows last year when he got a surprise 
call from Enron President and Chief Operating Officer Jeff Skilling. 
Recalls McConnell, "Jeff went into this whole thought process about how the 
Internet is changing everything. He said, 'We need to make Enron an 
e-business, and I need a guy that can run this as a business. We need to 
change the way we view technology.' 
"I thought he was a little crazy and I said, 'Jeff, I'm not a technology 
person at all,' He said, 'No, seriously - this is going to be big.' So I took 
over as CEO of Enron Global Technology," and thus became the company's de 
facto CIO, McConnell explains. 
Appointing a person with no technology background to the top IT post is an 
unusual move. But Enron often defies convention and typically thrives as a 
result. Indeed, Enron boasts an entrepreneurial culture that's unusual in 
large, long-established companies, and in utilities firms in particular. 
McConnell relates the tale of how 29-year-old Louise Kitchen, Enron's head 
gas trader in Europe, spearheaded the creation of an online gas-trading 
system, recruiting IT people from elsewhere in the company to do the 
development work. Word of the Web-based platform, EnronOnline, which is 
literally remaking the company, didn't reach top management until a few weeks 
before it went live. 
Kitchen enlisted the support of Enron's initially skeptical top traders, and 
she scoured the company for software developers and other experts. Her small 
army of volunteers worked nights and weekends on the project while carrying 
on with their regular jobs. 
"It's an amazing story about not getting corporate approval and going through 
all the bureaucracy," McConnell says. "No one went to the board and said, 'We 
want to change the way we trade.' You just do it." 
Glowing Endorsement 
Soon after McConnell became the de facto CIO of the $40 billion energy 
company, he joined eight of Sun Microsystems Inc.'s top Houston customers at 
a breakfast hosted by Sun CEO Scott McNealy. 
"I was very nervous," recalls McConnell, 40. "I mean, McNealy is the guy, and 
here I know nothing about technology. I'd been on the job maybe two weeks." 
McNealy asked the attendees - all but McConnell were middle-aged CIOs with 
many years of IT experience - to introduce themselves in turn. 
"When Scott came to me, I said, 'I'm the CEO of Global Technology, and we 
want to be the leader in B2B commerce in the world.' He kind of sat back and 
said, 'How long have you been in the IT business?' " McConnell explains. " 
'About nine days,' I said, 'and we are going to take a little bit different 
approach to technology.' Scott chuckled and said, 'That sounds like Enron; it 
always looks at things differently.' He then stated that my CEO title and 
Enron's approach were very unusual but that it would be more commonplace 
soon, as this was the way of the future." 
McConnell says McNealy's endorsement had "a huge impact" on how he structured 
IT at Enron during the following year. 
"I realized that we weren't too late to change our approach and take a 
commercial view of technology," he says - a view of IT as an integral part of 
the business, not as something that supports business functions. "None of the 
other companies were thinking our new way at all." 
Taking a commercial view of IT has led to a blurring of the line that 
traditionally separates IT organizations from the business units they 
support. When McConnell became CEO of Global Technology, Enron had five CIOs 
who were predominantly operating independently inside the company's major 
lines of business. 
"Each CIO had his own agenda, his own thought process, his own goals, and 
they did not communicate at all," he says. 
McConnell established corporate standards for IT, created a management team 
that included the five CIOs and put all IT people under a new chief 
technology officer, Philippe Bibi. 
But IT is far from centralized at Enron. "We wanted to make people think 
about technology not as IT and support, but as an extension of your 
business," he explains. "So we seeded people out into the business units. 
[IT] directs the performance review process, but the business units have the 
greatest influence on where the person actually ranks and is rated." 
Firms like Enron that merge IT departments with the business units they serve 
will be the winners among fast-paced e-businesses, says IT organization 
expert Robert Zawacki, president of Zawacki and Associates in Colorado 
Springs and a professor emeritus at the University of Colorado, also in 
Colorado Springs. "We need more entrepreneurial leaders in IT, and 
[McConnell] is certainly one," he says. 
IT makes it easier to be entrepreneurial, says McConnell, who is now 
president and CEO of Enron Global Markets. "We really do like to try things 
and see what happens, and when you have an electronic platform like 
[EnronOnline] that we can model into different sectors, it's very inexpensive 
to try it. We are not afraid; if it's not working, we'll just stop." - Gary 
H. Anthes and Julia King

NFL Reports Player Updates 	
Latest NFL Player News - Provided by Commissioner.COM

Erron Kinney <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=187582&>, TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
Kinney is listed as questionable for Sunday's game because of a calf injury. He missed Monday's game because of the injury. 

Frank Wycheck <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1372&>, TE TEN - Anorexic Drunks Updated 11/14/01
Titans' head coach Jeff Fisher told The Nashville Tennesean that Wycheck's sprained ankle is not a substantial injury. Wycheck suffered the injury Monday, but is expected to play in Sunday's game.

Shad Meier <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=235120&>, TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
Meier is still recovering from thumb surgery and is questionable for Sunday's game. He would have gotten substantial playing time Monday against Baltimore had he played, but won't be needed now that the Titans have two healthy tight ends. 

Amos Zereoue <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=133462&>, RB PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
Zereoue is listed as questionable for Sunday's game. He has been sidelined for almost a month because of a shoulder injury. 

Damon Jones <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1736&>, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
An MRI on Jones' injured shoulder didn't reveal any structural damage. However, his status for Sunday's game remains uncertain. 

Mike McMahon <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=235119&>, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
According to published reports, the Lions hope to give McMahon some limited action during upcoming games. He is not expected to play full-time, but this development means that! C! harlie Batch might lose some playing time, hurting his overall Fantasy value.

Byron Chamberlain <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1496&>, TE MIN - Clubbers Updated 11/14/01
An MRI revealed a small cartilage tear in Chamberlain's right knee, but he is not expected to require surgery. All signs point to him playing Monday against the Giants, so feel free to use him this week.

Freddie Jones <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1843&>, TE SD - Manchester United Updated 11/14/01
The San Diego Union-Tribune says Jones (ankle) has been advised against playing this week. Results of an MRI exam are not available yet, but Steve Heiden is expected to start in his place.

Tim Dwight <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=12340&>, WR SD - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
Dwight (lung) is doubtful for Sunday's game. He has not been very healthy when productive, so don't count on him for much production from him during the rest of the season.

Troy Hambrick <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=194768&>, RB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
Hambrick is dealing with a rotator cuff injury, but he's expected to practice later in the week. He'll like! ly! start his third consecutive game this weekend if Emmitt Smith's knee isn't 100 percent by Friday. 

Emmitt Smith <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1094&>, RB DAL - Mandeville Marriage Updated 11/14/01
Smith (knee) is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Philadelphia. If he is unable to go, Troy Hambrick would likely start his third straight game, barring any further damage to his injured shoulder. 

Chris Weinke <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=235174&>, QB CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
Weinke (shoulder) was only able to throw on the sidelines Tuesday, but was expected to practice on Wednesday. If he is unable to play, Matt Lytle would likely make his second consecutive start. 

Peyton Manning <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=12531&>, QB IND - Dirty Bastards Updated 11/14/01
The Indianapolis Star says Manning had a splint inserted to stabilize the teeth in his lower jaw. He is expected to start on Sunday.

Drew Bledsoe <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1041&>, QB NE - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
Bledsoe has been cleared to play, but Tom Brady will start against the Rams. Bledsoe said he will try ! an! d prove he is ready to play by performing well in practice, but it doesn't appear likely he will get a chance to start. But the future past Week 10 appears to be unclear, and there is no guarantee Brady will hold onto the job past the Rams game.

O.J. McDuffie <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1246&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
McDuffie is ready to return to practice from the PUP list. He will be eligible for activation on Dec. 4, but he may still miss the rest of the season.

Aaron Brooks <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=133233&>, QB NO - Clubbers Updated 11/14/01
According to published reports, many veterans on the New Orleans roster have expressed their displeasure with Brooks' inconsistency this season. The reports also stated that those same veterans would rather see Jeff Blake under center, but that doesn't seem likely to happen. The coaching staff feels as though Brooks has the talent to be a top-notch NFL quarterback, so don't expect a change under center any time soon. 

Cowboys <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=8&>, DT DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
Linebacker Dexter Coakley is expected to miss two weeks of action due to a sprained knee. He suffered the injury during last weekend's loss to Atlanta. Dallas' defense has played well, but they're an inconsistent unit from a Fantasy perspective. 

Jon Hilbert <http://football434.fanta! sy! .nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=195687&>, K NO - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
Hilbert has been signed by the Dallas Cowboys, and will serve as their starting kicker in Tim Seder's absence. Hilbert's value as a Fantasy player is still minimal at this point, however, so don't bother picking him up outside of deeper leagues. 

Tim Seder <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=196725&>, K DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
Seder is expected to miss several weeks of action after injuring his ankle last Sunday against Atlanta. The team has signed former New Orleans booter Jon Hilbert to take over the kicking duties in Dallas. 

Rob Moore <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1183&>, WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
Moore, who had hamstring surgery two weeks ago, will begin some light running on Wednesday. His status for the rest of the season is still unclear, however, so don't bother picking him up off the waiver wire. 

Terry Hardy <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=12423&>, TE ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
Hardy (shoulder) is expected to miss a few more weeks of action. Unless you play in a very deep league, holding onto him isn't advisable at this point. 

Terry Allen <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodr! ow! s&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1177&>, RB BAL - Manchester United Updated 11/14/01
Allen will be sidelined four to six weeks because of a fractured left hand. He suffered the injury in Monday's game. Jason Brookins will start in his absence.

Steve McNair <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
McNair will wear a cast on his throwing hand for at least a day after aggravating an injury during Monday night's 16-10 loss to Baltimore. He had X-rays and other tests on his right hand Tuesday, and coach Jeff Fisher said the results were negative. But doctors found an apparent hairline break in McNair's thumb, which he originally hurt last season in practice. He is questionable for Sunday's game. "We put him in a cast until tomorrow [Wednesday]. We'll see how he is with some soft tosses going with the hand," Fisher said. 

Ricky Watters <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1151&>, RB SEA - Bees Updated 11/13/01
According to the Seattle Times, Watters is expected to return from his shoulder injury in two weeks. However, he is not guaranteed to reclaim the starting running back job with Shaun! A! lexander performing so well. We recommend you hold onto both players until it becomes clear which one will get the starts over the second half of the season, although we're betting it will be Alexander.

Rod Smith <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1220&>, WR DEN - Dirty Bastards Updated 11/13/01
Smith predicted Monday that he will be able to return from a sprained right ankle in time for Sunday's game against Washington. If he can't go, Keith Poole would become Denver's top receiving option, with Chris Cole, Scottie Montgomery and Kevin Kasper also filling in. However, Poole is already expected to replace Eddie Kennison as the team's second wideout.

Edd! ie! Kennison <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1296&> , WR DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/13/01
Kennison returned to the Broncos Monday and informed them that he is "unretiring," according to the Denver Post. While this is a radical turnaround from his message of retirement over the weekend, he might not be welcomed back by the team as a result of his change of decision. It is unclear whether Kennison will be placed on the reserve/suspended list or reinstated to the roster, but either way it's highly unlikely he will be able to help any Fantasy teams the remainder of the season. Drop him.

Cameron Cleeland <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=12277&>, TE NO - Team Sensitive Updated 11/13/01
According to published reports, Cleeland won't be available for Sunday's game against Indianapol! is! . His high ankle sprain still hasn't healed sufficently, so look for Boo Williams and Lamont Hall to get the majority of the playing time in his absence. 

Santana Moss <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=235234&>, WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 11/13/01
Moss is expected to make his season debut Sunday against Miami. He has been sidelined all season with a knee injury but is listed as probable for Sunday's game.

Wayne Chrebet <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1263&>, WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 11/13/01
Chrebet is expected to play Sunday, despite suffering from a shoulder injury. Look for him to be a solid No. 2 Fantasy recei! v! er. 

Fred Taylor <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=12753&>, RB JAC - Baton Rouge Idiot Updated 11/13/01
Taylor is expected to play Sunday against Pittsburgh. He has been sidelined for over a month because of a groin injury.

Teams Player News 	
Manchester United Player News - Provided by Commissioner.COM

Terry Allen <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-n! ew! s&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1177&>, Reserve RB Updated 11/14/01
Allen will be sidelined four to six weeks because of a fractured left hand. He suffered the injury in Monday's game. Jason Brookins will start in his absence.

Freddie Jones <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1843&>, Reserve TE Updated 11/14/01
The San Diego Union-Tribune says Jones (ankle) has been advised against playing this week. Results of an MRI exam are not available yet, but Steve Heiden is expected to start in his place.

Jeff Garcia <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=146325&>, Active QB Updated 11/13/01
Garcia made it through another game using a brace to protect his sprained knee, and had no problems afterwards. Head Coach Steve Mariucci is optimistic that Garcia will be able to play without the brace soon. 

Edgerrin James <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=133320&>, Reserve RB Updated 11/12/01
James will miss at least two more games with a knee injury. James practiced late in the week after his injury but felt some swelling and stiffness in his left knee. Further tests showed ligament damage. "Our doctors felt it was appropriate to shut him down for another two or three weeks," Colts president Bill Polian said Monday. "They're not certain what the severity is." Some published reports say James might miss the rest of the season.

Lamar Smith <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1160&>, Active RB Updated 11/11/01
The Colts' defense held Smith to 53 yards on 18 carries. Rookie Travis Minor rushed for 71 yards and a TD (56 yards), and now there will be rampant speculation that Smith might be fading as a Fantasy player.

Garrison Hearst <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1164&>, Reserve RB Updated 11/11/01
Hearst had solid game against New Orleans, compiling 160 scrimmage yards on Sunday. He seems to have established himself as San Francisco's featured back in recent weeks, which is keeping Kevan Barlow's Fantasy value at a minimum. 

Muhsin Muhammad <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1203&>, Reserve WR Updated 11/11/01
Muhammad finally had a somewhat productive game, catching six passes for 75 yards against St. Louis. If the quarterback situation in Carolina doesn't improve, however, Muhammad could have a tough time being productive the rest of the season. 

Marvin Harrison <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1231&>, Active WR Updated 11/11/01
Harrison scorched the Dolphins for nine receptions, 174 yards and three TDs. No defense is the league can contain Harrison when he plays in front of the home crowd.

Dominic Rhodes <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=236986&>, Active RB Updated 11/11/01
Rhodes left Sunday's game in the first quarter with a dislocated left shoulder. He was replaced by Kevin McDougal, and returned in the second quarter.

Vinny Testaverde <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1007&>, Reserve QB Updated 11/08/01
The Kansas City defense is definitely vulnerable to the pass, but the Jets haven't been throwing the ball enough to please Fantasy leaguers. Don't start Testaverde unless your team is very thin at QB.

Tim Brown <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1267&>, Active WR Updated 11/08/01
Brown caught three passes for 47 yards against the Seahawks in the teams' first meeting this year. He should perfom better if Seattle pays more attention to Jerry Rice (two TDs in first meeting) in this week's matchup. 

Jay Riemersma <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1662&>, Active TE Updated 11/04/01
Riemersma had five catches for 46 yards and a touchdown in Sunday's game against Indianapolis. He has put up decent yardage numbers for a tight end, but the TD against the Colts was his first of the season. 

Matt Stover <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1377&>, Active K Updated 10/25/01
Stover has a minor leg injury that will prevent him from kicking off but he will be able to kick field goals, according to published reports. The injury isn't considered serious but the Ravens are considering Steve Lindsey and Jaret Holmes as candidates to handle kickoffs. 

Germane Crowell <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=12306&>, Injured WR Updated 10/24/01
The Detroit Lions placed Crowell on injured reserve on Tuesday with a torn patella tendon in his left knee, which ends his season.

Deuce McAllister <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=235228&>, Reserve RB Updated 09/02/01
McAllister rushed for 108 yards on 19 carries, all in the first half, had a 36-yard punt return in the second half, and caught four passes for 20 yards during Saturday's preseason finale. "That was probably the best he's run the whole year," Saints Head Coach Jim Haslett said. "I don't think he's where he should be yet, but we're just starting to see what he can do." While McAllister won't be the Saints' starting running back likely at all this season, he might be a good insurance policy for Ricky Williams owners in Fantasy leagues.

Packers <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=11&>, Active DT Updated 08/09/01
The Packers signed free agent defensive tackle James Grier on Wednesday and released defensive tackle Carl Bradley. Bradley had arthroscopic knee surgery Tuesday and would have been unavailable to the team for an unspecified amount of time. 

Morten Andersen <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=2440&key=1376&>, Reserve K Updated 11/06/00
Andersen had a dull day Sunday as he did not attempt a field goal in the game against Tampa Bay. He did however manage to kick two extra points. Andersen has made 16-of-22 field goal attempts this season.

>> >>
>> >>1:00  The Nebraska band walks by on the way to the Alamodome.  Again,
we
>> >>hoot and holler like wildmen.  Again, the band doubles back and stops
right
>> >>below us to serenade us, this time, however, with the Nebraska fight
songs.
>> >>  Although somewhat impressed by their spirit and verve, we remain
>> >>convinced that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
>> >>
>> >>1:30  I begin the walk to the Alamodome, somehow managing to stuff the
>> >>"Traveler" and 11 cans of beer into my pants.
>> >>
>> >>1:47  I am in line surrounded by Nebraska fans.  They are taunting me.
I
>> >>am taunting back, still certain that we are going to kick the shit out
of
>> >>Nebraska.  I decide to challenge a particularly vocal Nebraska fan to
play
>> >>what I now call and will forever be remembered as "Cell-Phone Flop
Out."
>> >>Remember flop out for a dollar?  The rules are similar.  I tell this
>> >>Nebraska jackass that if he's so confident in his team, he should "flop
>> >>out" his cell phone RIGHT NOW and make plane reservations to Phoenix
for
>> >>the Fiesta Bowl.   And then I spoke these memorable words:  "And not
those
>> >>damn refundable tickets, either!  You request those non-refundable,
>> >>non-transferrable sons-of-bitches!"   He backs down.  He is unworthy.
I
>> >>call Southwest Airlines and buy two tickets to Phoenix, non-refundable
and
>> >>non-transferrable.  Price:  $712.  He is humbled.  He lowers his head
in
>> >>shame.  I raise my cell phone in triumph to the cheers of hundreds of
Texas
>> >>fans. I am KING and these are my subjects.  I distribute the 11 beers
in my
>> >>pants to the cheering masses.  I RULE the pre-game kingdom.
>> >>
>> >>2:34  Kickoff.  Brimming with confidence, I open the Traveler and pour
my
>> >>first stiffy.
>> >>
>> >>2:45  I notice something troubling:  Nebraska is big.  Nebraska is
fast.
>> >>Nebraska is very pissed off at Texas.
>> >>
>> >>3:01  The first quarter mercifully ends.  9 yards total offense for
Texas.
>> >>Zero first downs for Texas.  I'm still talking shit.  I pour another
stiffy
>> >>from the Traveler.
>> >>
>> >>3:36  Four minutes to go in the first half:  the Traveler is a dead
>> >>soldier.  I buy my first $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants.  While I
am
>> >>standing in line, a center snap nearly decapitates Major Applewhite and
>> >>rolls out of the end zone.  Safety.
>> >>
>> >>3:56  Halftime score:  Nebraska 15, Texas 0.  I wish I had another
>> >>Traveler.
>> >>
>> >>4:11  While urinating next to a Nebraska fan in the bathroom at
halftime, I
>> >>attempt to revive the classic Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:
>> >>"Hey, buddy, niiiiiiiiice cock."  He is unamused.
>> >>
>> >>4:21  I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants.  I
share
>> >>my beer with two high school girls sitting behind me.  Surprisingly,
they
>> >>are equipped with a flask full of vodka.  I send them off to purchase
$5
>> >>Sprites, so that we may consume their vodka.  I have not lost faith.
>> >>Nebraska is a bunch of pussies.
>> >>
>> >>4:51  No more vodka.  The girls sitting behind me have fled for their
>> >>lives.  I purchase two more $5 beers from the Alamodome merchants.
>> >>
>> >>5:18  Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0.  I am beginning to lose faith.
This
>> >>normally would trouble me, but I am too drunk to see the football
field.
>> >>
>> >>5:27  I call Southwest Airlines:  "I'm sorry, sir.  Those tickets have
been
>> >>confirmed and are non-refundable and non-transferrable."
>> >>
>> >>5:37  I try to start a fight with every person behind the concession
>> >>counter.  As it turns out, the Alamodome has a policy that no beer can
be
>> >>sold when there is less than 10 minutes on the game clock.  I am
enraged by
>> >>this policy.  I ask loudly:  "Why the fuck didn't you announce last
call
>> >>over the fucking PA system??!!"
>> >>
>> >>5:49  Back in my seats, I am slumped in my chair in defeat.  All of a
>> >>sudden, the Texas crowd goes absolutely nuts.  "Whazzis?," I mutter,
>> >>awaking from my coma, "Iz we winnig?  Did wez scort?"  Alas, the answer
is
>> >>no, we were not winning and we did not score.  The largest (by far)
cheer
>> >>of the day from the Texas faithful occurred when the handlers were
walking
>> >>back to the tunnel and Bevo stopped to take a gargantuan shit all over
the
>> >>letters "S", "K", and "A" in the "Nebraska" spelled out in their end
zone.
>> >>I cheer wildly.  I pick up the empty Traveler bottle and stick my
tongue in
>> >>it.  I am thirsty.
>> >>
>> >>6:16  Nebraska fans are going berserk as I walk back to the truck.  I
would
>> >>taunt them with some off-color remarks about their parentage, but I am
too
>> >>drunk to form complete sentences.  With my last cognitive thought of
the
>> >>evening, I take solace in the fact that if we had not beaten them in
>> >>October, they would be playing Florida State for the national
championship.
>> >>
>> >>6:30  Back in the car.  On the way back to Austin for the 8:00
>> >>Texas-Arizona tip off.  We can still salvage the day!  I crack open a
beer.
>> >>  It is warm.  I don't care.
>> >>
>> >>7:12  We have stopped for gas.  I am hungry.  I go inside the store.  I
>> >>walk past the beer frig.  I notice a Zima.  I've never had a Zima.  I
>> >>wonder if it's any good.  I pull a Zima from the frig.  I twist the top
off
>> >>and drink the Zima in three swallows.  Zima sucks.  I replace the empty
>> >>bottle in the frig.
>> >>
>> >>7:17  There is a Blimpie Subs in the store.  I walk to where the
>> >>ingredients are, where the person usually makes the sub.  There is no
one
>> >>there.  I lean over the counter and scoop out half a bucket of black
>> >>olives.  I eat them.  I am still hungry.  I lean further over the
counter
>> >>and grab approximately two pounds of Pastrami.  I walk out of the store
>> >>grunting and eating Pastrami.  The patrons in the store fear me.  I
don't
>> >>care.
>> >>
>> >>8:01  We are in South Austin.  I have been drinking warm beer and
singing
>> >>Brooks and Dunn tunes for over an hour.  My truck-mate is tired of my
>> >>singing.  He suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn have written other
good
>> >>songs besides "You're Going to Miss Me When I'm Gone" and "Neon Moon"
and
>> >>that maybe listening to only those two songs, ten times each was a bit
>> >>excessive.  Perhaps, he suggests, I could just let the CD play on its
own.
>> >>I tell him to fuck off and restart "Neon Moon."
>> >>
>> >>8:30  We arrive at the Erwin Center.  My truckmate, against my loud and
>> >>profane protestations, parks on the top floor of a nearby parking
garage.
>> >>I tell him he's an idiot.  I tell him we will never get out.  I tell
him we
>> >>may as well pitch a fucking tent here.  He ignores me.  I think he's
still
>> >>pissed about the Brooks and Dunn tunes.  I whistle "Neon Moon" loudly.
>> >>
>> >>8:47  I am rallying.  I have 4 warm beers stuffed in my pants.  We're
going
>> >>to kick the shit out of Arizona.
>> >>
>> >>9:11  Halftime score:  Texas 31, Arizona 29.  I am pleased.  I go to
the
>> >>bathroom to pee for the 67th time today.  I giggle to myself because of
the
>> >>new opportunity to do "the bathroom Brice."  There are no Arizona fans
in
>> >>the bathroom.  I am disappointed.  I tell myself (out loud)  that I
have a
>> >>"Niiiiiice cock."  No one is amused but me.
>> >>
>> >>9:41  I walk to the bathroom while drinking Bud Light out of a can.
>> >>Needless to say, they do not sell beer at the Erwin Center, much less
Bud
>> >>Light out of a can.  I am stopped by an usher:  "Where did you get
that,
>> >>sir?"  I tell him (no shit):  "Oh, the cheerleaders were throwing them
up
>> >>with those little plastic footballs.  Would you mind throwing this away
for
>> >>me?"  I take the last swig and hand it to him.  He is confused.  I
pretend
>> >>I'm going to the bathroom, but I run away giggling instead.  I duck
into
>> >>some entrance to avoid the usher, who is now pursuing me.  I sneak into
a
>> >>large group of people and sit down.  The usher walks by harmlessly.  I
am
>> >>giggling like a little girl.  I crack open another can of Bud Light.
>> >>
>> >>9:52  I am lost.  In my haste to avoid the usher, I have lost my
bearings.
>> >>I have no ticket stub.  I cannot find my seats.  Texas is losing.
>> >>
>> >>10:09  Texas is being screwed by the refs.  I am enraged.  I have
cleared
>> >>out the seats around me because I keep removing my hat and beating the
>> >>surrounding chairs with it.  A concerned fan asks if I'm OK and perhaps
I
>> >>shouldn't take it so seriously.  I tell him to fuck off.
>> >>
>> >>10:15  After the fourth consecutive "worst fucking call I have EVER
seen,"
>> >>I attempt to remove my hat again to begin beating inanimate objects.
>> >>However, on this occasion I miscalculate and I thumbnail myself in my
left
>> >>eyelid, leaving a one-quarter inch gash over my eye.  I am now bleeding
>> >>into my left eye and all over my shirt.  "Perhaps," I think to myself,
"I'm
>> >>taking this a bit seriously."
>> >>
>> >>10:22  I am standing in the bathroom peeing.  I'm so drunk I am swaying
and
>> >>grunting.  I have a bloody napkin pressed on my left eye.  My pants are
>> >>bloody.  I have my (formerly) white shirt wrapped around my waist.  I
look
>> >>like I should be in an episode of Cops.
>> >>
>> >>10:43  Texas has lost.  I put my bloody white shirt back on my body and
>> >>make my way for the exits.  I am stopped every 20 seconds by a good
>> >>samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me why I am covered in blood, but I
>> >>merely grunt incoherently and keep moving.
>> >>
>> >>10:59  With my one good eye, I have located the parking garage.  I walk
up
>> >>six flights of stairs, promise that when I see my friend I will punch
him
>> >>in the face for making me walk up six flights of stairs, find the
truck,
>> >>and collapse in a heap in the bed of the truck.  I look around and
notice
>> >>that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole
flights,
>> >>and no one is moving.  I take a nap.
>> >>
>> >>11:17  I awake from my nap.  I see my friend in the driver's seat.  I
lift
>> >>my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is
lined
>> >>up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is
moving.
>> >>I am too tired to punch my friend.  I call my friend a "Stupid
cocksucker."
>> >>
>> >>11:31  I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
>> >>traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights,
and

>> >>

and

>> >>
>> >>11:58  I am jostled.  The truck is moving.  I lift my head to look out
the
>> >>bed of the truck and notice that traffic is beginning to move on the
second
>> >>floor.  I jump out of the truck, walk to the edge of the parking
facility,
>> >>and pee off the sixth floor onto the street below.  My friend looks at
me
>> >>like I just anally violated his minor sister.  I turn around and pee on
the
>> >>front of his truck while singing the lyrics to "Neon Moon."
>> >>
>> >>12:11  We are moving.  We are out of beer.  I jump from the truck and
go
>> >>from vehicle to vehicle until someone gives me two beers.  I am happy.
I
>> >>return to my vehicle.
>> >>
>> >>12:26  We have emerged from the parking facility.  We make our way to
my
>> >>apartment and find Ed sitting on the couch with a freshly opened bottle
of
>> >>Glenlivet on the coffee table in front of him.  We are all going to die
>> >>tonight.
>> >>
>> >>12:59  We have finished three-quarters of the bottle of Glenlivet.  We

has

full

pieces.
>> >>We giggle uncontrollably and leave for PollyEsther's.
>> >>
>> >>1:17  The PollyEsther's doorman laughs uncontrollably at our efforts to

laughter,

doors in

Dilbert Newsletter 29.0
------------------------

To:     Dogbert's New Ruling Class (DNRC)
From:   Scott Adams (scottadams@aol.com)
Date:   February 2000



   Highlights:
  ------------------------------------------------
  - Stop the Vote Campaign
  - Dilbert TV Show Update
  - True Tales of Induhviduals
  - Dogbert Answers My Mail
  - Dilberitos
  ------------------------------------------------


Stop the Vote Campaign
----------------------

It's a presidential election year in the United States, and that
means it's time for me to "get involved."

This year I'm organizing a "Stop The Vote" campaign aimed at
preventing Induhviduals from casting ballots.  I'll borrow a
strategy used by all politicians: hallucinations of what the
Founding Fathers intended.

As you know, people were very wise in the 1700s. Unfortunately,
something happened that made us all idiots.  I blame television.
That's why we prefer to make our important decisions on personal
freedom based on the wisdom of dead, slave-owning dandies instead
of using our own defective brains.

We have no recordings of the Constitutional debates, but I'm sure
it went something like this:

---- Re-creation ----

Jefferson:  We haven't put anything in the Bill of Rights about
genetic manipulation, Internet encryption, in vitro fertilization,
or mandatory drug testing.

Adams: Just say "et cetera."  No one is going to read it anyway.

Hancock: Let's include something to encourage public nudity.  Cable
TV won't be invented for years and I can't wait that long.

Jefferson:  Okay.  I'll call that the right to bare arms.

Franklin:  That might be misinterpreted.

Jefferson:  Who's the world-class writer here?  I keep your stupid
Almanac next to my chamber pot, and I don't mean for the reading.

Franklin:  I am soooo sorry for making a suggestion.  By the way,
your house slave "Jeff" has your eyes.

All:  HA HA HA HA HA HA!!!

Adams:  You're all a bunch of asses.  I think you're giving me an
embolism.

Jefferson:  You have the right to ass-embolisms.  Hey, maybe I
should include that.  How do you spell it?




Dilbert TV Show Update
----------------------

According to my e-mail, many Dilbert TV fans tape the show so they
have permanent copies in their tape libraries.  While Dilbert is
being taped, they watch other shows that are not tape-worthy.
Unfortunately, only live viewing of TV shows counts for ratings.
This isn't a problem for some TV shows, like "Wheel of Fortune,"
because their viewers use VCRs to crack nuts.  But the mathematical
sets of "people who can program VCRs" and "people most likely to
watch 'Dilbert'" are almost the same.  This has been a problem.

The episode airing February 22nd (9:30 PM EST) in the USA will
probably determine whether the Dilbert show gets renewed.  That's
the episode featuring Jerry Seinfeld as the voice of Comp-U-Comp,
an evil computer who has taken over a company and fired everyone
except the guy who guards the electrical plug.  Eugene Levy plays
the plug guard.

Jerry's lines are mostly written by Larry Charles, one of the
original writers for Seinfeld, now Executive Producer for Dilbert.
So if you liked Seinfeld, this is the closest thing you're going to
get.

And if you know any Induhviduals who are in Nielsen families this
month, please tell them that there's some sort of "millionaire
prize" for watching "Dilbert" and answering questions posed by the
voices in their own heads.


Dilbert Episode Airs On the Internet
------------------------------------

As part of our overall pimping for the Seinfeld voice episode,
we're putting an entire show (The Merger episode) on the Internet
in streaming video, starting February 17th and running through
February 29th.  You can find links to it at
www.dilbertondemand.com.  You need the Windows Media Player, which
you can download from the site.

As far as we know, this is the first television cartoon show
streamed over the Internet in its entirety.  We made sure we didn't
research that fact too thoroughly so we could honestly say, "as far
as we know."

You'll need a reasonably fast connection, but you can view the
entire show, in bite-sized chunks, at your leisure.  Don't settle
for mere bragging about your DSL or cable modem connection;
DEMONSTRATE your digital superiority!  Invite a neighbor who has a
pitiful 28.8 modem over to drool on you.  If you wear a raincoat,
it's a strangely satisfying experience and you can hose it off
later.

If you know anyone recently involved in a merger, the Dilbert
episode on the Internet (The Merger) is the one they'll want to
see.  Find out what's in store for companies who seek "synergy."


True Tales of Induhviduals
--------------------------

I begin the True Tales section with a personal sighting.  I
recently came upon a local road that was closed for improvements.
Signs warned "Road Closed" and "Bridge Out."  As I turned around to
head for the detour, another motorist waved me down.  We rolled
down our windows and he shouted, "Do you think we should just move
the barricades and go for it?"

I don't know how fast one must drive in order to compensate for a
"Bridge Out" situation, but I decided not to try it.


True Tale 2
-----------

Some of our corporate policies have been rewritten.  Here's an
example from our expense reporting procedures.

"Receipts are required for all expenditures of $25 or more and, in
addition to this, receipts for a lesser amount are also required."

Editor's note: It sounds as if some of the people in the HR are
idiots and, in addition to this, the rest of them are too.


True Tale 3
-----------


We received a letter from the Environmental Protection Agency
stating that unless we provided answers to their outstanding
questions within two weeks they would recommend that our power
plant construction project not proceed.

Apparently they failed to notice that, a) we already answered the
questions, b) their approval had already been issued and, c) the
$600 million power plant had been built nearly two years ago.

Editor's note: If those are the sort of questions the EPA calls
"outstanding" I'd hate to hear their dumb ones.


True Tale 4
-----------

We had a Christmas raffle in the "Business Intelligence"
department.   The boss drew a number and called it out.   The
department statistician stood up to tumultuous applause and went up
to collect his prize.  Meanwhile, another employee -- who turned
out to be the real winner -- stood up to collect that same prize.
Upon investigation, the statistician for Business Intelligence had
confused ticket 593 for 539.

Editor's note: On the surface it looks as if the statistician is a
boob.  But he's the only one in the room who realized that 39% of
the time the real winner isn't present to win.  I suspect he's a
DNRC member just playing the odds.


True Tale 5
-----------

When a project is finished in my department we place a red dot
sticker on the folder to signify its completion.  One day we ran
out of red dots but still had a large supply of green and blue
dots.  Dots weren't used for any other purpose so I suggested using
the ones we have, despite their non-red color.  Color was
insignificant.  There were only five of us in the group, so
communicating the change would be easy.

My money-saving suggestion was met with resistance from cow-orkers.
 They pointed out that we've "always used RED dots" and maybe I
should check with the department manager.  I mentioned my idea to
the manager and he said I should "bring it up at the next staff
meeting."

Editor's note: Ironically, it's not a dot.com company.


True Tale 6
-----------

I paid for lunch with a credit card.  The manager put it through
the electronic card machine and got a "no dial tone" error.  She
tried again with the same result.  Then she asked me if I had
another card.

Editor's note:  That's exactly why you should pay for your lunch
using a phone company calling card.  They have dial tone.


True Tale 7
-----------

We tested our Y2K power contingency plans a few weeks before New
Year's.  The Induhviduals in IT didn't expect any downtime, so the
test was performed during the normal work day.  The idea was that
when power was cut, the six generators would kick on and we
wouldn't notice a thing.

Three generators failed to start. Two threw their breakers due to
the high load on them.  The last was overwhelmed when the previous
two cut out and threw a tremendous surge through the lines, blowing
up hundreds of light bulbs, frying fax machines, radios and pencil
sharpeners along the way.   The surge jumped circuits in our
industrial level surge protector and traveled through our "surge
protected" lines to every desktop in the company plus the server
room.  After taking out over a hundred monitors and almost forty
PCs, the surge proceeded to destroy our server room air
conditioner, four huge UPS systems, thirteen servers and both
AS/400s.  Several small fires started throughout the building,
including our now half-melted Christmas tree and our
molten-menorah.

The surge then jumped the lines into the main power grid, blowing
up two transformers, one of which fell on the IT manager's car
(poetic justice) and cutting power on the entire block.  The
remaining generator then proceeded to burst into flames, eventually
blowing up all six generators and burning up seven cars.

This all occurred within about thirty seconds and sent 38 people to
the hospital, cost the company over $650,000 in equipment (not to
mention the impending lawsuits), destroyed eight cars and caused
weeks of downtime.  Three people quit the company.  One woman is
still in the hospital with electrical burns.  The resulting
publicity got us on television in five states.


Editor's note: That story sounds too amazing to be true but I'm
printing it anyway under the theory that there's no such thing as
bad publicity.


True Tale 8
-----------

Our university library just got new computers. The library
thoughtfully provided headphones so students can listen to sound
files without disturbing anyone nearby.   The problem is the
headphone cords have been clamped to the desk in such a way that in
order to use them, you must have your head no more than six inches
from your keyboard. It is great fun to see the stu-duh-nts trying
to use them.


True Tale 9
-----------

I went to a Georgia DMV office to obtain a driver's license.
Customers are required to produce two pieces of ID.  I presented a
utility bill and a copy of my latest tax return, both acceptable
types of ID according to their published list.

The agent behind the counter said she could not accept my tax
return as ID because it was typed.  She said, "How do we know this
is legitimate?  Anyone can get a computer or typewriter to produce
this return."  I argued, unsuccessfully, that it was also easy to
obtain pens and pencils to create hand-written returns.  I was told
to come back with a hand-written return or another acceptable form
of ID.


True Tale 10
------------

I went to a fast-food restaurant one morning for breakfast.  The
moment I opened the door, I was almost swept off my feet by an
overpowering odor of gas.  I struggled up to the counter out of a
vague sense of duty, and said  "You've got an enormous gas leak
back there somewhere!" gesturing towards the kitchen.

The girl behind the counter shrugged and said, "Yeah, I know, but
I've been here since seven o'clock and I've gotten used to it."


True Tale 11
------------

I went to ask our new principal if we could have the Monday before
finals off as a study day.  We had always gotten a study day in the
past but it wasn't on the schedule this time.  He thought for a
second and then responded, "No, you have school that day."

True Tale 12
------------

About a year ago I went to buy a video for a friend's birthday.
The video was rated for adult viewing only.   I was 15 years old,
but they sold it to me anyway.

When I got home I found out that my friend wanted the sequel, not
the original, so I took it back to the store.  The video clerk said
he couldn't return the video because I didn't look 18.

I was confused, so I attempted to clarify.  "So, because I don't
look 18 you're going to MAKE me take this ADULT-rated video, rather
then let me change it for the sequel that is NOT ADULT-rated?"

"Yeah, it's company policy.  If it changes we'll be in touch."

Eventually I convinced him he was breaking the law by selling me
the adult video instead of letting me exchange it for the non-adult
one.   As I left, the guy behind the counter yelled at me, "Next
time, don't watch the video first!"

It was still in its shrink-wrap.




Dogbert Answers My Mail
-----------------------

In this section, Dogbert answers my mail.  These are based on real
e-mail to me.  Some names have been changed to make them easier to
mock.



Dear Mr. Adams,

You were duped in your last newsletter.   Someone submitted a
supposedly True Tale of Induhviduals about a little boy and a
pager.  That is actually an urban legend more than twenty years
old.  Shame on you for falling for that.

        Jim,


Dear Chimp,

Just because it's an urban legend doesn't mean it didn't happen.
In fact, just this morning Mr. Adams woke up in a bathtub full of
ice and found a note saying one of his kidneys was missing.  It
wasn't stolen; he got talked into donating it to a celebrity
auction for the National Ear Hair Foundation.  I'm working with him
on learning to say no.

        Sincerely,

        Dogbert

asterisks)


Dear Mr. Adams,

Your stupid ******* comic strip is a piece of ****.  Give up
cartooning and **** my ****, you *******  ****-******.

        (Anonymous)




Dear Esophagus,

There is no call for such language.  If you do it again, it will be
your "*."

       Sincerely,


       Dogbert

Dear Mr. Adams,

No offense, but no one will cry when you die because Dilbert is
just some goofy guy. Some of the biussness (sic) stuff is HARD to
understand and it isn't something that you can feel like you know.
Dogbert is so egotistical whereas Snoopy is so easy to know, and
Charlie Brown is not some GOOFY guy, if you know what I mean.

      Marshall



Dear Marsupial,

No offense taken. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to
"buissness."


      Sincerely,


      Dogbert

---


Dear Mr. Adams,

What is that round black thing on Dogbert's face?  My friend says
it's his mouth but I say it's his nose.

      Floyd



Dear Flawed,

I get this question often, thanks to Mr. Adams' prodigious artistic
range.  Allow me to clarify some of the shapes in the Dilbert
strip.  In general, the black circles are dog noses.  The black
ovals are mouths.  Rectangles are desks or sometimes computers. 
When the ovals are turned the other way and are not filled with
black they are glasses.  Everything else is random.

I have already requested a transfer to "For Better or For Worse."
The dog mortality rate there is high, but I'm willing to take the
chance.


      Sincerely,


      Dogbert



Dilberitos
----------

If you're wondering where to find those delicious and
coincidentally-vegetarian Dilberitos that have 100% of your daily
values of vitamins and minerals, they're in grocery stores now, in
the frozen food section.  Check www.dilberito.com for store
details.

I can't guarantee that eating Dilberitos will help you live long
enough to dance on the graves of all your enemies (an excellent
aerobic exercise), but it's worth a try.


Dilbert Fodder
---------------

What's bugging you about your job?  Let me know and you might see
it in a Dilbert comic, TV show or newsletter.  The best comic
fodder involves workplace peeves, devious strategies, frustrations
of dealing with others, conflicting objectives, unintended
management consequences, and of course my favorite - idiot bosses.

And I love True Tales of Induhviduals.

And if you're seeing any new management trends that need to be
mocked, I can help.  Send your suggestions to me at
scottadams@aol.com.  Short ones are better.

Cubicle Art
-----------

The Dilbert Zone is now accepting submissions of cubicle art: art
made from things you have around the office, or decorated cubes, or
"theme" cubes. Toward the end of March, the best ones will be
posted in the DNRC area at www.dilbert.com. Submissions will only
be accepted by e-mail, and must be in gif or jpg format, 50K or
less. E-mail cubicle art submissions to cubeart@unitedmedia.com.

All submissions will be governed by the terms of use posted at

Dilbert Newsletter 29.0
------------------------

To:     Dogbert's New Ruling Class (DNRC)
From:   Scott Adams (scottadams@aol.com)
Date:   February 2000



   Highlights:
  ------------------------------------------------
  - Stop the Vote Campaign
  - Dilbert TV Show Update
  - True Tales of Induhviduals
  - Dogbert Answers My Mail
  - Dilberitos
  ------------------------------------------------


Stop the Vote Campaign
----------------------

It's a presidential election year in the United States, and that
means it's time for me to "get involved."

This year I'm organizing a "Stop The Vote" campaign aimed at
preventing Induhviduals from casting ballots.  I'll borrow a
strategy used by all politicians: hallucinations of what the
Founding Fathers intended.

As you know, people were very wise in the 1700s. Unfortunately,
something happened that made us all idiots.  I blame television.
That's why we prefer to make our important decisions on personal
freedom based on the wisdom of dead, slave-owning dandies instead
of using our own defective brains.

We have no recordings of the Constitutional debates, but I'm sure
it went something like this:

---- Re-creation ----

Jefferson:  We haven't put anything in the Bill of Rights about
genetic manipulation, Internet encryption, in vitro fertilization,
or mandatory drug testing.

Adams: Just say "et cetera."  No one is going to read it anyway.

Hancock: Let's include something to encourage public nudity.  Cable
TV won't be invented for years and I can't wait that long.

Jefferson:  Okay.  I'll call that the right to bare arms.

Franklin:  That might be misinterpreted.

Jefferson:  Who's the world-class writer here?  I keep your stupid
Almanac next to my chamber pot, and I don't mean for the reading.

Franklin:  I am soooo sorry for making a suggestion.  By the way,
your house slave "Jeff" has your eyes.

All:  HA HA HA HA HA HA!!!

Adams:  You're all a bunch of asses.  I think you're giving me an
embolism.

Jefferson:  You have the right to ass-embolisms.  Hey, maybe I
should include that.  How do you spell it?




Dilbert TV Show Update
----------------------

According to my e-mail, many Dilbert TV fans tape the show so they
have permanent copies in their tape libraries.  While Dilbert is
being taped, they watch other shows that are not tape-worthy.
Unfortunately, only live viewing of TV shows counts for ratings.
This isn't a problem for some TV shows, like "Wheel of Fortune,"
because their viewers use VCRs to crack nuts.  But the mathematical
sets of "people who can program VCRs" and "people most likely to
watch 'Dilbert'" are almost the same.  This has been a problem.

The episode airing February 22nd (9:30 PM EST) in the USA will
probably determine whether the Dilbert show gets renewed.  That's
the episode featuring Jerry Seinfeld as the voice of Comp-U-Comp,
an evil computer who has taken over a company and fired everyone
except the guy who guards the electrical plug.  Eugene Levy plays
the plug guard.

Jerry's lines are mostly written by Larry Charles, one of the
original writers for Seinfeld, now Executive Producer for Dilbert.
So if you liked Seinfeld, this is the closest thing you're going to
get.

And if you know any Induhviduals who are in Nielsen families this
month, please tell them that there's some sort of "millionaire
prize" for watching "Dilbert" and answering questions posed by the
voices in their own heads.


Dilbert Episode Airs On the Internet
------------------------------------

As part of our overall pimping for the Seinfeld voice episode,
we're putting an entire show (The Merger episode) on the Internet
in streaming video, starting February 17th and running through
February 29th.  You can find links to it at
www.dilbertondemand.com.  You need the Windows Media Player, which
you can download from the site.

As far as we know, this is the first television cartoon show
streamed over the Internet in its entirety.  We made sure we didn't
research that fact too thoroughly so we could honestly say, "as far
as we know."

You'll need a reasonably fast connection, but you can view the
entire show, in bite-sized chunks, at your leisure.  Don't settle
for mere bragging about your DSL or cable modem connection;
DEMONSTRATE your digital superiority!  Invite a neighbor who has a
pitiful 28.8 modem over to drool on you.  If you wear a raincoat,
it's a strangely satisfying experience and you can hose it off
later.

If you know anyone recently involved in a merger, the Dilbert
episode on the Internet (The Merger) is the one they'll want to
see.  Find out what's in store for companies who seek "synergy."


True Tales of Induhviduals
--------------------------

I begin the True Tales section with a personal sighting.  I
recently came upon a local road that was closed for improvements.
Signs warned "Road Closed" and "Bridge Out."  As I turned around to
head for the detour, another motorist waved me down.  We rolled
down our windows and he shouted, "Do you think we should just move
the barricades and go for it?"

I don't know how fast one must drive in order to compensate for a
"Bridge Out" situation, but I decided not to try it.


True Tale 2
-----------

Some of our corporate policies have been rewritten.  Here's an
example from our expense reporting procedures.

"Receipts are required for all expenditures of $25 or more and, in
addition to this, receipts for a lesser amount are also required."

Editor's note: It sounds as if some of the people in the HR are
idiots and, in addition to this, the rest of them are too.


True Tale 3
-----------


We received a letter from the Environmental Protection Agency
stating that unless we provided answers to their outstanding
questions within two weeks they would recommend that our power
plant construction project not proceed.

Apparently they failed to notice that, a) we already answered the
questions, b) their approval had already been issued and, c) the
$600 million power plant had been built nearly two years ago.

Editor's note: If those are the sort of questions the EPA calls
"outstanding" I'd hate to hear their dumb ones.


True Tale 4
-----------

We had a Christmas raffle in the "Business Intelligence"
department.   The boss drew a number and called it out.   The
department statistician stood up to tumultuous applause and went up
to collect his prize.  Meanwhile, another employee -- who turned
out to be the real winner -- stood up to collect that same prize.
Upon investigation, the statistician for Business Intelligence had
confused ticket 593 for 539.

Editor's note: On the surface it looks as if the statistician is a
boob.  But he's the only one in the room who realized that 39% of
the time the real winner isn't present to win.  I suspect he's a
DNRC member just playing the odds.


True Tale 5
-----------

When a project is finished in my department we place a red dot
sticker on the folder to signify its completion.  One day we ran
out of red dots but still had a large supply of green and blue
dots.  Dots weren't used for any other purpose so I suggested using
the ones we have, despite their non-red color.  Color was
insignificant.  There were only five of us in the group, so
communicating the change would be easy.

My money-saving suggestion was met with resistance from cow-orkers.
 They pointed out that we've "always used RED dots" and maybe I
should check with the department manager.  I mentioned my idea to
the manager and he said I should "bring it up at the next staff
meeting."

Editor's note: Ironically, it's not a dot.com company.


True Tale 6
-----------

I paid for lunch with a credit card.  The manager put it through
the electronic card machine and got a "no dial tone" error.  She
tried again with the same result.  Then she asked me if I had
another card.

Editor's note:  That's exactly why you should pay for your lunch
using a phone company calling card.  They have dial tone.


True Tale 7
-----------

We tested our Y2K power contingency plans a few weeks before New
Year's.  The Induhviduals in IT didn't expect any downtime, so the
test was performed during the normal work day.  The idea was that
when power was cut, the six generators would kick on and we
wouldn't notice a thing.

Three generators failed to start. Two threw their breakers due to
the high load on them.  The last was overwhelmed when the previous
two cut out and threw a tremendous surge through the lines, blowing
up hundreds of light bulbs, frying fax machines, radios and pencil
sharpeners along the way.   The surge jumped circuits in our
industrial level surge protector and traveled through our "surge
protected" lines to every desktop in the company plus the server
room.  After taking out over a hundred monitors and almost forty
PCs, the surge proceeded to destroy our server room air
conditioner, four huge UPS systems, thirteen servers and both
AS/400s.  Several small fires started throughout the building,
including our now half-melted Christmas tree and our
molten-menorah.

The surge then jumped the lines into the main power grid, blowing
up two transformers, one of which fell on the IT manager's car
(poetic justice) and cutting power on the entire block.  The
remaining generator then proceeded to burst into flames, eventually
blowing up all six generators and burning up seven cars.

This all occurred within about thirty seconds and sent 38 people to
the hospital, cost the company over $650,000 in equipment (not to
mention the impending lawsuits), destroyed eight cars and caused
weeks of downtime.  Three people quit the company.  One woman is
still in the hospital with electrical burns.  The resulting
publicity got us on television in five states.


Editor's note: That story sounds too amazing to be true but I'm
printing it anyway under the theory that there's no such thing as
bad publicity.


True Tale 8
-----------

Our university library just got new computers. The library
thoughtfully provided headphones so students can listen to sound
files without disturbing anyone nearby.   The problem is the
headphone cords have been clamped to the desk in such a way that in
order to use them, you must have your head no more than six inches
from your keyboard. It is great fun to see the stu-duh-nts trying
to use them.


True Tale 9
-----------

I went to a Georgia DMV office to obtain a driver's license.
Customers are required to produce two pieces of ID.  I presented a
utility bill and a copy of my latest tax return, both acceptable
types of ID according to their published list.

The agent behind the counter said she could not accept my tax
return as ID because it was typed.  She said, "How do we know this
is legitimate?  Anyone can get a computer or typewriter to produce
this return."  I argued, unsuccessfully, that it was also easy to
obtain pens and pencils to create hand-written returns.  I was told
to come back with a hand-written return or another acceptable form
of ID.


True Tale 10
------------

I went to a fast-food restaurant one morning for breakfast.  The
moment I opened the door, I was almost swept off my feet by an
overpowering odor of gas.  I struggled up to the counter out of a
vague sense of duty, and said  "You've got an enormous gas leak
back there somewhere!" gesturing towards the kitchen.

The girl behind the counter shrugged and said, "Yeah, I know, but
I've been here since seven o'clock and I've gotten used to it."


True Tale 11
------------

I went to ask our new principal if we could have the Monday before
finals off as a study day.  We had always gotten a study day in the
past but it wasn't on the schedule this time.  He thought for a
second and then responded, "No, you have school that day."

True Tale 12
------------

About a year ago I went to buy a video for a friend's birthday.
The video was rated for adult viewing only.   I was 15 years old,
but they sold it to me anyway.

When I got home I found out that my friend wanted the sequel, not
the original, so I took it back to the store.  The video clerk said
he couldn't return the video because I didn't look 18.

I was confused, so I attempted to clarify.  "So, because I don't
look 18 you're going to MAKE me take this ADULT-rated video, rather
then let me change it for the sequel that is NOT ADULT-rated?"

"Yeah, it's company policy.  If it changes we'll be in touch."

Eventually I convinced him he was breaking the law by selling me
the adult video instead of letting me exchange it for the non-adult
one.   As I left, the guy behind the counter yelled at me, "Next
time, don't watch the video first!"

It was still in its shrink-wrap.




Dogbert Answers My Mail
-----------------------

In this section, Dogbert answers my mail.  These are based on real
e-mail to me.  Some names have been changed to make them easier to
mock.



Dear Mr. Adams,

You were duped in your last newsletter.   Someone submitted a
supposedly True Tale of Induhviduals about a little boy and a
pager.  That is actually an urban legend more than twenty years
old.  Shame on you for falling for that.

        Jim,


Dear Chimp,

Just because it's an urban legend doesn't mean it didn't happen.
In fact, just this morning Mr. Adams woke up in a bathtub full of
ice and found a note saying one of his kidneys was missing.  It
wasn't stolen; he got talked into donating it to a celebrity
auction for the National Ear Hair Foundation.  I'm working with him
on learning to say no.

        Sincerely,

        Dogbert


----

(Note:  In this next letter, some expletives have been replaced by
asterisks)


Dear Mr. Adams,

Your stupid ******* comic strip is a piece of ****.  Give up
cartooning and **** my ****, you *******  ****-******.

        (Anonymous)




Dear Esophagus,

There is no call for such language.  If you do it again, it will be
your "*."

       Sincerely,


       Dogbert


---


Dear Mr. Adams,

No offense, but no one will cry when you die because Dilbert is
just some goofy guy. Some of the biussness (sic) stuff is HARD to
understand and it isn't something that you can feel like you know.
Dogbert is so egotistical whereas Snoopy is so easy to know, and
Charlie Brown is not some GOOFY guy, if you know what I mean.

      Marshall



Dear Marsupial,

No offense taken. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to
"buissness."


      Sincerely,


      Dogbert

---


Dear Mr. Adams,

What is that round black thing on Dogbert's face?  My friend says
it's his mouth but I say it's his nose.

      Floyd



Dear Flawed,

I get this question often, thanks to Mr. Adams' prodigious artistic
range.  Allow me to clarify some of the shapes in the Dilbert
strip.  In general, the black circles are dog noses.  The black
ovals are mouths.  Rectangles are desks or sometimes computers. 
When the ovals are turned the other way and are not filled with
black they are glasses.  Everything else is random.

I have already requested a transfer to "For Better or For Worse."
The dog mortality rate there is high, but I'm willing to take the
chance.


      Sincerely,


      Dogbert



Dilberitos
----------

If you're wondering where to find those delicious and
coincidentally-vegetarian Dilberitos that have 100% of your daily
values of vitamins and minerals, they're in grocery stores now, in
the frozen food section.  Check www.dilberito.com for store
details.

I can't guarantee that eating Dilberitos will help you live long
enough to dance on the graves of all your enemies (an excellent
aerobic exercise), but it's worth a try.


Dilbert Fodder
---------------

What's bugging you about your job?  Let me know and you might see
it in a Dilbert comic, TV show or newsletter.  The best comic

And I love True Tales of Induhviduals.

And if you're seeing any new management trends that need to be
mocked, I can help.  Send your suggestions to me at
scottadams@aol.com.  Short ones are better.

DNRC Update
-----------

The DNRC has a whopping 330,000 members, each one so shockingly
attractive and intelligent that he or she can be used as a
defibrillator.  If you see someone whose heart has stopped, yell
"clear" then press your hands on the person's chest (do not make
the "honk-honk" sound if the victim is female) then start telling a
witty joke.  This method has never actually started anyone's heart,
but sometimes the bystanders get a kick out of it.

After Dogbert conquers the world you will have dominion over the
so-called In-duh-viduals. A DNRC member suggests that Induhviduals
above the age of 18 be called adolts.  I like that.  I propose that
the ones under 18 be called juvenile duh-linquents.


Dilbert by E-mail Program
-------------------------

By popular demand, Dilbert strips can now be delivered to you by
e-mail every day (Monday - Saturday). If your evil employer is
monitoring your web use, this is the answer for you.  Start every

Shakespeare Hoax
----------------

I have come to the unsettling realization that Shakespeare was an
Induhvidual.  In case you haven't read any Shakespeare since you
were a gullible child, here's a little sampling of the Great Bard's
work from Macbeth:

-- start --

"That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold;
What hath quench'd them hath given me fire.
Hark! Peace!
It was the owl that shriek'd, the fatal bellman,
Which gives the stern'st good-night. He is about it:
The doors are open; and the surfeited grooms
Do mock their charge with snores: I have drugg'd their possets,
That death and nature do contend about them,
Whether they live or die."

-- end --

Now, maybe someone drugg'd my posset, but I'm fairly certain that
none of that makes any sense.

When I was a kid, if something made no sense to me, I assumed the
problem was on my end. But now that I am an adult, and I know
everything there is to know, I realize that the source of most
confusion is Induhviduals - sometimes economists, occasionally
poltergeists, but mostly Induhviduals.

Maybe the word "bard" meant something different a few hundred years
ago and that's what caused the confusion - as in, "He was so full
of bard you could grow squash in his earholes."

Or maybe some Irish people attended Shakespeare's plays and said
they were BORED, but it came out sounding like BARD to the English.
That could've happened.

There's really no excuse for Shakespeare's shoddy work.  If you
were Shakespeare, and you had nothing to do all day but sit around
in huge pants and write plays, don't you think you could at least
make them comprehensible?  To me, that seems like the minimum
requirement for a play: The audience should have a vague idea of
what the actors are saying.

I'm certain that the fans of Shakespeare will tell me I would enjoy
his work if only I took the time to understand it.  But that's like
saying I would love polka music if I took the time to translate it
in my head into the sound of a band I like.

I guess I just expect more from my bards.


Induhvidual Debating Technique
------------------------------

Lately I have found myself in e-mail discussions with Induhviduals
who employ debating tactics that are very similar.  I suspect they
are learning these methods in some sort of top-secret Induhvidual
training facility.

The Induhvidual debating technique involves four steps:

1.    Exaggerate your opponent's statement into an absurd absolute.

2.    Make an inappropriate analogy.
3.    Change the topic to something easier to defend.
4.    Claim victory.

For example:


Me:           Vegetables are good for you.

Induhvidual:  That's ridiculous.  If you ate a truckload of
              vegetables all at once you would die.

Me:           No one eats a truckload all at once.

Induhvidual:  Let me give you an analogy. If you tried to swim
              across the ocean, and you didn't know how to swim,
              and you had no arms or legs, you'd never make it.
              Surely you can agree with that.

Me:           Um...that's different.

Induhvidual:  Ha!  So now you agree with me that swimming is good
              exercise!

The worst part is that not only will you be frustrated at your
inability to make your point, you will be branded as the person who
thinks swimming is bad exercise.



True Tales of Induhviduals
--------------------------

Here are some more True Tales of Induhviduals as reported by
brilliant and observant DNRC members.

True Tale 1
-----------

My company posted a notice next to the time clock.  It said the
company calendar had a typo, that the union-won holiday wasn't
really a holiday at all.  The company blamed the printer for this
mistake.  (Nice try.)

But that's not the funny part.  The first line of the notice said,
"Please Take Notice." So the guy standing next to me took it.


True Tale 2
-----------

There are two doors in the restroom at work.  One is the exit and
the other, on the other side of the room, is a closet.  The closet
door is clearly labeled "closet."

The other day I was using the restroom and I heard an Induhvidual
open a door and exclaim, "Darn it! That's the closet again!"

True Tale 3
-----------

My boss had recently learned how to use spreadsheet software.  He
proudly called me into his office to show me a new trick he'd
learned. At one point during his demonstration he was moving his
mouse toward himself and it reached the edge of his desk. I watched
in amazement as he deftly rolled his mouse around the edge of the
desk and underneath.

I stifled my giggling and politely said, "You know, you don't need
to do that with the mouse." Whereupon he took offense and said, "I
know.  I usually grab a book and put it next to the desk and roll
the mouse onto it, but I just can't reach my books right now."  I
said, "Yeah, that's what I do," and excused myself before I broke a
rib trying not to laugh.

True Tale 4
-----------

I attend one of the top universities in the UK.  My housemate
recently surpassed his usual high standard of stupidity.  He needed
to open a bottle.  After hanging around looking helpless, someone
handed him a wine opener (the corkscrew type) that had a bottle
opener on one end.  My housemate disappeared for five minutes and
reappeared with an apologetic look on his face.  "I've broken it.
I'm sorry."

Under questioning he confessed that he had been trying to screw the
corkscrew through the top of the metal bottle cap.


True Tale 5
-----------

A VP of our company stood up at our company meeting and asked all
employees to look over the new website to make sure it was
"grammerly correct."


True Tale 6
-----------

My friend asked to be moved to a cubicle in a quieter place in the
office and her manager agreed. A couple of days later, the office
manager came by her new cube, distressed. He said that he had
really messed up because he gave her a cube that was too big for
her level/title in the company. Her cube was for a P-2 engineer
while she was only a P-1. The difference in size was only two
inches, but still, something had to be done.

A few days later, the office manager returned and said that to fix
the problem, my friend would be promoted to P-2 so she would then
be in the right size cube.

True Tale 7
-----------

Recently the Southern Hemisphere was treated to a total lunar
eclipse. During this event one Induhvidual standing in my street
suggested that we photograph it. Someone explained that the moon
would be difficult to photograph because it was completely darkened
by the shadow of Earth.  Her response was, "What about if I use the
flash?"

True Tale 8
-----------

A customer returned to our wireless phone store with the phone she
had recently purchased.  She complained that the phone worked fine
for the first two days and then suddenly went dead. I asked her how
long she had charged the battery.  She replied, "What do you mean,
charge?"

Upon further interrogation it became clear that she thought the
one- year warranty on the battery meant it would last that long.


True Tale 9
-----------

This is a True Tale that involves a sign I spotted nailed to a tree
along a dirt road somewhere in Iowa:


          I lost 75 lbs.
          Free Samples!
            555-1212


True Tale 10
------------

I recently went into a pizza shop in Katoomba (near Sydney,
Australia) that advertised, "log fire inside."  Next to the fully
enclosed, glass-fronted firebox was a sign, "Please don't touch the
fire."


True Tale 11
------------

I work at a secure R&D facility in the electronics industry. One
day a sign at the guard's desk located in the front lobby said,
"Guard is on rounds.  Visitors wait here!"

Being an upstanding DNRC member, I took it upon myself to add (in
big, bold letters) "...and don't steal my laptop!!!"


True Tale 12
------------

About four years ago we had a multiple choice test for one of our
digital design subjects.  A friend of mine had no clue in this
subject but could clearly see the answers of the person to his
left. So he copied them.

At the end of the exam we were informed that there were
TWO tests, alternating by row!  He had cheated off the wrong test!

But he got a good grade anyway!!  Why?  Because the person he had
cheated off had cheated off the person sitting next to him! Moral
of the story: Two Induhviduals make a right.


True Tale 13
------------

The other day at the gas station, while waiting in line to pay for
my gas, I commented to another customer how expensive gasoline had
become.  Her reply was, "You know, it doesn't really affect me; I
always put in twenty dollars every time I gas up."

True Tale 14
------------

I was in a meeting with a manager - one of those meetings where the
sole purpose is for her to make a speech and everyone to be
impressed - and she showed an example of how the figures would be
added up. It became apparent that she had no idea how you add or
subtract negative numbers.  I pointed out that the result of her
first example was wrong. What followed was a lively debate on how
you are meant to add or subtract negative numbers.  The prevailing
opinion was that there wasn't just one correct way of doing it, so
all the different manufacturers of calculators went with their own
conventions. I was told that my calculator worked differently than
hers. (And how many meetings have you been to that included a
concurrent test of two calculators?)

The meeting ended with her bemoaning the fact that she wasn't
getting any "buy-in" for her idea. A few days later she received,
anonymously, a picture of Prof. Stephen Hawking, with the caption,
"You must be at least this smart to invent your own branch of
math."

True Tale 15
------------

An Induhvidual in my physics class did his math with a pen. He had
to use lots of Liquid Paper to cover the mistakes. It was
recommended to him that he use a pencil. The next day I saw him
covering his pencil marks with Liquid Paper.


True Tale 16
------------

A few days ago I went to the copy place.  I needed 80 copies. The
guy told me that if I made fewer than 100 copies, each copy would
cost 4 cents. But if I made at least 100 copies I would get the
discounted rate of 2 cents per copy.

I told him to make 80 copies of the front of the document and make
20 copies of the blank back. I could use the blank paper later on
for other purposes. He probably never thought of this situation
before; he gave me an angry look but copied the documents anyway.


True Tale 17
------------

While waiting for a subway train, I overhead a woman complain
about the service: "I leave my apartment every day at the same
time, and every day I'm fifteen minutes late for work."


True Tale 18
------------

This is a direct quote from a newsletter I just received. It is the
summer vacation edition and includes this tip on a list of
"Luggage-Packing Secrets of the Pros."

     "SECRET TIP #3: Double the security of luggage padlocks
     with economical electrical ties. Since they must be cut
     to be removed, they're tamper-evident. (Remember to pack
     scissors!)"


Um...and where do you pack those scissors?


True Tale 19
------------

After pulling a ditsy temp secretary off phone duty (she put my
phone number instead of the caller's on phone messages), I assigned
her to something safe: labeling files.  This task did not include
the filing itself, which would have required a thorough grasp of
the alphabet; it only involved affixing colorful self-adhesive
labels to the outside edge of each file indicating the contract
number. The Induhvidual cheerfully labeled throughout the
afternoon, completing 150 files.  The next day, my regular
secretary asked why our files had been sealed closed with colorful
self-adhesive labels.

True Tale 20
------------

This is one I actually heard several years ago.

      "We've got to separate the weed from the shaft."


Invent Your Own Folk Saying
----------------------------

Sometimes I sit around inventing clever folk sayings in case I ever
need them.  Here are some of the ones I've come up with.  You might
have seen some of these in Dilbert books.

     I was happier than a kitten with a Q-tip.

     He was deader than a shrunken head at a Hackey Sack festival.

     I was busier than a beaver in a coffee lake.

     He changed more times than a baby in a beer-drinking contest.

     I was more nervous than a fan store owner with a comb-over.

     He was tenser than Jesse Jackson on Father's Day.



If you have any good ones of your own, send them to me at
scottadams@aol.com. I'll publish the best ones in the next
newsletter.



Dilberito
---------

I've been reading a lot about Mad Cow disease.  Scientists aren't
sure what's causing it.  My theory is that the cows are mad because
we keep eating them.

The obvious solution is to eat Dilberitos instead.  They're
vegetarian, yummy, and have 100% of your daily values of vitamins
and minerals.  Check Dilberito.com for availability.

If your college cafeteria doesn't carry them yet, see if your
credits can be transferred to someplace that does.

them for brevity.


Screamin' Fork!

A fork that screams whenever you stab your food! Ha ha! Now you'll
think twice about eating that prime rib!

[Editor's note: A fork that oinks would be good for diets.]

Intelligent Coffee Cup
Submitted by Lambertbert

A smart coffee cup with a flexible LCD display around the outside.
A small electronics module in the handle controls the display and
interfaces to your PC to download images and programs.

Now your coffee cup can display your next appointment, the date and
time, today's Dilbert strip, time until next cup of coffee, today's
menu, the webcam at home, etc.

I'd like to see about ten little lights down the right hand side of
traffic lights, that go out one-by-one, to let you know when the
light is going to change to green.

"Best If Used Before" Date for Clothes
Submitted by outoffashion

Men's clothes should have a "best if used before" date so you know
when you're out of style.





Dogbert Answers My Mail
-----------------------

In this section Dogbert answers the mail that I am too polite to
answer myself.  These are all based on real e-mail.  The names have
been changed to make them funnier.


Dear Mr. Adams,

My boyfriend enjoys your comics.  I usually give him Dilbert books
for presents, and I was wondering if you had any books that would
be an appropriate fit for Valentine's Day?



          Heather



Dear Heavybreather,

It's a bit late, but I recommend the latest Dilbert compilation, A
Treasury of Sundays.  If that doesn't put your boyfriend in the
mood for hot love it's probably because you cut your hair short so
you would save time getting ready in the morning.


         Sincerely,


         Dogbert


---


Dear Mr. Adams,

It's been a while since I worked at a company that uses buzzwords
and mission statements.  This one caught me off guard.  I thought
you might know the meaning...

           "OPERATIONALIZING THE STRATEGIES"


          Dennis




Dear Densest,

The phrase OPERATIONALIZING THE STRATEGIES can be understood by
breaking it down into its components:

OPERATIONALIZING = Remove internal organs using sharp instruments

THE = Put them in a paper bag

STRATEGIES = Light on fire, put on neighbor's porch, ring doorbell


         Sincerely,


         Dogbert


--

Dear Mr. Adams,

I have totally missed the humor of today's Dilbert comic.  Please
point me in the direction of the meaning, unless you don't care, in
which case just ignore me. Or have Dogbert insult me in the next
newsletter. That would be neat too.


          Gilbert



Dear Goober,

Please give me your address and I will have the answer delivered to
your house immediately.  Look for it in a flaming paper bag on your
porch.



         Sincerely,


         Dogbert


---

[Note:  I swear this next letter is real.]

Mr. Adams:

I have looked at(read) dilbert for one month and to this day I have
found nothing(and I mean nothing) interlectual or funny about your
column. Are you trying to show us(me) how stupid we are by reading
this trash? Well, you have succeded in that endeavor---- but no
more----I read the comics for entertainment and a good outlook for
the day. Dilbert only diffuses that feeling. Thanks but no thanks,



         G. Hitopoulos





Dear Hippopotamus,

I'm sorry you found nothing interlectual about the Dilbert comic
strip.  Mr. Adams will try harder to succede.

         Sincerely,


         Dogbert




Dilbert Fodder
---------------

What's bugging you about your job?  Let me know and you might see
it in a Dilbert comic or newsletter.  The best comic fodder
involves workplace peeves, devious strategies, frustrations of
dealing with others, conflicting objectives, unintended management
consequences, and of course my favorite - idiot bosses.

And I love True Tales of Induhviduals.

And if you're seeing any new management trends that need to be
mocked, I can help.  Send your suggestions to me at
scottadams@aol.com.  Short ones are better.

Dilbert Newsletter 31.0
------------------------


To:     Dogbert's New Ruling Class (DNRC)
From:   Scott Adams (scottadams@aol.com)
Date:   November 2000



   Highlights:
------------------------------------------------
- How I Spent My Summer Vacation
- True Tales of Induhviduals
- Cat Stretching Video
- Dogbert Answers My Mail
------------------------------------------------


DNRC Update
-----------

Many of you have expressed surprise and outrage that Dogbert was
not in the presidential debates.  That's what you think.  What you
don't realize is that Al Gore is actually a robot, remotely
controlled by Dogbert.  The real Al Gore was abducted months ago
and is being held in a safe place.  The strange thing is that the
real Al Gore is a robot too.



How I Spent My Summer Vacation
------------------------------

This newsletter is a bit late because this year I took my first
vacation ever.  It was a cruise to Alaska.  I will summarize it
here so you don't need to go.

Alaska is a large cold place with approximately six residents who
would inbreed if they found each other more attractive.

There was scenery.

Alaska has bald eagles, which are very rare because of Rogaine(tm).

From the cruise ship you can see bears on the shore.  Bears are
about the size of a pencil eraser, at least the ones I saw.  They
might look bigger up close.

If you wondered where all the senior citizens went, they were on my
cruise ship.  That was fine with me; when I'm in bear country I
like to be surrounded by people who can't outrun me.  And it was
fun to see the bald eagles swooping down to our deck and carrying
off the elderly with their majestic talons.  (Why those elderly
people had majestic talons I'll never know.)

The ship had a gym in the bow, with large windows.  When I used the
exercise bike I pretended that the ship was being powered by my
pedaling.  I almost passed out trying to ram a tugboat.  They are
faster than they look.

The cruise ship had something they call a gambling casino.  It
wasn't the kind where you sometimes get back a small portion of
your money.  But that was okay with me because when you're in the
middle of the ocean, and you're not the designated sailor, shoving
money into a small hole in a colorful blinking box can be loads of
fun.

There was food.

If I left anything out, drop by the house and I'll show you the
pictures.


Cat Stretching
--------------

My cat Sarah used to be short and stubby.  Check out my streaming
home video at Lycos Video Center to see how I upgraded her.  Here's
the URL:

http://video.lycos.com/myvideocenter/viewvmail.asp?vm=338035&e=33KUVI9WUjIaU&r

Pillows
-------

Until I obtained good taste, I thought the proper number of pillows
for a bed was one per head.  It's embarrassing to think how wrong I
was.  Thanks to the help of a professional decorator, and Pam, my
bed now has fifteen pillows.  Six of them are big honkers that look
very impressive until they are thrown on the floor at night.  Four
of them are decorative pillows featuring the cheerful faces of
various dogs; those go on the floor at night too. One pillow is a
log-shaped thing called a bolster; it has no purpose that I can
discern.  Two are "Bucky(tm)" pillows that support one's neck
should that become necessary on an emergency basis.  When not in
use, they go on the floor with the bolster.

And then there are two pillows that can be used for -- of all
things -- your head. Those stay on the bed.

The bedspread somehow transmogrified into something
Frenchy-sounding, called a duvey or doovay or something like that.
It is so heavy that I put a lump of coal under it and I check its
progress every few days.  You can't actually sleep under it,
especially on warm California nights, but it sure is pretty.  That
goes on the floor too.

Thirteen pillows plus the doovay are strewn around the bedroom
floor all day.  I fantasize about someday making the bed just to
see what it would look like.  Or maybe I'll just spend that same
energy building a full-scale replica of Stonehenge.

I am delighted with my cornucopia of bedding because I know that
should those beautiful items somehow find their way from the floor
to the bed, the sight would make even the most jaded observer step
back and say, "Wow.  It must be a pain in the ass to have that many
pillows."



Incompetence Pays
-----------------

A true tale from the field...

My group ordered 14 new workstations for nearly $70,000.  The
contracts person (Induhvidual) responsible for buying the PCs
announced that she was able to negotiate a better price than we had
indicated, saving $14,000 on the purchase.  As a result of the cost
savings, she was granted an award of $7,000, 50% of the cost
savings.  This $7,000 award came out of my group's budget.

When we received the 14 workstations, we discovered how she had
saved the $14,000.  She had removed all the monitors from the
order.  We received 14 computers with no monitors.

We were forced to file a new order for the 14 monitors.  Since the
monitors were not being bought as part of a package, the new price
for the monitors came to $19,000, $5,000 more than our original
order.

The end result was that the $70,000 worth of workstations actually
cost us $82,000, and the Induhvidual was rewarded for her good
work.


Looking Busy
------------

Here's an excellent method for getting paid to do nothing, courtesy
of a devious DNRC member:

Scatter some papers over your desk as though you are working on
them.  Open your middle desk drawer (directly over your lap), place
your favorite magazine in the drawer and spend the next hour
reading it.  Put a pen in one hand and keep that hand in the
drawer.  If someone enters your office, remove the pen from the
drawer and close it in one smooth motion.


Two Dimensional Management
--------------------------

True story: Our senior execs decided they needed to be more
"visible" to the unwashed masses.  The solution: cardboard cutouts
of the VPs and senior VPs in the break rooms.


Induhviduals Speak
------------------

Here are two recent statements, both from the same Induhvidual, as
recorded by a vigilant DNRC member.

"I'm caught between a rock and a stone."

"My son has a huge appetite.  He has a bottomless leg."



Here are some more gems, all uttered by another prolific
Induhvidual.  (I might use some of these myself someday.)


"It's like being a monkey with chickens on your back!"

"Are you too blind to remember?"

"Anyone could go to that person and say, 'I need a bell on the side
of the elephant.'"

"He has too many fingers in the dike."

"It's like an engineer falling out of a building."

"Smooth as pie."

"I have no idea what that is.  Thank goodness we didn't order
three!"

"The active part is there, the proactive is not."

"Same crap, different fork."



Lazy Entrepreneur
-----------------

Did you ever have a great business idea but you were too lazy to do
anything about it?  It's frustrating because other people don't
realize how brilliant you are.  To the ignorant observer it appears
you are sitting on your couch drinking soda, burping, and eating
the remnants of potato chips off your shirt.  You look lazy and
dim-witted when in truth you are lazy and brilliant.  It's totally
unfair.

That's why United Media and I created the Lazy Entrepreneur web
site. It's a message board where you can post your brilliant and
generally impractical ideas.  Or make snide remarks about those who
do.  You'll get all the benefits of displaying your brilliance in a
public forum while using no more energy than it takes to type. And
no one will see the embarrassed look on your face when a stranger
tells you your invention has existed for years and you can buy it
at any Target store.

I seeded the Lazy Entrepreneur with a bunch of my own brilliant and
impractical ideas. For example, I'd like to see a prescription pill
container with a built-in manual dial on the bottom, labeled for
each day of the week, so I can use it to remember if I already took
a pill that day.  If the pill has to be taken twice a day, the dial
would have two positions for each day.  If I had a pill container
like that I could stop worrying whether I took my pill and start
worrying whether I remembered to turn the dial.  For some reason,
that seems better to me.

If you don't want to give away your brilliant ideas, the web site
has information on copyrights, patents, trademarks and the like.

DNRC members will get an exclusive preview of the Lazy
Entrepreneur.  It won't be linked from Dilbert.com until next week,
but you can join in the beta test by following the link below.

You'll have first choice of user names, and your feedback will have
a big impact on upgrades to the site. (If you find anything that
doesn't work, please send the report to
lazye_bugs@unitedmedia.com).

Wise Crack
----------

In a recent Sunday strip, Wally's co-workers held him down while
Catbert branded him with a hot iron.  An eighth of an inch of
Wally's butt crack was visible in the original drawing.  I was
informed that readers would complain that Wally's butt crack was
destroying the moral fiber of the planet, so we removed the butt
crack line from the print version and included it in the web
version.  This allows us to test the idea that exposure to cartoon
butt cracks is bad for children.  In theory, the kids who see the
unedited web version will grow up to be serial killers, marketing
professionals and auditors.  They might even have butt cracks of
their own, possibly using mirrors to ogle them.  Or they might
become butt crack addicts.  Adult magazines might be printed that
feature nothing but one-eighth inch black lines.

The possibilities are frightening.



True Tales of Induhviduals
--------------------------

Those In-duh-viduals continue to amaze and amuse us.  Here now,
some more true tales as reported by DNRC operatives in the field.

True Tale 1
-----------

My boss handed me ten pages of data and asked me to scan them, use
optical character recognition (OCR) to get them into our
spreadsheet software and rearrange the columns to meet his needs.
After several hours spent scanning and fixing OCR errors, I learned
that the spreadsheets had originally been e-mailed to my boss as an
attachment.  It seems that my boss didn't remember how to rearrange
columns using spreadsheet software so he figured it would be
easiest to print the file and have me do it instead.

True Tale 2
-----------
During my recent attempt to get a pay raise, part of the
conversation went like this:

Me:  "I have many more responsibilities than I did when I was first
hired, so you should pay me more."

Pointy-Haired Boss: "No, because if you weren't here, we'd just do
without the extra functions that you're performing, so why should
we pay you to do them?"

True Tale 3
-----------

I'm the webmaster at my company. I asked the PR director to give me
the most up-to-date list of our business locations so I could
update the web. She downloaded my web pages and gave them to me.

True Tale 4
-----------

I was having trouble getting my boss to read my e-mail.  Upon
investigation he told me he got too many messages and couldn't read
them all.  I investigated further and discovered that he was using
the alphabetical sort feature in Outlook, and since my name started
with a "P" he never got down to my e-mails.

True Tale 5
-----------

The following is the real reason dot-coms are burning money.  Our
product development team was meeting with the VP for product
development to unveil our product.  It was fully functional to the
point of beta-testing.  At the conclusion of our presentation, the
VP responded that this was great, since he had been in discussions
with an external IT firm about outsourcing the development.  "Maybe
we'll be able to get them to do it cheaper if they know we already
have a working product."

True Tale 6
-----------

A friend told me that his supervisor permitted the receptionist to
make up lost time on a Saturday, when they are closed.

True Tale 7
-----------

This is the real signature line of every mail one of my bosses
sends:

             (Company name) ... Shiting ideas to solutions


I think he meant shiFting.


True Tale 8
-----------

My high school French teacher isn't the sharpest crayon in the box.
She was playing a French song off the Internet, and the class
wanted to know who the band was. She looked at the computer for a
minute, walked to the chalkboard and promptly wrote: MP3.

True Tale 9
-----------

Sometimes, Induhvidualism can work out for the best.

I work at a movie theatre chain that has been sold to another movie
theatre chain.  Technically, everyone in my company is being laid
off.  Per company policy, all employees will be receiving severance
pay before going back to the *exact same* jobs they had before the
switch.

True Tale 10
-----------

An example from our bright travel department:

"Regarding your travel request for Nashville.  You are looking at a
Southwest flight at 1740.  Would this be a.m. or p.m.?"


True Tale 11
-----------

One day on the way to work my wife and I passed by a park and saw
an Induhvidual cleaning up trash in the park using one of those
"garbage harpoons" and a bucket.

We watched her walk along, picking up garbage and smoking her
cigarette as she went. Just as I started to say how dedicated she
must be for not even stopping her work for a smoke break, she took
the cigarette butt from her mouth and flicked it on the ground and
continued cleaning, leaving the cigarette butt smoldering on the
ground behind her.


True Tale 12
-----------


Here is a wonderful and true story about how the bureaucratic mind
works.

I live in California, and the large building I work in is cooled by
drawing in outside air during the months of June and May. (This
saves lots of money because the huge air conditioner remains off.)

But one June day it was unseasonably hot, so I called the
maintenance department to come and turn on the large roof-mounted
air conditioner.  The following conversation is a jewel.

ME:  It is very hot and uncomfortable in this building.  Will you
please turn on the air conditioning?
 
HER:  Uh, we always leave the air-conditioning off during this
month.

ME:  Yes, I know.  But it is hot outside, and worse inside.

HER:  I am sorry, but this is just part of our yearly program.  We
don't use air conditioning in June.

ME:  But it is getting unbearable in here.

The above exchange was repeated several times, and finally, with
some irritation in her voice, she delivered the following, and hung
up.

HER:  Sir, I am sorry you are uncomfortable over there, but we only
control the air-conditioning; we have no control over the weather!


True Tale 13
-----------

An angry Induhvidual recently accused me of "cheating" at our
various work meetings.  I asked how.  The Induhvidual replied that,
"You always prepare for our meetings and that gives you an unfair
advantage."


Dogbertian Poll
---------------

Dogbert might have inspired this idea.  Someone recently spammed a
bunch of people with a message that asked them to call a 900 number
to vote on the issue of whether spam was a good thing or a bad
thing.  It only cost you $1.50 per minute to complain about spam.



Dogbert Answers My Mail
-----------------------

In this section Dogbert answers the mail that I am too polite to
answer myself.  These are all based on real e-mail.  The names have
been changed to make them funnier.

Dear Mr. Adams,

I am studying Social Communication in Argentine.  I wonder if you
could send by e-mail all the information about people who work in
offices, the relationship between them and the work environment and
also about office design.

I wish you could send all the information you can get by e-mail
otherwise you can send me a list of bibliography to search
information about the topics in Spanish.

I beg you to answer in a short time, my e-mail.

Romero


Dear Remora,

I'm glad you begged.  People in the United States are too proud to
get right down on all fours and whimper when they want something.
I will send the information you requested right away.  If you don't
see it within a day, call my 900 number and complain.  It is only
$1.50 per minute.

Sincerely,

Dogbert

Dear Mr. Adams,

I THINK YOUR CARTOONS ARE LOUSY,
PLEASE STOP SMOKING THAT DAMN CRACK!

Dear Ahmamouse,

Mr. Adams resents that comment.  He has been known to erase crack
to satisfy editors but he never smokes them.

Dear Mr. Adams,

My Latin teacher gives us extra credit if we bring in anything that
contains one or more of our 'daily phrases,' such as 'Ad Hoc,'
'Ante Meridian,' and 'Circa.'  I was wondering if you could make me
a cartoon including many Latin phrases that would still be used
today.  This would be a big help.


Abe



Dear Ape,

Latin is what's known as a dead language.  It got that way because
every time a Latin student asked for a special cartoon he was slain
by a hideous monster that lived under his bed.  I'm not saying that
will happen to you, right away.  Anyway, here's a little story that
uses your daily phrases.

My poor Irish ante Meridian was broke.  So she circa the block in
her hometown of Unum until she saw a fish fall from the back of a
fish delivery truck.  It was a carpe worth ten cents.  She thought
that that carpe diem would get her out of hock, or at least reduce
it, but she used so much gas driving in circa that it turned out to
be an ad hoc situation.  So she ate a potato and went to visit her
niece, Pati O'Furniture who lived in the town of Pluri.  She took
the E Pluri Bus from Unum.


Sincerely,


Dogbert

Buried Cities
-------------

Recently I saw a TV show in which archaeologists were uncovering a
buried city. What's up with that? I mean, even if you were the
dumbest of all ancient peoples, wouldn't you notice that your city
was slowly getting covered up with dirt and maybe crank up your
housekeeping efforts a notch? And don't tell me that brooms hadn't
been invented yet. They had plenty of sticks and plenty of
chickens, so you'd think that by pure coincidence one day a chicken
would back into a stick and invent the broom.

Maybe when the dirt builds up gradually you don't notice a problem
until your house disappears. I can imagine the conversation on the
day they figured out what was happening:

Ixphalup:  Hey, Fnorkzak, be a dear and go downstairs and get
           my stone bowl, the crude one.

Fnorkzak:  Downstairs is gone. It's all dirt.

Ixphalup:  Uh oh, fetch Grandpa; it's time to abandon the
           city.

Fnorkzak:  He's downstairs, most of him anyway, except for
           the top of his head.

Ixphalup:  Hmm... It sounds like I found a new bowl.


I like to mock the ancients, but I'm a bad housekeeper myself,
albeit not on the "lost city" scale. Sometimes I'll lose a pencil
-- at most a sneaker -- to the growing sediment layer before I'm
forced by the homeowners' association to sell the house. But I'm
too fastidious to lose anything big like a car or sofa.

Fun fact: Until Mayor Giuliani cleaned up New York City, the
highest building was two stories tall and no one could remember
when anything had been taller.

Disturbing Trend
-----------------

Stay with me on this line of reasoning: Vice President Dick Cheney
recently got a defibrillator to keep his heart beating. He also has
corrective lenses to enhance his vision. He has fillings in his
teeth so he can eat and he has a cell phone in his pocket.
Individually these items mean nothing but collectively they raise
an important question:

     How much hardware can you have attached to your
     body before you're technically a cyborg?

I'm worried that Cheney is already a cyborg. Without the hardware,
he'd be a blind, starving, bald guy with no pulse. That's a pretty
good argument for defining him as part man, part machine. The
disturbing thing is this: To whom does he pledge his allegiance --
machines or people?

If I'm right, within two years Cheney will be living inside a
hardened mountain in Wyoming, hardwired into the national missile
defense grid. And we'll all become slaves to our machine overlords.
Highways will be filled with humans carrying SUVs on their backs.
Television sets will make you dance for their amusement. It won't
be pretty.

Before you rush to label me paranoid, consider who elected Cheney
in the first place. Sure, we humans pulled the levers and poked the
chads, but in the end the machines did the counting and elected one
of their own.

And you'll notice that Cheney supports any policy that results in
more hardware, like the Star Wars missile defense shield and more
oil drilling. I think this is how machines reproduce. First they
conquer the humanoid government and then they create tax incentives
to produce more machines. The ants are milking the aphids and we're
the aphids.

I don't know what George W. Bush's role is in all this, but if you
look at his recent photos you'll see that he always has a little
oil can with him.

The irony is that Al Gore lost the election largely because he
looked like a robot. In fact, he was only an advanced android from
a distant nebula sent here as a prank.

Anyway, I'm worried that somehow Cheney will get control of the
Internet and ...

Boss and Cow-orker Quotes
-------------------------

Here now, more true-life quotes from bosses and cow-orkers,
submitted by DNRC members.

----

During one meeting with clients my boss told them to, "Cut the cake
a different way and go for the lowest hanging fruit."  I told him
he should tell them to go for the lowest hanging plums.....

----

We used to have a vice president who had a way with words.  He told
us during a meeting that we couldn't start a new program because,
"We'd be biting off a new can of worms."

When he was hiring a new secretary he said that he "had been
interviewing some good suspects."

My assistant told me, "Don't kiss a gift horse in the mouth."

---

Combining two quotes to stress the fact that he had a backup plan,
my boss said, "I've got a card in my hole."

---

I was driving to the Omaha, Nebraska, airport with my boss and our
conversation led to airport food.  He said the last time he ate the
food at the Omaha airport it gave him gonorrhea.  (We think he
meant diarrhea.)

---

"Well, it's no skin off MY teeth!"

A friend's mother frequently uses the phrase, "sweating like a
stuck pig."

----

All from one boss...

"That's just cutting your throat to spite your face."

"We have to be careful not to put all our apples in one cart."

"This project is like pulling hen's teeth."

"I'm being raped over the coals."

----

In a misguided attempt to motivate me, my pointy-haired boss once
said, "Remember!  There is no 'I' in 'Team Spirit'!"

I tried to explain that there are two of them in there but it
seemed to confuse him.

----

A true quote from my sister's pointy-haired boss:

"I don't want to throw another monkey at the wrench right now."

----

My boss was pleased that with one phone call we had "killed two
stones."

----

A good PHB misquote:

"...if we pass mustard..."

----

At one meeting my boss said, "That'll put the can amongst the
worms."

---

I have a friend whose supervisor proudly proclaimed that her new
car was a "Honda Accordion Hunchback."  By the way, she was the
supervisor of the Customer Service department.



Lazy Entrepreneur
-----------------
http://www.dilbert.com/comics/dilbert/lazyentrepreneur/

The Lazy Entrepreneur feature on Dilbert.com has over 4,000
brilliant ideas submitted by DNRC members. I just submitted a new
one that I call BIG DOG SHIELD. It's a Plexiglas(tm) shield you can
use when visiting the home of someone who has a huge exuberant
slobbering dog who insists on jumping and drooling all over your
good clothes. You'd only need the shield for the first five minutes
of the visit, until the dog calms down. Florist shops could rent
the BIG DOG SHIELD to young men on prom night when they pick up
their corsages. When the young man arrives at his date's house, and
her big slobbering dog lunges toward his rented tuxedo with forty
toenails and nine pounds of wet tongue, the young man can toss the
corsage in the foyer and hide behind the BIG DOG SHIELD until his
date is ready to go. It's not the most macho way to start a date,
but it's better than wearing slobber to the prom.


True Tales of Induhviduals
--------------------------

Induhviduals continue to amaze and amuse. Here are more True Tales,
submitted by DNRC members.

---

Actual conversation I overheard in school:

Induhvidual 1:  "If the Eiffel tower is a bridge, how come
                you can't drive on it?"

Induhvidual 2:  "The Eiffel tower isn't a bridge."

Induhvidual 1:  "Yes it is. You can walk across it, and it
                has two tall block things."

Induhvidual 2:  "The last time I was in New York it wasn't a
                bridge."


----

Here's a true Induhvidual story that I found in the Swedish
newspaper "Sydsvenska Dagbladet."

Four people were chosen randomly and asked if they were concerned
that they might buy products produced by children. Three of the
four people said they think child labor is horrible and that they
would never buy products made by children. The fourth person missed
the point entirely and said that she wouldn't buy these products
since children "have no feeling for quality, which will result in
poorer quality of the final product."

----

A few years ago, as a solar eclipse approached, some planetarium
directors in Southern California sent out warnings to the community
about the eclipse. Experience shows that daytime darkness leads to
accidents among Induhviduals, and also they have been known to
stare at the partially eclipsed sun and blind themselves.  (Honest.
It really happens.)  The planetarium received an indignant letter
from a local Induhvidual.  She said that if an eclipse was so
dangerous, they never should have decided to hold one and ought to
cancel it.

-----

My dad always locked his keys in the car by accident.  He had been
doing this for about a year, when one day, he approached my mom and
said, "You know what?  I'm going to leave the coat hanger in the
trunk so I can unlock the car the next time this happens."

-----

Our company accountant came and asked for a new power strip and I
gave him one. Then he asked if I could come and install it for him.
I told him it was pretty simple - shutdown computer, unplug
everything, remove existing strip, plug in new strip, plug in
computer, turn it on. He said, "Really?"

Recognizing the opportunity I said, "Well, you also have to Telnet
into the device, and make sure it's set for English voltage and not
metric or else you'll burn up the motherboard." He looked confused
and said, "I'll wait until you have time to install it."

---

I saw a lady on TV who liked to collect Nativity scenes. She
proudly showed off one of her favorite sets, where the figures,
according to her description, were "African-American."

-----

We had a CONsultant come in to our company who helped us determine
our personality types so that we could learn to work together
better.  She uses the Jung-Myers-Briggs Typology and one of the
continuums it ranks you on is Judging versus Perceiving (J vs P).
She paired up people who fell into the P category with people who
were in the J category for an exercise in which they were supposed
to try to think like the other.  The president of our company said
he didn't understand the purpose so she tried to explain it to him.

"You have a lot of J-ness, but not enough P-ness."

Needless to say the exercise was never completed.

---

Recently the teachers' contract in my school district ran out and
the teachers demanded a 4% raise.  Two weeks before the strike date
the school board passed out an exam to all students; the average
grade was 49%. The school board told the teachers that this was
unacceptable and there would be no raises. But they offered that
the teachers could get 1% pay increases for every 3% the average
test score increased on the next test. The union came back with one
demand, that the teachers create the tests. The next test average
was 76%, which the school board credited to "our ability to
motivate our teachers." And how.

-----

A couple of years ago at college, I went to the library to get a
signed statement that I did not have any unpaid library fines. This
was required to get my exam results. The woman at the counter wrote
down my name and student ID followed by, "does not have any fines
at the libara." She crossed off the last word and tried again with
"liberery", then crossed that out and wrote "here."

I wonder what she uses as her job title?

----

One day in the cafeteria at my school a girl was asking for
donations for a foundation named after a boy who had a terminal
illness.  Unfortunately the boy had recently died, so she was
asking us to "donate money for this dead kid."  My Induhvidual
buddy actually asked her how money could help a dead kid.  When she
said -- get this-- "It might help with the autopsy," he responded,
"Oh, so they might still be able to cure him?"

----

My friend's seven-month pregnant wife was returning to her car with
her three-year-old daughter after shopping in the mall.  The
daughter wanted to play driver so Linda (not her real name) allowed
her daughter to sit in the driver's seat.  The daughter insisted
that Linda sit in the backseat of her four-door Honda.  After a
couple of minutes of playtime Linda decided it was time to go home.
She tried to get out of the car but the childproof locks wouldn't
let her open the back doors of the car. So Linda crawled between
the two front seats, then crawled headfirst out to the parking.
Upon returning home she told her tale of woe to her husband who --
being the sensitive guy he is -- said, "Why didn't you roll down
the window and open the door from the outside?"

----

When I worked at Barnes & Noble years ago I had a customer ask
where we kept the "large-print audio books."

----

My teenage daughter sometimes forgets her house key and is locked
out after school. Her first choice of entry is to ask our neighbor
to get out his ladder and climb in a window on the second floor and
unlock a door. She's done this several times. We get to tease her a
lot about being an airhead.

So one day I locked myself out on the way to do errands. I was in
the car before I even realized I had left my keys inside. So,
thinking of my daughter's solution, I asked my laughing neighbor
for help. Being a nice guy, he obliged with his ladder, climbing to
the second story, etc.

Later that day, I was relating the story to my husband. When I got
to the part about sitting in the car without the keys he said, "And
then you took the garage door opener out of the glove compartment
and let yourself in?"

-----

My local supermarket recently had a campaign to raise money for the
Jimmy Fund, a New England charity for children with cancer. At the
checkout, clerks asked customers if they wished to donate a dollar
to the Jimmy Fund.

As I left the store, I noticed the hand-lettered sign by the door:
"Fight Children With Cancer."

Geez, I thought, don't those poor kids have it hard enough already?

----

My first year of graduate school, I moved into an apartment that
didn't have a smoke detector. After doing some checking into state
landlord-tenant law, I confirmed my suspicion that the landlady was
required to provide us with a smoke detector, so I took the issue
up with the landlady.  My Induhvidual of a roommate was upset with
me for this, fearing that by "rocking the boat" I was going to get
us kicked out of the apartment. She summed up her arguments to me
by saying, "Besides which, I don't see why we even need a smoke
detector.  Back home in Kentucky, we never had a smoke detector at
our house and we never once had a fire."

----

My company experienced a power outage (California).  When all was
dark, several employees grabbed the flashlights that are stored in
boxes in the hallway for just such an occasion.  One employee's
flashlight was very dim, suggesting that the battery was not fully
charged.  I noticed that he was repeatedly holding his hand over
the front of the flashlight, then pulling it away.  When I asked
him what he was doing he explained that he was "trying to build up
a lot of light."

-----

At Badwater, Death Valley, there's a sign on a rock to indicate sea
level. I overheard a couple of Induhviduals who were looking at
the sign and talking.

The woman says, "I wonder if it's the top or bottom."

"Of the sign?" her husband asks.

"No, of the sea," she replied.

-----

Being the "scientific" one around the office, an Induhvidual asked
me if I knew about telescopes.  I said yes and she explained that
she bought her son a telescope but she couldn't seem to get it to
focus on any stars.  I told her to point it at houses down the
street with lights and see if she could see anything.  She said,
"You can use a telescope to look at things on the ground?"  As it
turns out, focusing wasn't the problem.  It had been an overcast
evening and she thought the telescope was strong enough to get
through the clouds to see stars.


---

I saw this sign on a Chinese restaurant:

KING CRAP
2 for $35

I think they meant King Crab but I can't be sure.

----

A Burger King restaurant in Rome, NY, was advertising for
"Closers"... but the "C" was removed or blown away from their
marquee so it read "Losers Wanted."

----

I heard this from an Induhvidual standing near the Continental
Divide at Yellowstone Park:

"On which side of the Continental Divide does the water flow
uphill?"

----

There is a locked suggestion box in the cafeteria of my company. I
just found out from HR that no one has a key for it.

---

My wife manages a convenience store.  Yesterday a mother and
daughter (maybe two years old) came into the store.  When the
mother was ready to go to the register, she called to her daughter,
"Ampersand! Ampersand!  Let's go honey."

My wife couldn't believe what she heard, so she asked the customer,
"What's your daughter's name?" and the Induhvidual replied,
"Ampersand.  I don't know what it means, but I think it's a lovely
girl's name."

-----

With the recent and spectacular downturn of the stock market there
has been a lot of concern in the mutual fund industry as "assets
under management" shrink.  While we haven't experienced layoffs,
the environment has been eroded to the point where many people have
left the company of their own accord.  In an effort to bolster
morale, the marketing people and HR teamed up and delivered bunches
of those sporting-event foam hands with the index finger sticking
up to proclaim our company as "Number one!"  But it seems that the
legal department got involved too, so in large letters this big
finger declares: "For internal use only!"

Dear Mr. Adams,

When my local newspaper moved Dilbert to the business section it
became three frames instead of four. Was that your decision or the
paper's?

      Ana


Dear Anal,

Mr. Adams creates over 100 frames for every daily strip, thanks to
the help of highly trained capuchin monkeys. The newspapers receive
the whole pile and throw away whatever frames they don't like. Some
keep one or two frames, and a few who have no taste keep as many as
three or four. Mr. Adams used to feel bad about his ratio until he
learned that the creator of The Family Circus actually draws a full
length animated motion picture every day -- using absolutely no
monkeys -- and the newspapers only use one frame. That's gotta be
frustrating.


     Sincerely,


     Dogbert

To:     Dogbert's New Ruling Class (DNRC)

- TV Show Update

Elian Invasion
--------------

Many of you in the U.S. have been following the fate of the little
Cuban boy Elian, who came to the United States via a
dolphin-powered inner tube.  Some people believe Elian is some sort
of Holy Child because the dolphins helped him, and because he's
small, leading people to assume he is a child.  I was a believer in
the Holy Child theory until the INS swarmed Elian's relatives' home
and took him against his will.  "Where were the dolphins then?" I ask.

Maybe they were lazy dolphins.  Whatever their excuse, I'm
disappointed that we didn't get to see the INS and the dolphins
fight it out, hand-to-flipper.  That would have been good TV.
Dolphins have a great defensive move where they suddenly turn
around so your fist gets stuck in the blowhole.  Then they beat you
senseless with their powerful tails.  I think we'd all like to see that.

On the plus side, by my reckoning, Elian's dilemma has saved the
lives of at least two celebrities, maybe more.  As you know, during
slow news periods the major networks kill celebrities and make it
look accidental.  Personally, I won't board an airplane unless the
newspaper is packed with good stories.

I prefer the media's latest news-creating technique, wherein they
blame NASA for launching rockets into space and losing them.  In
reality, NASA hasn't done much of anything since 1969, when they
sent three guys in helium-filled space suits to New Mexico with a
black and white camcorder.  I still remember where I was when I saw
it on TV.  I was on Earth.


Dilbert TV Fate
----------------

I'm not exaggerating when I say that literally dozens of people
noticed when Dilbert disappeared from UPN's lineup on American TV.
Officially, UPN told me the show was put on "hiatus."  Or maybe
they said they "hate us."  It sounds the same on the telephone when
you're sobbing.

Apparently someone noticed there were four new episodes that had
never aired.  So, starting on Tuesday, May 30th at 8:30 p.m.
Eastern  (7:30 Central), the first of the new Dilbert shows airs.

In a master stroke of UPN programming brilliance, Dilbert follows
Shasta McNasty, a show geared toward viewers who are...how can I
say this...very likely to die in bowling ball cleaning machine
accidents.  Fortunately, Shasta is a filthy and sophomoric show, so
it will corner the market on perverts and unsupervised minors.
It's a perfect lead-in audience for an animated Dilbert TV show.
If you don't understand that, you will never be a television executive.

The other networks are running nothing but commercials during that
time period.  You don't need to check.  Trust me on this.


March 21st Explained
--------------------

Many readers were confused by the March 21st strip featuring
Dilbert's future self visiting his past self from across time.
Dilbert asks the future Dilbert how his head got wrinkled.  Future
Dilbert points to a device on his chest with a hole in the center
and says, "Stick a finger in this hole."  That's the whole joke.

This is an example of a cartoon that appeals to no one but me, or
so I discovered from my e-mail.  I like the idea that a future
Dilbert would invent a device that has no other purpose than to
make your head deformed.  It's one of those inventions that seem
like a good idea until you try it.  But the funny part (okay, just
to me) is that he would advise his past self to stick a finger in
it, thus making the same mistake twice.

In retrospect, it was just a bad cartoon.  There wasn't enough
information.  But it made me laugh.  If you think the cartons are
made for your benefit, maybe you shouldn't be so selfish.



Why Do Some People Get Paid?
----------------------------

A reader sent me this story:

"Our coffee room has a bulletin board. One day a woman with a ruler
and a clipboard came in and measured the distance between the
postings on the board with the ruler. She took great care to
measure the height and width between each piece of paper, and
between the pieces of paper and the edges of the board. Then,
without a word, she checked off something on the clipboard and went away.

"I was in a daze for the next fifteen minutes.  I couldn't
concentrate during the following meeting. I wondered, does this
woman actually get paid for this? Does she find fulfillment in her
work? Who came up with the idea for this job? Are THEY just playing
with our minds, whoever THEY are?

"Needless to say I went back to the coffee room after the meeting
and moved all the postings around."

[Editor's note: To me, the funny part is that the author of this
story got paid for sitting in a daze during a meeting and later
rearranging the scraps of paper on a bulletin board.]



The DNRC at Work For You
-------------------------

A DNRC member reports on another benefit of membership.

"It turns out that my English tutor at Cornell is in the DNRC.  I
told her that I was in the organization too. That was a month ago
and since then I have been getting constant 'check plusses' for my
essays, regardless of my effort.

"Thanks a million!!"

If you're not already showing preferential treatment to DNRC
members, it's time to start.  Remember, only the DNRC has the good
sense to haze people who have no prospect of becoming members.



Getting Free Stuff the DNRC Way
-------------------------------

If you're annoying enough, you can get free services almost
anywhere, as this DNRC member reports.

"My roommate and I put coins in a jar every time we used the phone.
When it was time to pay the bill, we went to the bank to get the
coins counted. The teller said there was a fee for counting money
because we didn't have an account at that bank.  The conversation
went like this:

'How much would it cost if we had an account?'

'Then it would be free.'

'How much does it cost to open an account?'

'Nothing, it's free.'

'How much does it cost to close an account?'

'Um...That's also free.'

'Then we'd like to open an account, count this money, then close
the account. That's all free, isn't it?'

"She spent a few seconds thinking about this, and then she let us
use the money-counting machine, for free."



Spooky Happenings In My Office
------------------------------

Recently I noticed that beverages were disappearing from my office.
I installed a hidden surveillance camera to identify the culprit.

Dilbert.com
-----------

We've revamped the "List Of The Day" area on Dilbert.com.  It's the
most popular part of the site after the comics.  Some of you DNRC
members are impressively funny.  Others just have laughably pitiful
jobs that translate into amusing list items.  Either way, it's
equally funny to me.

We've added a True Tales of Induhviduals page, at
http://www.dilbert.com/comics/dilbert/dnrc/induhvidual.html.
Submit your stories and read those submitted by others.  Feed your
sense of intellectual superiority by reading how dumb other people
are.  It's a guilty pleasure, but pleasure nonetheless.

Another addition to the DNRC section is the cubicle art page, which
features art created by people who were pretending to work. Each
week the best submissions are posted at
http://www.dilbert.com/comics/dilbert/dnrc/cubical.html.


DNRC members-only link icons are now available at
http://www.unitedmedia.com/comics/dilbert/dnrc/membersonly.html.
This link is available only in the newsletter.

True Tales of Induhviduals
---------------------------

And now, for your reading pleasure, more True Tales Of Induhviduals
-- those clueless-but-entertaining blobs of organic matter that
clog our highways and keep our taxes high.


True Tale
------------

My company has instituted Company Values.  Arranged appropriately,
the values are Fun, Agility, Teamwork, Learning, Integrity and
Empowerment.

The acronym speaks for itself: FAT LIE


True Tale
------------

My school subscribes to a system that is supposed to help us find
jobs when we graduate. It works by asking us what subjects we are
studying, what sort of job we want, etc.

When I input my classes and interests it came up with only two
career suggestions.

Careers in IT
Careers in LAW

Neither choice appealed to me.  I tweaked my entries to see if
other options would appear.  It wasn't until I deleted 'English
Skills' from my list of subjects studied that it added a third
career option.

Careers in MANAGEMENT



True Tale
------------

I was standing in line at the grocery store when a loud voice came
over the intercom saying, 'Okay, shoppers, it's time for our hourly
drawing for a bag of free groceries.' In the front of the store
someone was spinning a big wheel with the numbers 1 to 8 on it. The
voice continued, "If your lane number comes up, and you are at the
front of the line, you win." I noticed that a checker was opening
the register next to me. Just at that moment, the number of that
newly opened lane came up on the wheel. The other customers were
too busy cursing their bad luck to realize that the winning
register was empty.  I casually moved over to that line. With great
fanfare, I was awarded the prize -- a bag of free groceries. It was
filled with bizarre items I would never eat, including cinnamon
rice cakes, canned collard greens, Wonder Bread and the like.  So I
gave the free bag of groceries to a woman who seemed terribly upset
at not winning it herself. She exploded with joy like she had just
won the lottery.

Induhviduals are so easy to please.


True Tale
------------

At Denver International Airport, there are emergency exits, the
type with alarms if they are opened.  Printed on the doors are
signs that say,
"In an emergency, push and hold door for fifteen seconds until
doors open."

[Editor's note: There is a name for people who stand in the
emergency doorway for fifteen seconds during a real emergency:
"flattened."]



True Tale
------------

I went to lunch with a new employee who was not familiar with the
city.  On the way back, he decided to stop at a bookstore.  Hours
later, my boss and I realized that he had not returned.  Fearing
the worst, we called down to our crack security guards and asked,
"If you needed to take someone to the hospital, where would you
take him?"

The guard asked me to hold.  A few minutes later he came back with
the official answer: "the hospital."


True Tale
------------

When I received a check from my previous company for my 401K
rollover, I noticed the date on the check was 1-18-1999, even
though the check was written in January, 2000.  IRS regulations
don't allow 401K rollovers that are more than 90 days old.  I went
to my former place of employment and pointed out the error to the
HR Duhrector, who had originally written the check.  His solution
was to cross out 1999 and write 2000 above it.  Then he initialed
and dated the change... 1/25/99.


True Tale
------------

Here are some true phrases used by my boss:

"Ah, that's the flaw in the ointment."

"There's the gem in the haystack."

"We need to increase sales!  Let's throw some more wrenches in the
fire!"

"I believe that like I believe a hole in the head!"


True Tale
------------

My office is near Orlando, FL.  An Induhvidual in my office noticed
several people leaving the building.  She asked me, "Where is
everyone going?"  I told her we were going to watch the shuttle
launch.  She asked, "Is it outside?"


True Tale
------------

I was buying a newspaper at the convenience store.  The clerk looks
down at the paper and says, "Is that fifty cents or a dollar? I can
never remember."

I pointed to the clearly-visible price of 50 cents printed on the
corner of the paper and said, "Fifty cents. Who'd pay a dollar for
this paper?!?"

"Oh, some people do," said the clerk.

"Really? Why?"

"Because that's what I charge them."



True Tale
------------

My boss called me into his office.  While attaching a keyboard to
his computer, he asked if I would mind going to my desk and running
a particular program.  He needed the data right away and my
computer was the only one set up for this particular function.

I said that it was no problem and headed to my desk, only to find
that it was MY keyboard he had taken.


True Tale
------------

A bank recently sent a letter to its bankcard holders with some
details about its new cards. The first line of the letter is a real
whopper:

"The year 2000 has come quicker than expected!"

[Editor's note: Customers of that bank might want to double-check
their interest calculations.]


True Tale
------------

This conversation actually happened.  The names have been changed
to protect the stupid.

Jack: "G.W. Bush is fairly attractive, especially for a man his
age."

Jill: "Yeah, I guess he's gotten better looking since he was
president."

Jack: "Eh??"

Jill: "I mean, he looks much younger than he did when he was
president in '92."

Jack: "That's because it's HIS SON!"

[Editor's note:  After Dogbert takes over, Jill will be used as a
knickknack on a very large shelf.]


True Tale
------------

Early in my career as an electrical engineer, I worked for the
Navy.  One day a directive was sent to all employees informing us,
"Should you get killed or injured on the job, you are required to
notify your supervisor immediately."



True Tale
------------

True memo from a school principal:

     Do you know if there is any way to adjust the volume on the
     fire alarm? It is shrill and extremely loud.  If we could turn

     the volume down some it would help.

     Please advise,

     Thanks,

     <PHB-Principal>


True Tale
------------

In the dining hall at my school, a sign reads, "At Cornell Dining,

we want all your dining experiences to be successful."

[Editor's note:  Maybe I'm twisted, but I have many images in my
head of what qualifies as "unsuccessful dining" and all of them
seem funny to me.]


True Tale
------------

At our company we frequently need to discard empty boxes that won't
fit in trashcans.  The Induhvidual who picks up the trash ignores
anything outside the trashcan unless you tape a big sign on it that
says "TRASH."  This is very annoying but we've all gotten used to it.

In a seemingly unrelated event, folks started thinking that we
should have a "disaster plan" just in case a tornado wipes out the
building. We were told to gather up copies of everything needed to
put us back into business after a catastrophe.  Hundreds of boxes
full of documents were gathered together, categorized, inventoried,
labeled and put near the dock for transportation to the underground
caves, where they would be safe. The Induhvidual who ignores our
empty trash boxes promptly threw them all out.

True Tale
---------

Our marketing director was nicknamed Axel. He decided to have a
departmental meeting to explain his new role after the
reorganization.

He compared the company to a car, and the various departments as
the wheels.  To finish off, he asked a question. "So, what do you
think keeps the wheels attached to the car?" He expected someone to
shout "The axle," relating to his own role and nickname. To his
annoyance, someone yelled out "The nuts."


True Tale
---------

As I was being terminated, the VP asked that I not be too critical
of him in case he hadn't made the right choice in firing me. This
was an unpleasant experience for him. He also asked for my
understanding because he might have to fire more people later in
the week.  In the company's management training, they stress the
need for empathy when letting an employee go. No doubt he missed
the part where they said empathy TOWARDS OTHERS.


True Tale
---------

I was having dinner recently at a nice restaurant and I asked the
waiter if the soup had meat in it.  His reply:  "Not really."


True Tale
---------

I'm a Democrat but I voted in the Republican primary because I can
in South Carolina.  While in line at the voting location I talked
to two married Induhviduals. One was voting for Bush and the other
for McCain.  When I asked them if they weren't concerned that their
votes would cancel each other out, the husband said, "Well, we
wouldn't normally even vote, but we wanted to come out and cancel
out all those Democrats who were going to vote Republican today."



Revenge Is A Dish Best Served to Someone Else
---------------------------------------------

Approximately every ten minutes some @$$hole gives out my public
e-mail address instead of his or her own to an online store.
People do this so they don't get deluged with junk mail.  But
online stores are getting smarter.  They send confirmations to my
address before initiating the service or mailing the product.  The
confirmation letters often include information identifying the
culprit.  Recently a Patricia White from Virginia ordered some
magazines online and used my e-mail address so I would get her junk
mail.  I was more than happy to "correct" her name as it would
appear on the shipping labels of her monthly magazines.

Here was my response to the online store's confirmation request.


Dear Sirs,

re: Order Number: 16496863

Please change my last name to my married name, as I will be using
that more commonly.

     Old name: Pat White

     Change to New name: Pat McGroin

Thank you for your attention.


    P. McGroin





Dogbert Answers My Mail
-----------------------

In this section, Dogbert answers my mail.  These are real e-mail
messages sent to me.  The names have been changed to make them
easier to mock.

The first letter is from someone who objected to my strip in which
Dogbert gave Ratbert a bumper sticker reading WWDD (What Would
Dogbert Do).  It was inspired by the popular WWJD (What Would Jesus
Do) bumper stickers.  I thought I was mocking bumper sticker
wisdom, not Christianity, but many readers felt differently.

Dear Mr. Adams,

I have long been a fan of Dilbert, but your strip of today was
worse than witless.  Your cartoon that mocks the WWJD slogan serves
no purpose other than to profane.  You obviously had a case of IQ
catatonia when you drew it.  Evidently, it spread to your editor as
well when you submitted it.  Keep it up and you'll be relegated to
the ash heap of once-trendy nitwits who didn't know the difference
between humor and inflammatory idiocy.

    Byron C.
    Alabama



Dear Boron,

I'm glad you are committed to your philosophy of doing what Jesus
would do.  I assume that includes writing insulting letters to
cartoonists on company time.  Apparently the bibles in Alabama have
a few extra chapters.  If I were you, I wouldn't take too many
suggestions from the Book of Willy.

     Sincerely,

     Dogbert


----



(This message suspiciously had no greeting)

You are an incredible talent, and I am always impressed by your
work.

Cutting to the chase, I have established a web site to help fund my
college tuition. It is www.justinduke.com.  If you like anything
you see there, please send me a dime.

If you like, tell your friends, thanks.

      Justin



Dear Dustbin,

If your web site sucks and your message to me is a poorly disguised
mass mailing, please send me a dime.

      Sincerely,


      Dogbert

Dear Mr. Adams,

We are currently trying to raise money to buy new uniforms and
instruments for the Knoxville schools' music programs.  We are
organizing a celebrity auction, and would be greatly honored if you
could donate an autographed item or some other piece of memorabilia
to help make our auction a success.

Sincerely,
Terry F.
Vice-President Knoxville Music Boosters



Dear Hairy F.,

I can think of no charitable cause more worthwhile than increasing
the supply of bad music in Knoxville. Unfortunately, Mr. Adams has
already given away most of his possessions to other celebrity
auctions.  It's slim pickings now.  But you could have his comb
(rarely needed), his old toothbrush (in six months), and the holes
in his socks.

       Sincerely,


       Dogbert

Dear Reader,

Hello! I'm Avinash from Bombay, India. I'm 18 years old and am
presently in college. I require a currency note of any denomination
from the United States of America or any Latin American country for
a geography project that I'm presently working on. I would be
extremely grateful if you could mail a note to my address which
I've written below. If you cannot, then thanks anyway for taking
the time to read my e-mail.

       Avinash
       Bombay, India.



Dear Avinashwipe,

This is an amazing coincidence.  I too am doing a project that
involves collecting currency from other countries.  After you
finish your project, maybe you could send the piles of money to me
for my project.  My project is a bit more ambitious than yours; I'm
collecting all of the currency from every country.

       Sincerely,


       Dogbert


Dear Mr. Adams,

I am in the midst of an argument and I need a fresh perspective and
I figured that you had an opinion on everything, so.... which came
first, the freaking chicken or the egg?

      Gregory


Dear Eggory,

Put your finger in this hole.

     Sincerely,


     Dogbert



Dilberito Update
----------------

Tip:  It's illegal and immoral to slay your enemies, but if you eat
nutritious food and outlive them, you can still dance on their
graves.  There's nothing illegal or immoral about dancing.

The Dilberito, a tasty burrito packed with 100% of your daily
values of 23 vitamins and minerals, is on grocery shelves and
selling briskly.  Check http://www.dilberito.com for names of
stores.

Coming soon, all four flavors of the Dilberito will be vegan (two
are now).  And watch for a free downloadable Dilberito game this
summer.  Details will be on the website.





Dilbert Fodder
---------------

What's bugging you about your job?  Let me know and you might see
it in a Dilbert comic, TV show or newsletter.  The best comic
fodder involves workplace peeves, devious strategies, frustrations
of dealing with others, conflicting objectives, unintended
management consequences, and of course my favorite - idiot bosses.

And I love True Tales of Induhviduals.

And if you're seeing any new management trends that need to be
mocked, I can help.  Send your suggestions to me at
scottadams@aol.com.  Short ones are better.

Wisconsin Gas to Purchase Nine Mile Line From Northern Natural Gas

07/13/2001
PR Newswire
(Copyright (c) 2001, PR Newswire)

Line Will Enhance Competition in Southeast Wisconsin and Use Existing 
Facilities 

MILWAUKEE, July 13 /PRNewswire/ -- Wisconsin Gas, Northern Natural Gas and 
Guardian Pipeline announced today that Wisconsin Gas has signed an agreement 
with Northern Natural Gas (NNG) to purchase a nine mile, high pressure 
natural gas pipeline in Walworth and Waukesha counties. The purchase price is 
$5 million. The proposed transaction will require approval from federal and 
state regulators. The pipe, known as the Eagle line, is located southeast of 
the Kettle Moraine Forest near Eagle, Wis.
The existing line has been part of the NNG interstate transmission system. 
Under the new ownership, the line will become part of the Wisconsin Gas 
distribution system and will interconnect with Guardian Pipeline as well as 
the NNG system. 
"Northern Natural Gas is pleased to be a part of a creative, cost-effective 
solution to provide additional gas service to southeastern Wisconsin," said 
Dave Neubauer, vice president of business development and marketing, Northern 
Natural Gas. "This transaction enables Wisconsin Gas and its customers to 
obtain natural gas supplies from Guardian or NNG. Providing reliable, 
economical choices for consumers will benefit all of the parties involved." 
"We saw this as an opportunity to minimize environmental impact and still 
realize the benefits of increased competition in the natural gas market," 
said James Schott, senior vice president, Wisconsin Gas. "The purchase of the 
Eagle line will enable Wisconsin Gas to further our goal of providing 
cost-efficient natural gas service to our customers." 
As a result of the purchase Guardian Pipeline, the 141-mile interstate 
pipeline from Joliet, Ill. to Ixonia, Wis., will no longer build an 8.5-mile 
lateral to Eagle. The lateral was part of the originally certified Guardian 
Pipeline. This portion of the line would have generally run parallel to the 
current Northern Natural pipeline. 
"This sale is a win-win situation for Guardian and consumers," said George 
Hass, project manager of Guardian Pipeline. "The Eagle line purchase by 
Wisconsin Gas saves Guardian time and resources by taking away the need to 
build the 8.5-mile lateral and allows all three companies to create a better 
environment for competition in the natural gas marketplace." 
The existing gate stations at LaGrange and Eagle will remain in-service for 
regulation purposes. Odorization and measurement will take place at a new 
gate station that will be constructed at the interconnect with Guardian. This 
new gate station will be called the Bluff Creek station and will be located 
near Whitewater. The Bluff Creek gate station will be constructed during the 
construction of Guardian Pipeline. 
Northern Natural Gas, a subsidiary of Enron Corp., with a market area 
capacity of about 4.3 Bcf/d, provides natural gas transportation services to 
utility customers in the upper Midwestern United States through its 
approximately 16,000 miles of pipeline. 
Guardian Pipeline is a partnership of three Midwestern energy companies: CMS 
Energy, based in Dearborn, Mich.; Wisconsin Energy, headquartered in 
Milwaukee, Wis.; and Viking Gas Transmission Co., a wholly owned subsidiary 
of Xcel Energy Inc., and located in St. Paul, Minn. 
Wisconsin Electric-Wisconsin Gas, the principal utility subsidiary of 
Wisconsin Energy Corp. (NYSE: WEC), serves more than one million electric 
customers and more than 960,000 natural gas customers throughout Wisconsin 
and Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Visit our company's Web site at

Commodities Review: LME Copper Hit By Another Stock Rise
By Mark Long and Steve McGrath
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

07/13/2001
Dow Jones Commodities Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- Copper futures traded in London fell Friday, as a 
further influx of stocks into official warehouses put the copper market under 
pressure and dragged down the rest of the base metal complex. 
Three-month copper traded on the London Metal Exchange ended $6 down from 
Thursday's late kerb close at $1,554.50 a metric ton.
An increase of 7,475 tons of copper into LME warehouses Friday brought total 
stocks up to a 12-month high of 550,300 tons. This pressured prices in early 
trade down to test $1,550/ton support, although prices recovered slightly in 
later trade. 
Unconfirmed market talk said Enron is behind much of the week's stock rise, 
in an effort to ease nearby supply tightness and to alleviate the large short 
positions it is thought to have built up on the July-for-a-week spread, which 
is currently showing a $6-$8/ton backwardation. The July futures contract 
will switch over to cash Monday. 
Enron declined to comment on the market talk Friday. 
A backwardation is a pricing structure in which deliveries to be made in the 
near future are more expensive then those set for a more distant delivery. 
The opposite situation is called contango. 
"The spreads are still tight. The major longs are still reluctant to lend, 
with no signs of that (tightness) dissipated," said Kevin Norrish, an analyst 
with Barclays Capital in London. 
Dealers and analysts said they expect further stock increases next week. 
The entire base metals complex ignored Thursday's 237-point rally in the Dow 
Jones Industrial Average, dealers said. 
"Copper has been sensitive to moves in the stock market, but not this time," 
Norrish said. In fact, now it appears that base metals markets ignore 
equities markets when they rally, but follow stocks down when they slump, he 
added. 
European Grain Futures See Profit-Taking, But More Gains Expected 
European grain and oilseed futures were hit by a bout of profit-taking and 
pre-weekend position-squaring Friday, after rising to long-time highs, 
brokers said. 
However, world and domestic crop concerns, the strength of the dollar and 
general bullish sentiment will carry the markets to fresh highs short term, 
they said. 
On the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange, the 
benchmark November feed wheat contract ended just 25 pence up at GBP82/ton, 
after hitting a new two-year high of GBP83/ton in early trade. 
Meanwhile, Matif November rapeseed futures fell EUR2.75 on the day to 
EUR265/ton, after hitting a three-year high of EUR271/ton in early trade. 
The U.K. wheat crop and the French rapeseed crop are forecast to be well down 
on last year, and wheat and canola crops in some other major producing 
countries are also expected to fall. 
Meanwhile, the strength of the dollar is allowing European grain and oilseed 
traders to up prices and still remain competitive against U.S. imports and 
dollar-denominated grains on the world market.

LME Base Metals: Copper Pressured Down By Stock Build

Dow Jones Commodities Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- London Metal Exchange three-month copper ended Friday's 
late kerb lower compared with Thursday, pressured by another stock build, 
dealers said. 
(LME three-month metals prices in dollars a metric ton at 1600 GMT, with the 
previous late kerb close in parentheses. Comex copper at 1641 GMT in cents a 
pound, with the previous close in parentheses.) Copper 1,554.50 (1,560.50) 
Tin 4,452.50 (4,502.50) 
Aluminum 1,452.25 (1,458.50) Zinc 871.50 (877.50) 
Nickel 5,925.00 (6,012.50) Lead 462.50 (465.00) 
Comex Sep Copper 70.75 (70.80)
An increase of 7,475 tons of copper Friday brought total stocks up to a 
12-month high of 550,300 tons. This pressured prices in early trade down to 
test $1,550/ton support before rising slightly to close at $1,554.50/ton, 
down from Thursday's close of $1,560.50/ton. 
Unconfirmed market talk said Enron is behind much of the week's stock rise, 
in an effort to ease nearby supply tightness and to alleviate the large short 
positions it is thought to have built up on the July-for-a-week spread, which 
is currently showing a $6-$8/ton backwardation. The July futures contract 
will switch over to cash Monday. 
Enron declined to comment on the market talk. 
A backwardation is a pricing structure in which deliveries to be made in the 
near future are more expensive then those set for a more distant delivery. 
The opposite situation is called contango. 
"The spreads are still tight. The major longs are still reluctant to lend, 
with no signs of that (tightness) dissipated," said Kevin Norrish, an analyst 
with Barclays Capital in London. 
Dealers and analysts said they expect further stock increases next week. 
The entire base metals complex ignored Thursday's 237-point rally in the Dow 
Jones Industrial Average, dealers said. 
"Copper has been sensitive to moves in the stock market, but not this time," 
Norrish said. In fact, now it appears that base metals markets ignore 
equities markets when they rally, but follow stocks down when they slump, he 
added. 
Aluminum also ended the late kerb lower Friday. 
News of the restart of some smelters has dampened sentiment, despite a stock 
drawdown of around 8,000 tons since the end of last week, dealers said. 
"The stock drawdowns are fairly small percentage-wise," said Standard Bank 
analyst Robin Bhar, adding that they would need to be much larger to 
significantly improve market sentiment. 
"A test of $1,435/ton cannot be ruled out, though we would expect forward 
buying to prevent a break below this level for the time being," Barclays said 
in a market report. 
Zinc continued its slump, falling to a seven-and-a-half-year low, mainly on 
technicals. 
Technicals also hurt nickel, which rose slightly after breaking $5,900/ton 
support but still closed at its lowest level since April. 
Nickel's fall was "just on some speculative liquidation and short selling, 
mostly chart-based," Bhar said.

UK: Telecoms, drugs drive FTSE 100 rally, Vodafone leads.
By Camila Reed

07/13/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, July 13 (Reuters) - Britain's largest companies raced higher at the 
close on Friday fired by telecoms and drug stocks as they bounced back from 
Wednesday's 16-week low. 
Index heavyweights Vodafone and GlaxoSmithKline provided 27 of the day's 
55-point gain, while technology firms wobbled. However, the telecoms giant 
surged 4.1 percent to 157-1/4p.
The FTSE 100 finished 55.4 points or one percent firmer at 5,537.0, having 
jumped 1.66 percent on Thursday after seven consecutive losing sessions, with 
gainers outnumbering losers by three to one. 
Stocks steamed higher and refused to be derailed by sluggish U.S. retail 
sales figures for June, which showed only a meagre rise, and a weaker Wall 
Street, but volumes were thin at 1.4 billion shares. 
By London's 1530 GMT finish the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average was 
down five points, while the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index was flat, 
having streaked up in the previous session. 
Mike Lenhoff and Simon Rubinsohn at money managers Gerrard said that the UK 
equity market was deeply oversold and long-term this presented a buying 
opportunity for UK equities. 
DRUGS SEE-SAW 
Drugs reversed an earlier decline with Nycomed Amersham among the day's top 
performers, up nearly four percent at 536-1/2p and AstraZeneca rising over 
one percent. 
Mining giant Anglo American moved into the FTSE 100 top ten gainers with a 
three percent rise, as investors sought refuge in mining stocks as a cyclical 
play. 
Another major gainer was British business services firm Hays Plc up 3.4 
percent. The shares leapt on market talk that Germany's Deutsche Post was 
looking to make a bid for it, dealers said. 
Both Deutsche Post and Hays declined to comment. 
Firmer crude prices gave support to the oil sector. BP rose 0.6 percent to 
572 pence and Shell also added 0.6 percent to 581-1/2p lifting the index by 
four points. 
FTSE MIXED PICTURE 
But dealers and analysts said it would be a mixed picture going forward with 
the market scrutinising data for signs of a sustained economic recovery or a 
lapse in consumer confidence. 
"This week we had a really bloody day on Wednesday and then the opposite on 
Thursday, so we're going to be on a rollercoaster still. It's very fragile 
but it does show the potential of the market," said Foreign & Colonial 
director of UK equities David Manning. 
"It's not only the holiday period, it's also that the market can make you 
look an idiot one day to the next. In that sort of circumstance the 
temptation is to do very little," he said. 
ABN Amro strategist Gareth Williams said the market would make modest 
progress over the next month or so, with moves downward quite likely although 
the trend would be upwards over the course of the year. 
TECHS DIP 
Thursday's 5.3-percent rally in the Nasdaq failed to bring any cheer to UK 
technology shares. Logica and Colt Telecom slid four percent, while microchip 
designer ARM fell 3.9 percent to 223 pence trimming Thursday's 13 percent 
jump. 
The techMARK index of technology shares rose 0.98 percent to 1,602.87. 
Elsewhere on the downside, UK holiday operator Airtours lost nearly 10 
percent of its value after Swiss peer Kuoni issued a profit warning. 
Among second liners, Baltimore Technologies closed up 3.3 percent. It 
initially rallied 22 percent after the Irish Internet security firm said it 
received an approach from an unlisted British-based company for an all-paper 
deal to combine the companies. 
The FTSE 250 Mid-cap index finished 5.1 points stronger at 6,163.8. 
Among small-caps, Paladin Resources' shares jumped 10 percent after the UK 
oil explorer said that major shareholder U.S. oil giant Enron had sold the 
whole of its 40-million-share stake via HSBC bank for 44 pence a share. 
Britain's Litho Supplies Plc slumped 42.5 percent after the company, which 
supplies printing and graphic arts products, said that sales in the first six 
months of 2001 were on target, but profits would likely be below expectations 
due to tough market conditions and pressure on margins.

Futures Contract Covering Coal Debuts in New York (Correct)

Futures Contract Covering Coal Debuts in New York (Correct)

     (Corrects location of FirstEnergy Corp. in 10th paragraph of
story that moved yesterday.)

     New York, July 12 (Bloomberg) -- The New York Mercantile
Exchange today began trading a futures contract for low-sulfur
coal, a fuel that President George W. Bush said will play a major
role in meeting electricity demand over the next two decades.
     The contract's debut came after prices for coal, considered
the dirtiest of power-plant fuels, doubled in the past year, as
demand from power plants outstripped mine production. Coal for
September delivery opened at $42 a ton and settled at $40.75, as
98 contracts were traded, exchange officials said.
     ``We had a big run-up in coal prices this past winter,'' said
Andy Ozley, who buys coal for Atlanta-based Mirant Corp.'s six
coal plants in New York, Illinois, Maryland and Virginia. ``This
contract affords us a way to mitigate our exposure'' to large
price swings.
     The Bush administration said in an energy policy report this
spring that coal would be the dominant fuel for electricity
generation through 2020. Bush gave an added boost to the fuel when
he retreated from a campaign pledge to restrict carbon dioxide
emissions, implicated in global warming.
     Coal plants are responsible for a third of the nation's
carbon dioxide emissions. They also produce sulfur dioxide, which
causes acid rain, and nitrogen oxides, which cause smog.
     The Nymex started the futures contract to give mining
companies and utilities a way to hedge their risks in the $33
billion coal market. Producers such as Peabody Energy Corp. and
Arch Coal Inc., whose shares have soared in the past year, have
said they would trade the futures.

                            New Plants

     Last year's quadrupling of prices for natural gas -- a
cleaner-burning power-plant fuel -- prompted many generators to
ramp up output from their coal plants. Utility coal stockpiles
dwindled, and prices have risen to their highest levels since at
least 1989.
     So far this year, more than a dozen companies have announced
plans to build coal-fired plants, including Kansas City, Missouri-
based Kansas City Power & Light Co. and Portland, Oregon-based
PacifiCorp.
     Although coal is used to produce 52 percent of the nation's
electricity, few plants were built during the 1990s because of the
high costs of building them and the difficulty of complying with
federal and local environmental regulations.
     Demand for coal has eased in recent weeks as below-normal
temperatures in the U.S. Midwest and Northeast reduced demand for
air conditioning, said Jim Parks, who buys coal for six power
plants in Ohio and Pennsylvania as director of fuels at Akron,
Ohio-based FirstEnergy Corp.
     ``The summer's been pretty mild so far -- you haven't seen
any big heat waves'' in regions with the most coal generation, he
said.

                           Big Sandy

     The Nymex futures contract calls for the delivery of 1,550
tons of low-sulfur coal to the mouth of the Big Sandy River near
Huntington, West Virginia. From there, the fuel would be loaded
onto Ohio River barges and shipped to power plants in the U.S. and
possibly Europe.
     The new contract is tailored to producers in Appalachian
states that account for about 40 percent of U.S. production,
including West Virginia, Kentucky and Pennsylvania, the No. 2, 3
and 4 coal producers.
     The industry lacks a futures contract for coal from Western
states that account for 47 percent of the nation's production,
including the No. 1 producer, Wyoming.

                         Avoiding the Past

     The exchange, which earns commissions on trades, hopes coal
futures will avoid the fate of other contracts it has started over
the past few years. Its six electricity futures contracts have
fizzled, as has its Middle East sour crude oil contract, which
debuted in May 2000.
     ``I said yesterday, if you traded 100 to 200 contracts, that
would be a really a good day,'' said Chris Casale, vice president
of energy trading at Dynegy Inc. in Houston, which trades coal and
buys the fuel for its six power plants in New York and Illinois.
``It came out sort of on target.''
     Most of today's trading was originated by large energy
marketing companies, he said, although he declined to say whether
Dynegy traded any contracts. Enron Corp., the largest energy
trader, and Duke Energy Corp., the largest U.S.-based utility
holding company, have said they would trade coal futures.
     Exchange officials have said the coal market has the
potential to reach 5,000 trades a day after a year of trading.
     The Nymex's 17-year-old crude oil futures contract averages
about 66,700 trades a day, and its 11-year-old natural gas
contract averages about 33,500.

                           Wary of Coal

     ``The coal market is still lacking liquidity,'' said Anthony
McAuley, a floor broker at ABN Amro Inc., who said he bought five
coal contracts for a client at $42 a ton -- the market's first
transaction. ``You probably need to see a little more
participation'' from industry coal buyers and sellers for the
market to take off.
     Independent floor traders, known as locals, are wary of
trading coal futures without assurances that the industry will be
active as well.
     ``Floor traders lost millions'' in electricity futures when
some were caught with high-priced contracts and nobody in the
industry to sell them to, he said.
     ``Because of that, people are a little bit tentative about
coal,'' said Tom Schiff, an independent crude oil trader. ``We're
here to help make liquidity but we can't tackle all the risk.''






		
		
		
		Modern Metals, July 2001

		
		
		Giant energy concern now turns its attention to steel. The company's 
aggressive posture has begged controversy. Industry reactions vary from 
hand-wringing to open arms. Still others characterize Enron as a "non-event."
		By Michelle
Martinez Arjona,
Editor-in-Chief,
and Paul Hohl,
Contributing Editor
		
		These days, saying the word "Enron" in a room full of metals executives is 
like screaming "fire" in a crowded theater. For most in the steel industry, 
the idea of a futures market is enough to raise a few eyebrows. But when a 
major market maker with annual revenues of 10 times the market cap of the 
U.S. steelmaking industry stakes a claim (for 2000 alone, Enron logged 
revenues of $101 billion--that's with a "b"), a lot more than eyebrows are 
likely to be raised. After a bold presentation from Jeff McMahon, president 
and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets, at the SSCI annual convention in May (in 
which he accused steel mills of treating their service center customers as 
"annoyances"), industry leaders rushed to understand this latest market 
contender. 
		Friend or foe? Competitor or partner? These are just a couple of the 
questions surrounding Enron's aggressive push into the metals industry. 
Judging from the service center and mill executives Modern Metals queried, 
there are as many answers as there are opinions in the industry. Reactions 
ranged from fear to acceptance to downright resentment. At least one mill was 
reticent to discuss Enron at all--still others seemed to meet the issue with 
unaffected shrugs. If the saying is true that all publicity is good 
publicity, the buzz that Enron has generated would make even a Hollywood spin 
doctor envious.
		What's the hubbub?
Although products such as natural gas and energy--Enron's major business 
platform--have been traded as commodities for years, until Enron's appearance 
a formal forward market for steel has never existed. According to McMahon, 
the absence of a liquid and transparent market has resulted in "uninformed 
investment decisions" that have exacerbated the current oversupply situation, 
and left companies exposed to the hazards of price volatility. 
		Enron's answer is to offer a variety of financial hedging products along with 
forward contracts in hot-rolled, cold-rolled and galvanized (plate and long 
products are soon to follow), locking in prices for as many as five years 
out. Enron contends that it can act as a "risk intermediary" in steel 
transactions, ensuring healthier profit margins and lowering the cost of 
capital. Certain grades of steel are commodities, McMahon insists, and as 
such should be bought and sold on a commodity market basis, instead of the 
strategic relationships that now exist between the mills and consumers. Enron 
has been offering steel online, and via phone and fax, since November of last 
year.
		"Before you add capacity, before you make an investment decision, you'll be 
able to see a three, five, maybe even a 10-year forward price of steel," 
McMahon stated, "and if you want to hedge that investment you can do that."
		The company plans to buy steel at a floating price and then sell it to steel 
consumers at a fixed rate, making money on the spread. In February, Greg 
Hermans, VP of steel trading at Enron, reported to AMM that it was offering 
U.S.-made 10-gauge, 48-in. wide hot-rolled for April delivery in Chicago for 
$225 a ton. Hermans said Enron was buying the same product for April delivery 
at $215 a ton. 
		Eventually, Enron sees the development of four different marketplaces: the 
Northeast, the Midwest (or Chicago area), the Gulf Coast (or Houston area), 
and the West Coast. Enron will hedge against spot price spikes through equity 
and physical holdings in domestic mills. The company closed on Huntco's 
Arkansas-based cold-rolling mill in June.
		"It's a big portfolio," McMahon said. "We wanted to put together a portfolio 
of supply and demand. In some cases, we'll own assets--hopefully we'll own 
some term contracts with domestic mills. To the extent that imports are a 
part of the equation, we'll be a part of that market. We may purchase 
capacity from somebody, not necessarily the assets, but toll slab through a 
hot strip mill. All of those combined is how we do our business."
		Steel mills can benefit, McMahon said, by entering into a multi-year 
"physical off take" with Enron, thus giving steel mills a degree of certain 
volume and on product specification. Enron would guarantee purchase of a 
specified amount of tonnage, and use a floating price or a floor price to 
guard against market shocks. Whether mills would be willing to divert 
capacity to the commodity grades being bought and sold by Enron remains 
uncertain. At least one mill executive privately said no . . . at least for 
now.
		Nucor president, CEO and vice chairman, Dan DiMicco also sees little value in 
Enron's proposal. "What we need to have is stable pricing at levels where the 
most efficient mills can make a good return on their capital and further 
invest in new technologies and equipment," he stated. "I define true value as 
helping the industry to become stronger. It doesn't do any good to maintain a 
lack of price volatility at $200 a ton."
		Keith Busse, CEO at Steel Dynamics, echoed that sentiment in a recent New 
Steel article. "If you're trying to get volatility out at $320 [per ton], 
great," he said. "But at $230, you want to stick your fingers down your 
throat."
		For the service centers
Service centers, McMahon suggested, could benefit immediately. "The only way 
[distributors] are able to hedge themselves is to go out and buy inventory," 
he explained. "That takes capital, and cash, and space. We can offer a 
financial product that gives the exact same protection, but doesn't require 
any of the above.
		"We can hold those inventories and price the steel at the time of delivery to 
the service centers," he continued, "so their 4- or 5- percent net margins 
are somewhat certain."
		"I do think that Enron is providing a service for the industry . . . " 
commented Dave Lerman, CEO of Steel Warehouse, South Bend, Indiana. But he 
pointed out that "how [it] moves forward will be interesting. If they just 
move forward with hedge instruments . . . that's independent of whether you 
run your business well by having a good supplier that matches up with the 
demands of your customers. I think [Enron] will be a good thing for some 
people and a non-event for others."
		Beyond hedging, McMahon pointed out, firm and enforceable contracts could 
become a key benefit to service centers. As one Midwestern distributor source 
commented, "One of the terrible things that happens in our business is that 
end users demand long-term pricing, beyond what anybody can foresee. When 
they anticipate the market is going up, or that it has hit a low point, they 
push harder for it--as any one would. But historically, they don't honor the 
deals." 
		In a down market, he explained, customers demand lower prices. Noncompliance 
can result in orders, but no releases, and a "don't call us, we'll call you" 
attitude from customers. The consequence for service centers, he said, are 
price reductions on the way down and on the way up. "If Enron brings 
integrity to both sides of this market," he concluded, "that would be a very 
big plus for the steel industry."
		But integrity, another Midwest service center exec countered, has got nothing 
to do with it. In his estimation, Enron is like a profiteering carpetbagger, 
"trying to make a buck in between the producer and the user. That's all we 
need right now," he declared, "somebody trying to squeeze out a few more 
dollars." But, he recognized, "we're all going to have to deal with it."
		Don McNeeley, president and CEO of Chicago Tube & Iron, indicated that some 
good could come of a heavy-hitter like Enron introducing new ideas into the 
industry, but acknowledged that people might be offended by somebody picking 
the so-called "low-hanging fruit" of the steel market in the current economy. 
"What do you think the mills are going to do when you come to them for just 
the peripheral items?" he queried. "My concern would be that the price would 
go up on [those items]."
		McNeeley also questioned the wisdom of distributors relinquishing control of 
their inventories. "In distribution, 60 percent of our net worth is 
inventory, 30 percent is accounts receivable, and 10 percent is plant 
property and equipment," he related. "Our single largest asset is our 
inventory. If a distribution company surrenders control of its inventory to a 
third party, does not that distributor, in effect, surrender its own 
sovereignty?"
		Only just begun
Questions abound regarding Enron's role as a physical supplier of steel as 
well. As one Minnesota-based service center exec put it, "are they ready to 
deal with problems?"
		Although Enron has expressed interest in being a physical supplier, Dave 
Lerman explained, "I think that's going to be a lot more difficult to 
implement." Enron would have to consider specific qualities, coil sizes, 
nuances of chemistry, surface quality, and formability. "Most customers 
require better than standard tolerances," he pointed out. "These are all 
issues that might complicate commodity sales."
		Delivery is another issue. As a physical supplier, Enron has virtually 
guaranteed just-in-time delivery, but as one service center source said, "the 
guarantee is good when the material shows up at my door. What happens if it 
doesn't show up? I disappoint a customer. What good does it do to sue [Enron] 
if I've lost a customer?"
		Mill executives have questioned whether Enron is a potential competitor. 
"They see Enron as someone likely to buy foreign steel in order to deliver it 
to a U.S. customer," said Chuck Bradford, principal of Bradford Research and 
a long-time industry observer. He cautioned against seeing Enron as too much 
of a physical supplier, speculating that the future of Enron, similar to the 
LME, will be in hedging. "You may see some [physical transactions] to start 
with," Bradford predicted, "just to get the ball rolling. But I don't see 
that as the way the market will develop."
		McMahon has been consistent in saying that Enron has little interest in 
becoming a steel manufacturer. The real value, he said, is in a transparent, 
liquid market. "We know the products work, we know the market wants them. Can 
any one particular mill or mills prevent that? We don't think so," he said. 
"It's not an 'if', it's a 'when'."
		The jury is still out on just how soon that "when" will come, and what those 
effects will be for the steel industry. And for all of the debate surrounding 
the issue, it seems a bit soon to be hitting the panic button. As Don 
McNeeley recounted, "I can recall similar controversy over a speech a guy 
gave about 15-17 years ago. That guy's name was Ken Iverson, and he had this 
concept called a mini-mill. Look at it now."

Wisconsin Gas to Purchase Nine Mile Line From Northern Natural Gas

Line Will Enhance Competition in Southeast Wisconsin and Use Existing 
Facilities 

MILWAUKEE, July 13 /PRNewswire/ -- Wisconsin Gas, Northern Natural Gas and 
Guardian Pipeline announced today that Wisconsin Gas has signed an agreement 
with Northern Natural Gas (NNG) to purchase a nine mile, high pressure 
natural gas pipeline in Walworth and Waukesha counties. The purchase price is 
$5 million. The proposed transaction will require approval from federal and 
state regulators. The pipe, known as the Eagle line, is located southeast of 
the Kettle Moraine Forest near Eagle, Wis.
The existing line has been part of the NNG interstate transmission system. 
Under the new ownership, the line will become part of the Wisconsin Gas 
distribution system and will interconnect with Guardian Pipeline as well as 
the NNG system. 
"Northern Natural Gas is pleased to be a part of a creative, cost-effective 
solution to provide additional gas service to southeastern Wisconsin," said 
Dave Neubauer, vice president of business development and marketing, Northern 
Natural Gas. "This transaction enables Wisconsin Gas and its customers to 
obtain natural gas supplies from Guardian or NNG. Providing reliable, 
economical choices for consumers will benefit all of the parties involved." 
"We saw this as an opportunity to minimize environmental impact and still 
realize the benefits of increased competition in the natural gas market," 
said James Schott, senior vice president, Wisconsin Gas. "The purchase of the 
Eagle line will enable Wisconsin Gas to further our goal of providing 
cost-efficient natural gas service to our customers." 
As a result of the purchase Guardian Pipeline, the 141-mile interstate 
pipeline from Joliet, Ill. to Ixonia, Wis., will no longer build an 8.5-mile 
lateral to Eagle. The lateral was part of the originally certified Guardian 
Pipeline. This portion of the line would have generally run parallel to the 
current Northern Natural pipeline. 
"This sale is a win-win situation for Guardian and consumers," said George 
Hass, project manager of Guardian Pipeline. "The Eagle line purchase by 
Wisconsin Gas saves Guardian time and resources by taking away the need to 
build the 8.5-mile lateral and allows all three companies to create a better 
environment for competition in the natural gas marketplace." 
The existing gate stations at LaGrange and Eagle will remain in-service for 
regulation purposes. Odorization and measurement will take place at a new 
gate station that will be constructed at the interconnect with Guardian. This 
new gate station will be called the Bluff Creek station and will be located 
near Whitewater. The Bluff Creek gate station will be constructed during the 
construction of Guardian Pipeline. 
Northern Natural Gas, a subsidiary of Enron Corp., with a market area 
capacity of about 4.3 Bcf/d, provides natural gas transportation services to 
utility customers in the upper Midwestern United States through its 
approximately 16,000 miles of pipeline. 
Guardian Pipeline is a partnership of three Midwestern energy companies: CMS 
Energy, based in Dearborn, Mich.; Wisconsin Energy, headquartered in 
Milwaukee, Wis.; and Viking Gas Transmission Co., a wholly owned subsidiary 
of Xcel Energy Inc., and located in St. Paul, Minn. 
Wisconsin Electric-Wisconsin Gas, the principal utility subsidiary of 
Wisconsin Energy Corp. (NYSE: WEC), serves more than one million electric 
customers and more than 960,000 natural gas customers throughout Wisconsin 
and Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Visit our company's Web site at

Commodities Review: LME Copper Hit By Another Stock Rise
By Mark Long and Steve McGrath
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

07/13/2001
Dow Jones Commodities Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- Copper futures traded in London fell Friday, as a 
further influx of stocks into official warehouses put the copper market under 
pressure and dragged down the rest of the base metal complex. 
Three-month copper traded on the London Metal Exchange ended $6 down from 
Thursday's late kerb close at $1,554.50 a metric ton.
An increase of 7,475 tons of copper into LME warehouses Friday brought total 
stocks up to a 12-month high of 550,300 tons. This pressured prices in early 
trade down to test $1,550/ton support, although prices recovered slightly in 
later trade. 
Unconfirmed market talk said Enron is behind much of the week's stock rise, 
in an effort to ease nearby supply tightness and to alleviate the large short 
positions it is thought to have built up on the July-for-a-week spread, which 
is currently showing a $6-$8/ton backwardation. The July futures contract 
will switch over to cash Monday. 
Enron declined to comment on the market talk Friday. 
A backwardation is a pricing structure in which deliveries to be made in the 
near future are more expensive then those set for a more distant delivery. 
The opposite situation is called contango. 
"The spreads are still tight. The major longs are still reluctant to lend, 
with no signs of that (tightness) dissipated," said Kevin Norrish, an analyst 
with Barclays Capital in London. 
Dealers and analysts said they expect further stock increases next week. 
The entire base metals complex ignored Thursday's 237-point rally in the Dow 
Jones Industrial Average, dealers said. 
"Copper has been sensitive to moves in the stock market, but not this time," 
Norrish said. In fact, now it appears that base metals markets ignore 
equities markets when they rally, but follow stocks down when they slump, he 
added. 
European Grain Futures See Profit-Taking, But More Gains Expected 
European grain and oilseed futures were hit by a bout of profit-taking and 
pre-weekend position-squaring Friday, after rising to long-time highs, 
brokers said. 
However, world and domestic crop concerns, the strength of the dollar and 
general bullish sentiment will carry the markets to fresh highs short term, 
they said. 
On the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange, the 
benchmark November feed wheat contract ended just 25 pence up at GBP82/ton, 
after hitting a new two-year high of GBP83/ton in early trade. 
Meanwhile, Matif November rapeseed futures fell EUR2.75 on the day to 
EUR265/ton, after hitting a three-year high of EUR271/ton in early trade. 
The U.K. wheat crop and the French rapeseed crop are forecast to be well down 
on last year, and wheat and canola crops in some other major producing 
countries are also expected to fall. 
Meanwhile, the strength of the dollar is allowing European grain and oilseed 
traders to up prices and still remain competitive against U.S. imports and 
dollar-denominated grains on the world market.

LME Base Metals: Copper Pressured Down By Stock Build

07/13/2001
Dow Jones Commodities Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- London Metal Exchange three-month copper ended Friday's 
late kerb lower compared with Thursday, pressured by another stock build, 
dealers said. 
(LME three-month metals prices in dollars a metric ton at 1600 GMT, with the 
previous late kerb close in parentheses. Comex copper at 1641 GMT in cents a 
pound, with the previous close in parentheses.) Copper 1,554.50 (1,560.50) 
Tin 4,452.50 (4,502.50) 
Aluminum 1,452.25 (1,458.50) Zinc 871.50 (877.50) 
Nickel 5,925.00 (6,012.50) Lead 462.50 (465.00) 
Comex Sep Copper 70.75 (70.80)
An increase of 7,475 tons of copper Friday brought total stocks up to a 
12-month high of 550,300 tons. This pressured prices in early trade down to 
test $1,550/ton support before rising slightly to close at $1,554.50/ton, 
down from Thursday's close of $1,560.50/ton. 
Unconfirmed market talk said Enron is behind much of the week's stock rise, 
in an effort to ease nearby supply tightness and to alleviate the large short 
positions it is thought to have built up on the July-for-a-week spread, which 
is currently showing a $6-$8/ton backwardation. The July futures contract 
will switch over to cash Monday. 
Enron declined to comment on the market talk. 
A backwardation is a pricing structure in which deliveries to be made in the 
near future are more expensive then those set for a more distant delivery.

"The spreads are still tight. The major longs are still reluctant to lend,

"Copper has been sensitive to moves in the stock market, but not this time," 
Norrish said. In fact, now it appears that base metals markets ignore 
equities markets when they rally, but follow stocks down when they slump, he 
added. 
Aluminum also ended the late kerb lower Friday. 
News of the restart of some smelters has dampened sentiment, despite a stock 
drawdown of around 8,000 tons since the end of last week, dealers said. 
"The stock drawdowns are fairly small percentage-wise," said Standard Bank 
analyst Robin Bhar, adding that they would need to be much larger to 
significantly improve market sentiment. 
"A test of $1,435/ton cannot be ruled out, though we would expect forward 
buying to prevent a break below this level for the time being," Barclays said 
in a market report. 
Zinc continued its slump, falling to a seven-and-a-half-year low, mainly on 
technicals. 
Technicals also hurt nickel, which rose slightly after breaking $5,900/ton 
support but still closed at its lowest level since April. 
Nickel's fall was "just on some speculative liquidation and short selling, 
mostly chart-based," Bhar said.

UK: Telecoms, drugs drive FTSE 100 rally, Vodafone leads.
By Camila Reed

07/13/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, July 13 (Reuters) - Britain's largest companies raced higher at the 
close on Friday fired by telecoms and drug stocks as they bounced back from 
Wednesday's 16-week low. 
Index heavyweights Vodafone and GlaxoSmithKline provided 27 of the day's 
55-point gain, while technology firms wobbled. However, the telecoms giant 
surged 4.1 percent to 157-1/4p.
The FTSE 100 finished 55.4 points or one percent firmer at 5,537.0, having 
jumped 1.66 percent on Thursday after seven consecutive losing sessions, with 
gainers outnumbering losers by three to one. 
Stocks steamed higher and refused to be derailed by sluggish U.S. retail 
sales figures for June, which showed only a meagre rise, and a weaker Wall 
Street, but volumes were thin at 1.4 billion shares. 
By London's 1530 GMT finish the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average was 
down five points, while the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index was flat, 
having streaked up in the previous session. 
Mike Lenhoff and Simon Rubinsohn at money managers Gerrard said that the UK 
equity market was deeply oversold and long-term this presented a buying 
opportunity for UK equities. 
DRUGS SEE-SAW 
Drugs reversed an earlier decline with Nycomed Amersham among the day's top 
performers, up nearly four percent at 536-1/2p and AstraZeneca rising over 
one percent. 
Mining giant Anglo American moved into the FTSE 100 top ten gainers with a 
three percent rise, as investors sought refuge in mining stocks as a cyclical 
play. 
Another major gainer was British business services firm Hays Plc up 3.4 
percent. The shares leapt on market talk that Germany's Deutsche Post was 
looking to make a bid for it, dealers said. 
Both Deutsche Post and Hays declined to comment. 
Firmer crude prices gave support to the oil sector. BP rose 0.6 percent to 
572 pence and Shell also added 0.6 percent to 581-1/2p lifting the index by 
four points. 
FTSE MIXED PICTURE 
But dealers and analysts said it would be a mixed picture going forward with 
the market scrutinising data for signs of a sustained economic recovery or a 
lapse in consumer confidence. 
"This week we had a really bloody day on Wednesday and then the opposite on 
Thursday, so we're going to be on a rollercoaster still. It's very fragile 
but it does show the potential of the market," said Foreign & Colonial 
director of UK equities David Manning. 
"It's not only the holiday period, it's also that the market can make you 
look an idiot one day to the next. In that sort of circumstance the 
temptation is to do very little," he said. 
ABN Amro strategist Gareth Williams said the market would make modest 
progress over the next month or so, with moves downward quite likely although 
the trend would be upwards over the course of the year. 
TECHS DIP 
Thursday's 5.3-percent rally in the Nasdaq failed to bring any cheer to UK 
technology shares. Logica and Colt Telecom slid four percent, while microchip 
designer ARM fell 3.9 percent to 223 pence trimming Thursday's 13 percent 
jump. 
The techMARK index of technology shares rose 0.98 percent to 1,602.87. 
Elsewhere on the downside, UK holiday operator Airtours lost nearly 10 
percent of its value after Swiss peer Kuoni issued a profit warning. 
Among second liners, Baltimore Technologies closed up 3.3 percent. It 
initially rallied 22 percent after the Irish Internet security firm said it 
received an approach from an unlisted British-based company for an all-paper 
deal to combine the companies. 
The FTSE 250 Mid-cap index finished 5.1 points stronger at 6,163.8. 
Among small-caps, Paladin Resources' shares jumped 10 percent after the UK 
oil explorer said that major shareholder U.S. oil giant Enron had sold the 
whole of its 40-million-share stake via HSBC bank for 44 pence a share. 
Britain's Litho Supplies Plc slumped 42.5 percent after the company, which 
supplies printing and graphic arts products, said that sales in the first six 
months of 2001 were on target, but profits would likely be below expectations 
due to tough market conditions and pressure on margins.

Futures Contract Covering Coal Debuts in New York (Correct)

Futures Contract Covering Coal Debuts in New York (Correct)

     (Corrects location of FirstEnergy Corp. in 10th paragraph of
story that moved yesterday.)

     New York, July 12 (Bloomberg) -- The New York Mercantile
Exchange today began trading a futures contract for low-sulfur
coal, a fuel that President George W. Bush said will play a major
role in meeting electricity demand over the next two decades.
     The contract's debut came after prices for coal, considered
the dirtiest of power-plant fuels, doubled in the past year, as
demand from power plants outstripped mine production. Coal for
September delivery opened at $42 a ton and settled at $40.75, as
98 contracts were traded, exchange officials said.
     ``We had a big run-up in coal prices this past winter,'' said
Andy Ozley, who buys coal for Atlanta-based Mirant Corp.'s six
coal plants in New York, Illinois, Maryland and Virginia. ``This
contract affords us a way to mitigate our exposure'' to large
price swings.
     The Bush administration said in an energy policy report this
spring that coal would be the dominant fuel for electricity
generation through 2020. Bush gave an added boost to the fuel when
he retreated from a campaign pledge to restrict carbon dioxide
emissions, implicated in global warming.
     Coal plants are responsible for a third of the nation's
carbon dioxide emissions. They also produce sulfur dioxide, which
causes acid rain, and nitrogen oxides, which cause smog.
     The Nymex started the futures contract to give mining
companies and utilities a way to hedge their risks in the $33
billion coal market. Producers such as Peabody Energy Corp. and
Arch Coal Inc., whose shares have soared in the past year, have
said they would trade the futures.

                            New Plants

     Last year's quadrupling of prices for natural gas -- a
cleaner-burning power-plant fuel -- prompted many generators to
ramp up output from their coal plants. Utility coal stockpiles
dwindled, and prices have risen to their highest levels since at
least 1989.
     So far this year, more than a dozen companies have announced
plans to build coal-fired plants, including Kansas City, Missouri-
based Kansas City Power & Light Co. and Portland, Oregon-based
PacifiCorp.
     Although coal is used to produce 52 percent of the nation's
electricity, few plants were built during the 1990s because of the
high costs of building them and the difficulty of complying with
federal and local environmental regulations.
     Demand for coal has eased in recent weeks as below-normal
temperatures in the U.S. Midwest and Northeast reduced demand for
air conditioning, said Jim Parks, who buys coal for six power
plants in Ohio and Pennsylvania as director of fuels at Akron,
Ohio-based FirstEnergy Corp.
     ``The summer's been pretty mild so far -- you haven't seen
any big heat waves'' in regions with the most coal generation, he
said.

                           Big Sandy

     The Nymex futures contract calls for the delivery of 1,550
tons of low-sulfur coal to the mouth of the Big Sandy River near
Huntington, West Virginia. From there, the fuel would be loaded
onto Ohio River barges and shipped to power plants in the U.S. and
possibly Europe.
     The new contract is tailored to producers in Appalachian
states that account for about 40 percent of U.S. production,
including West Virginia, Kentucky and Pennsylvania, the No. 2, 3
and 4 coal producers.
     The industry lacks a futures contract for coal from Western
states that account for 47 percent of the nation's production,
including the No. 1 producer, Wyoming.

                         Avoiding the Past

     The exchange, which earns commissions on trades, hopes coal
futures will avoid the fate of other contracts it has started over
the past few years. Its six electricity futures contracts have
fizzled, as has its Middle East sour crude oil contract, which
debuted in May 2000.
     ``I said yesterday, if you traded 100 to 200 contracts, that
would be a really a good day,'' said Chris Casale, vice president
of energy trading at Dynegy Inc. in Houston, which trades coal and
buys the fuel for its six power plants in New York and Illinois.
``It came out sort of on target.''
     Most of today's trading was originated by large energy
marketing companies, he said, although he declined to say whether
Dynegy traded any contracts. Enron Corp., the largest energy
trader, and Duke Energy Corp., the largest U.S.-based utility
holding company, have said they would trade coal futures.
     Exchange officials have said the coal market has the
potential to reach 5,000 trades a day after a year of trading.
     The Nymex's 17-year-old crude oil futures contract averages
about 66,700 trades a day, and its 11-year-old natural gas
contract averages about 33,500.

                           Wary of Coal

     ``The coal market is still lacking liquidity,'' said Anthony
McAuley, a floor broker at ABN Amro Inc., who said he bought five
coal contracts for a client at $42 a ton -- the market's first
transaction. ``You probably need to see a little more
participation'' from industry coal buyers and sellers for the
market to take off.
     Independent floor traders, known as locals, are wary of
trading coal futures without assurances that the industry will be
active as well.
     ``Floor traders lost millions'' in electricity futures when
some were caught with high-priced contracts and nobody in the
industry to sell them to, he said.
     ``Because of that, people are a little bit tentative about
coal,'' said Tom Schiff, an independent crude oil trader. ``We're
here to help make liquidity but we can't tackle all the risk.''






		
		
		
		Modern Metals, July 2001

		
		
		Giant energy concern now turns its attention to steel. The company's 
aggressive posture has begged controversy. Industry reactions vary from 
hand-wringing to open arms. Still others characterize Enron as a "non-event."
		By Michelle
Martinez Arjona,
Editor-in-Chief,
and Paul Hohl,
Contributing Editor
		
		These days, saying the word "Enron" in a room full of metals executives is 
like screaming "fire" in a crowded theater. For most in the steel industry, 
the idea of a futures market is enough to raise a few eyebrows. But when a 
major market maker with annual revenues of 10 times the market cap of the 
U.S. steelmaking industry stakes a claim (for 2000 alone, Enron logged 
revenues of $101 billion--that's with a "b"), a lot more than eyebrows are 
likely to be raised. After a bold presentation from Jeff McMahon, president 
and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets, at the SSCI annual convention in May (in 
which he accused steel mills of treating their service center customers as 
"annoyances"), industry leaders rushed to understand this latest market 
contender. 
		Friend or foe? Competitor or partner? These are just a couple of the 
questions surrounding Enron's aggressive push into the metals industry. 
Judging from the service center and mill executives Modern Metals queried, 
there are as many answers as there are opinions in the industry. Reactions 
ranged from fear to acceptance to downright resentment. At least one mill was 
reticent to discuss Enron at all--still others seemed to meet the issue with 
unaffected shrugs. If the saying is true that all publicity is good 
publicity, the buzz that Enron has generated would make even a Hollywood spin 
doctor envious.
		What's the hubbub?
Although products such as natural gas and energy--Enron's major business 
platform--have been traded as commodities for years, until Enron's appearance 
a formal forward market for steel has never existed. According to McMahon, 
the absence of a liquid and transparent market has resulted in "uninformed 
investment decisions" that have exacerbated the current oversupply situation, 
and left companies exposed to the hazards of price volatility. 
		Enron's answer is to offer a variety of financial hedging products along with 
forward contracts in hot-rolled, cold-rolled and galvanized (plate and long 
products are soon to follow), locking in prices for as many as five years 
out. Enron contends that it can act as a "risk intermediary" in steel 
transactions, ensuring healthier profit margins and lowering the cost of 
capital. Certain grades of steel are commodities, McMahon insists, and as 
such should be bought and sold on a commodity market basis, instead of the 
strategic relationships that now exist between the mills and consumers. Enron 
has been offering steel online, and via phone and fax, since November of last 
year.
		"Before you add capacity, before you make an investment decision, you'll be 
able to see a three, five, maybe even a 10-year forward price of steel," 
McMahon stated, "and if you want to hedge that investment you can do that."
		The company plans to buy steel at a floating price and then sell it to steel 
consumers at a fixed rate, making money on the spread. In February, Greg 
Hermans, VP of steel trading at Enron, reported to AMM that it was offering 
U.S.-made 10-gauge, 48-in. wide hot-rolled for April delivery in Chicago for 
$225 a ton. Hermans said Enron was buying the same product for April delivery 
at $215 a ton. 
		Eventually, Enron sees the development of four different marketplaces: the 
Northeast, the Midwest (or Chicago area), the Gulf Coast (or Houston area), 
and the West Coast. Enron will hedge against spot price spikes through equity 
and physical holdings in domestic mills. The company closed on Huntco's 
Arkansas-based cold-rolling mill in June.
		"It's a big portfolio," McMahon said. "We wanted to put together a portfolio 
of supply and demand. In some cases, we'll own assets--hopefully we'll own 
some term contracts with domestic mills. To the extent that imports are a 
part of the equation, we'll be a part of that market. We may purchase 
capacity from somebody, not necessarily the assets, but toll slab through a 
hot strip mill. All of those combined is how we do our business."
		Steel mills can benefit, McMahon said, by entering into a multi-year 
"physical off take" with Enron, thus giving steel mills a degree of certain 
volume and on product specification. Enron would guarantee purchase of a 
specified amount of tonnage, and use a floating price or a floor price to 
guard against market shocks. Whether mills would be willing to divert 
capacity to the commodity grades being bought and sold by Enron remains 
uncertain. At least one mill executive privately said no . . . at least for 
now.
		Nucor president, CEO and vice chairman, Dan DiMicco also sees little value in 
Enron's proposal. "What we need to have is stable pricing at levels where the 
most efficient mills can make a good return on their capital and further 
invest in new technologies and equipment," he stated. "I define true value as 
helping the industry to become stronger. It doesn't do any good to maintain a 
lack of price volatility at $200 a ton."
		Keith Busse, CEO at Steel Dynamics, echoed that sentiment in a recent New 
Steel article. "If you're trying to get volatility out at $320 [per ton], 
great," he said. "But at $230, you want to stick your fingers down your 
throat."
		For the service centers
Service centers, McMahon suggested, could benefit immediately. "The only way 
[distributors] are able to hedge themselves is to go out and buy inventory," 
he explained. "That takes capital, and cash, and space. We can offer a 
financial product that gives the exact same protection, but doesn't require 
any of the above.
		"We can hold those inventories and price the steel at the time of delivery to 
the service centers," he continued, "so their 4- or 5- percent net margins 
are somewhat certain."
		"I do think that Enron is providing a service for the industry . . . " 
commented Dave Lerman, CEO of Steel Warehouse, South Bend, Indiana. But he 
pointed out that "how [it] moves forward will be interesting. If they just 
move forward with hedge instruments . . . that's independent of whether you 
run your business well by having a good supplier that matches up with the 
demands of your customers. I think [Enron] will be a good thing for some 
people and a non-event for others."
		Beyond hedging, McMahon pointed out, firm and enforceable contracts could 
become a key benefit to service centers. As one Midwestern distributor source 
commented, "One of the terrible things that happens in our business is that 
end users demand long-term pricing, beyond what anybody can foresee. When 
they anticipate the market is going up, or that it has hit a low point, they 
push harder for it--as any one would. But historically, they don't honor the 
deals." 
		In a down market, he explained, customers demand lower prices. Noncompliance 
can result in orders, but no releases, and a "don't call us, we'll call you" 
attitude from customers. The consequence for service centers, he said, are 
price reductions on the way down and on the way up. "If Enron brings 
integrity to both sides of this market," he concluded, "that would be a very 
big plus for the steel industry."
		But integrity, another Midwest service center exec countered, has got nothing 
to do with it. In his estimation, Enron is like a profiteering carpetbagger, 
"trying to make a buck in between the producer and the user. That's all we 
need right now," he declared, "somebody trying to squeeze out a few more 
dollars." But, he recognized, "we're all going to have to deal with it."
		Don McNeeley, president and CEO of Chicago Tube & Iron, indicated that some 
good could come of a heavy-hitter like Enron introducing new ideas into the 
industry, but acknowledged that people might be offended by somebody picking 
the so-called "low-hanging fruit" of the steel market in the current economy. 
"What do you think the mills are going to do when you come to them for just 
the peripheral items?" he queried. "My concern would be that the price would 
go up on [those items]."
		McNeeley also questioned the wisdom of distributors relinquishing control of 
their inventories. "In distribution, 60 percent of our net worth is 
inventory, 30 percent is accounts receivable, and 10 percent is plant 
property and equipment," he related. "Our single largest asset is our 
inventory. If a distribution company surrenders control of its inventory to a 
third party, does not that distributor, in effect, surrender its own 
sovereignty?"
		Only just begun
Questions abound regarding Enron's role as a physical supplier of steel as 
well. As one Minnesota-based service center exec put it, "are they ready to 
deal with problems?"
		Although Enron has expressed interest in being a physical supplier, Dave 
Lerman explained, "I think that's going to be a lot more difficult to 
implement." Enron would have to consider specific qualities, coil sizes, 
nuances of chemistry, surface quality, and formability. "Most customers 
require better than standard tolerances," he pointed out. "These are all 
issues that might complicate commodity sales."
		Delivery is another issue. As a physical supplier, Enron has virtually 
guaranteed just-in-time delivery, but as one service center source said, "the 
guarantee is good when the material shows up at my door. What happens if it 
doesn't show up? I disappoint a customer. What good does it do to sue [Enron] 
if I've lost a customer?"
		Mill executives have questioned whether Enron is a potential competitor. 
"They see Enron as someone likely to buy foreign steel in order to deliver it 
to a U.S. customer," said Chuck Bradford, principal of Bradford Research and 
a long-time industry observer. He cautioned against seeing Enron as too much 
of a physical supplier, speculating that the future of Enron, similar to the 
LME, will be in hedging. "You may see some [physical transactions] to start 
with," Bradford predicted, "just to get the ball rolling. But I don't see 
that as the way the market will develop."
		McMahon has been consistent in saying that Enron has little interest in 
becoming a steel manufacturer. The real value, he said, is in a transparent, 
liquid market. "We know the products work, we know the market wants them. Can 
any one particular mill or mills prevent that? We don't think so," he said. 
"It's not an 'if', it's a 'when'."
		The jury is still out on just how soon that "when" will come, and what those 
effects will be for the steel industry. And for all of the debate surrounding 
the issue, it seems a bit soon to be hitting the panic button. As Don 
McNeeley recounted, "I can recall similar controversy over a speech a guy 
gave about 15-17 years ago. That guy's name was Ken Iverson, and he had this 
concept called a mini-mill. Look at it now."

(Copyright (c) 2001, PR Newswire)

Line Will Enhance Competition in Southeast Wisconsin and Use Existing 
Facilities 

MILWAUKEE, July 13 /PRNewswire/ -- Wisconsin Gas, Northern Natural Gas and Guardian Pipeline announced today that Wisconsin Gas has signed an agreement with Northern Natural Gas (NNG) to purchase a nine mile, high pressure natural gas pipeline in Walworth and Waukesha counties. The purchase price is $5 million. The proposed transaction will require approval from federal and state regulators. The pipe, known as the Eagle line, is located southeast of the Kettle Moraine Forest near Eagle, Wis.
The existing line has been part of the NNG interstate transmission system. Under the new ownership, the line will become part of the Wisconsin Gas distribution system and will interconnect with Guardian Pipeline as well as the NNG system. 
"Northern Natural Gas is pleased to be a part of a creative, cost-effective solution to provide additional gas service to southeastern Wisconsin," said Dave Neubauer, vice president of business development and marketing, Northern Natural Gas. "This transaction enables Wisconsin Gas and its customers to obtain natural gas supplies from Guardian or NNG. Providing reliable, economical choices for consumers will benefit all of the parties involved." 
"We saw this as an opportunity to minimize environmental impact and still realize the benefits of increased competition in the natural gas market," said James Schott, senior vice president, Wisconsin Gas. "The purchase of the Eagle line will enable Wisconsin Gas to further our goal of providing cost-efficient natural gas service to our customers." 
As a result of the purchase Guardian Pipeline, the 141-mile interstate pipeline from Joliet, Ill. to Ixonia, Wis., will no longer build an 8.5-mile lateral to Eagle. The lateral was part of the originally certified Guardian Pipeline. This portion of the line would have generally run parallel to the current Northern Natural pipeline. 
"This sale is a win-win situation for Guardian and consumers," said George Hass, project manager of Guardian Pipeline. "The Eagle line purchase by Wisconsin Gas saves Guardian time and resources by taking away the need to build the 8.5-mile lateral and allows all three companies to create a better environment for competition in the natural gas marketplace." 
The existing gate stations at LaGrange and Eagle will remain in-service for regulation purposes. Odorization and measurement will take place at a new gate station that will be constructed at the interconnect with Guardian. This new gate station will be called the Bluff Creek station and will be located near Whitewater. The Bluff Creek gate station will be constructed during the construction of Guardian Pipeline. 
Northern Natural Gas, a subsidiary of Enron Corp., with a market area capacity of about 4.3 Bcf/d, provides natural gas transportation services to utility customers in the upper Midwestern United States through its approximately 16,000 miles of pipeline. 
Guardian Pipeline is a partnership of three Midwestern energy companies: CMS Energy, based in Dearborn, Mich.; Wisconsin Energy, headquartered in Milwaukee, Wis.; and Viking Gas Transmission Co., a wholly owned subsidiary of Xcel Energy Inc., and located in St. Paul, Minn. 
Wisconsin Electric-Wisconsin Gas, the principal utility subsidiary of Wisconsin Energy Corp. (NYSE: WEC), serves more than one million electric customers and more than 960,000 natural gas customers throughout Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula.

Commodities Review: LME Copper Hit By Another Stock Rise
By Mark Long and Steve McGrath
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

07/13/2001

(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- Copper futures traded in London fell Friday, as a further influx of stocks into official warehouses put the copper market under pressure and dragged down the rest of the base metal complex. 
Three-month copper traded on the London Metal Exchange ended $6 down from Thursday's late kerb close at $1,554.50 a metric ton.
An increase of 7,475 tons of copper into LME warehouses Friday brought total stocks up to a 12-month high of 550,300 tons. This pressured prices in early trade down to test $1,550/ton support, although prices recovered slightly in later trade. 
Unconfirmed market talk said Enron is behind much of the week's stock rise, in an effort to ease nearby supply tightness and to alleviate the large short positions it is thought to have built up on the July-for-a-week spread, which is currently showing a $6-$8/ton backwardation. The July futures contract will switch over to cash Monday. 
Enron declined to comment on the market talk Friday. 
A backwardation is a pricing structure in which deliveries to be made in the near future are more expensive then those set for a more distant delivery. The opposite situation is called contango. 
"The spreads are still tight. The major longs are still reluctant to lend, with no signs of that (tightness) dissipated," said Kevin Norrish, an analyst with Barclays Capital in London. 
Dealers and analysts said they expect further stock increases next week. 
The entire base metals complex ignored Thursday's 237-point rally in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, dealers said. 
"Copper has been sensitive to moves in the stock market, but not this time," Norrish said. In fact, now it appears that base metals markets ignore equities markets when they rally, but follow stocks down when they slump, he added. 
European Grain Futures See Profit-Taking, But More Gains Expected 
European grain and oilseed futures were hit by a bout of profit-taking and pre-weekend position-squaring Friday, after rising to long-time highs, brokers said. 
However, world and domestic crop concerns, the strength of the dollar and general bullish sentiment will carry the markets to fresh highs short term, they said. 
On the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange, the benchmark November feed wheat contract ended just 25 pence up at GBP82/ton, after hitting a new two-year high of GBP83/ton in early trade. 
Meanwhile, Matif November rapeseed futures fell EUR2.75 on the day to EUR265/ton, after hitting a three-year high of EUR271/ton in early trade. 
The U.K. wheat crop and the French rapeseed crop are forecast to be well down on last year, and wheat and canola crops in some other major producing countries are also expected to fall. 
Meanwhile, the strength of the dollar is allowing European grain and oilseed traders to up prices and still remain competitive against U.S. imports and dollar-denominated grains on the world market.

LME Base Metals: Copper Pressured Down By Stock Build

07/13/2001
Dow Jones Commodities Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- London Metal Exchange three-month copper ended Friday's late kerb lower compared with Thursday, pressured by another stock build, dealers said. 
(LME three-month metals prices in dollars a metric ton at 1600 GMT, with the previous late kerb close in parentheses. Comex copper at 1641 GMT in cents a pound, with the previous close in parentheses.) Copper 1,554.50 (1,560.50) Tin 4,452.50 (4,502.50) 
Aluminum 1,452.25 (1,458.50) Zinc 871.50 (877.50) 
Nickel 5,925.00 (6,012.50) Lead 462.50 (465.00) 
Comex Sep Copper 70.75 (70.80)
An increase of 7,475 tons of copper Friday brought total stocks up to a 12-month high of 550,300 tons. This pressured prices in early trade down to test $1,550/ton support before rising slightly to close at $1,554.50/ton, down from Thursday's close of $1,560.50/ton. 
Unconfirmed market talk said Enron is behind much of the week's stock rise, in an effort to ease nearby supply tightness and to alleviate the large short positions it is thought to have built up on the July-for-a-week spread, which is currently showing a $6-$8/ton backwardation. The July futures contract will switch over to cash Monday.

"Copper has been sensitive to moves in the stock market, but not this time," Norrish said. In fact, now it appears that base metals markets ignore equities markets when they rally, but follow stocks down when they slump, he added. 
Aluminum also ended the late kerb lower Friday. 
News of the restart of some smelters has dampened sentiment, despite a stock drawdown of around 8,000 tons since the end of last week, dealers said. 
"The stock drawdowns are fairly small percentage-wise," said Standard Bank analyst Robin Bhar, adding that they would need to be much larger to significantly improve market sentiment. 
"A test of $1,435/ton cannot be ruled out, though we would expect forward buying to prevent a break below this level for the time being," Barclays said in a market report. 
Zinc continued its slump, falling to a seven-and-a-half-year low, mainly on technicals. 
Technicals also hurt nickel, which rose slightly after breaking $5,900/ton support but still closed at its lowest level since April. 
Nickel's fall was "just on some speculative liquidation and short selling, mostly chart-based," Bhar said.

UK: Telecoms, drugs drive FTSE 100 rally, Vodafone leads.
By Camila Reed

07/13/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, July 13 (Reuters) - Britain's largest companies raced higher at the close on Friday fired by telecoms and drug stocks as they bounced back from Wednesday's 16-week low. 
Index heavyweights Vodafone and GlaxoSmithKline provided 27 of the day's 55-point gain, while technology firms wobbled. However, the telecoms giant surged 4.1 percent to 157-1/4p.
The FTSE 100 finished 55.4 points or one percent firmer at 5,537.0, having jumped 1.66 percent on Thursday after seven consecutive losing sessions, with gainers outnumbering losers by three to one. 
Stocks steamed higher and refused to be derailed by sluggish U.S. retail sales figures for June, which showed only a meagre rise, and a weaker Wall Street, but volumes were thin at 1.4 billion shares. 
By London's 1530 GMT finish the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average was down five points, while the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index was flat, having streaked up in the previous session. 
Mike Lenhoff and Simon Rubinsohn at money managers Gerrard said that the UK equity market was deeply oversold and long-term this presented a buying opportunity for UK equities. 
DRUGS SEE-SAW 
Drugs reversed an earlier decline with Nycomed Amersham among the day's top performers, up nearly four percent at 536-1/2p and AstraZeneca rising over one percent. 
Mining giant Anglo American moved into the FTSE 100 top ten gainers with a three percent rise, as investors sought refuge in mining stocks as a cyclical play. 
Another major gainer was British business services firm Hays Plc up 3.4 percent. The shares leapt on market talk that Germany's Deutsche Post was looking to make a bid for it, dealers said. 
Both Deutsche Post and Hays declined to comment. 
Firmer crude prices gave support to the oil sector. BP rose 0.6 percent to 572 pence and Shell also added 0.6 percent to 581-1/2p lifting the index by four points. 
FTSE MIXED PICTURE 
But dealers and analysts said it would be a mixed picture going forward with the market scrutinising data for signs of a sustained economic recovery or a lapse in consumer confidence. 
"This week we had a really bloody day on Wednesday and then the opposite on Thursday, so we're going to be on a rollercoaster still. It's very fragile but it does show the potential of the market," said Foreign & Colonial director of UK equities David Manning. 
"It's not only the holiday period, it's also that the market can make you look an idiot one day to the next. In that sort of circumstance the temptation is to do very little," he said. 
ABN Amro strategist Gareth Williams said the market would make modest progress over the next month or so, with moves downward quite likely although the trend would be upwards over the course of the year. 
TECHS DIP 
Thursday's 5.3-percent rally in the Nasdaq failed to bring any cheer to UK technology shares. Logica and Colt Telecom slid four percent, while microchip designer ARM fell 3.9 percent to 223 pence trimming Thursday's 13 percent jump. 
The techMARK index of technology shares rose 0.98 percent to 1,602.87. 
Elsewhere on the downside, UK holiday operator Airtours lost nearly 10 percent of its value after Swiss peer Kuoni issued a profit warning. 
Among second liners, Baltimore Technologies closed up 3.3 percent. It initially rallied 22 percent after the Irish Internet security firm said it received an approach from an unlisted British-based company for an all-paper deal to combine the companies. 
The FTSE 250 Mid-cap index finished 5.1 points stronger at 6,163.8. 
Among small-caps, Paladin Resources' shares jumped 10 percent after the UK oil explorer said that major shareholder U.S. oil giant Enron had sold the whole of its 40-million-share stake via HSBC bank for 44 pence a share. 
Britain's Litho Supplies Plc slumped 42.5 percent after the company, which supplies printing and graphic arts products, said that sales in the first six months of 2001 were on target, but profits would likely be below expectations due to tough market conditions and pressure on margins.

Futures Contract Covering Coal Debuts in New York (Correct)

Futures Contract Covering Coal Debuts in New York (Correct)

     (Corrects location of FirstEnergy Corp. in 10th paragraph of
story that moved yesterday.)

     New York, July 12 (Bloomberg) -- The New York Mercantile
Exchange today began trading a futures contract for low-sulfur
coal, a fuel that President George W. Bush said will play a major
role in meeting electricity demand over the next two decades.
     The contract's debut came after prices for coal, considered
the dirtiest of power-plant fuels, doubled in the past year, as
demand from power plants outstripped mine production. Coal for
September delivery opened at $42 a ton and settled at $40.75, as
98 contracts were traded, exchange officials said.
     ``We had a big run-up in coal prices this past winter,'' said
Andy Ozley, who buys coal for Atlanta-based Mirant Corp.'s six
coal plants in New York, Illinois, Maryland and Virginia. ``This
contract affords us a way to mitigate our exposure'' to large
price swings.
     The Bush administration said in an energy policy report this
spring that coal would be the dominant fuel for electricity
generation through 2020. Bush gave an added boost to the fuel when
he retreated from a campaign pledge to restrict carbon dioxide
emissions, implicated in global warming.
     Coal plants are responsible for a third of the nation's
carbon dioxide emissions. They also produce sulfur dioxide, which
causes acid rain, and nitrogen oxides, which cause smog.
     The Nymex started the futures contract to give mining
companies and utilities a way to hedge their risks in the $33
billion coal market. Producers such as Peabody Energy Corp. and
Arch Coal Inc., whose shares have soared in the past year, have
said they would trade the futures.

                            New Plants

     Last year's quadrupling of prices for natural gas -- a
cleaner-burning power-plant fuel -- prompted many generators to
ramp up output from their coal plants. Utility coal stockpiles
dwindled, and prices have risen to their highest levels since at
least 1989.
     So far this year, more than a dozen companies have announced
plans to build coal-fired plants, including Kansas City, Missouri-
based Kansas City Power & Light Co. and Portland, Oregon-based
PacifiCorp.
     Although coal is used to produce 52 percent of the nation's
electricity, few plants were built during the 1990s because of the
high costs of building them and the difficulty of complying with
federal and local environmental regulations.
     Demand for coal has eased in recent weeks as below-normal
temperatures in the U.S. Midwest and Northeast reduced demand for
air conditioning, said Jim Parks, who buys coal for six power
plants in Ohio and Pennsylvania as director of fuels at Akron,
Ohio-based FirstEnergy Corp.
     ``The summer's been pretty mild so far -- you haven't seen
any big heat waves'' in regions with the most coal generation, he
said.

                           Big Sandy

     The Nymex futures contract calls for the delivery of 1,550
tons of low-sulfur coal to the mouth of the Big Sandy River near
Huntington, West Virginia. From there, the fuel would be loaded
onto Ohio River barges and shipped to power plants in the U.S. and
possibly Europe.
     The new contract is tailored to producers in Appalachian
states that account for about 40 percent of U.S. production,
including West Virginia, Kentucky and Pennsylvania, the No. 2, 3
and 4 coal producers.
     The industry lacks a futures contract for coal from Western
states that account for 47 percent of the nation's production,
including the No. 1 producer, Wyoming.

                         Avoiding the Past

     The exchange, which earns commissions on trades, hopes coal
futures will avoid the fate of other contracts it has started over
the past few years. Its six electricity futures contracts have
fizzled, as has its Middle East sour crude oil contract, which
debuted in May 2000.
     ``I said yesterday, if you traded 100 to 200 contracts, that
would be a really a good day,'' said Chris Casale, vice president
of energy trading at Dynegy Inc. in Houston, which trades coal and
buys the fuel for its six power plants in New York and Illinois.
``It came out sort of on target.''
     Most of today's trading was originated by large energy
marketing companies, he said, although he declined to say whether
Dynegy traded any contracts. Enron Corp., the largest energy
trader, and Duke Energy Corp., the largest U.S.-based utility
holding company, have said they would trade coal futures.
     Exchange officials have said the coal market has the
potential to reach 5,000 trades a day after a year of trading.
     The Nymex's 17-year-old crude oil futures contract averages
about 66,700 trades a day, and its 11-year-old natural gas
contract averages about 33,500.

                           Wary of Coal

     ``The coal market is still lacking liquidity,'' said Anthony
McAuley, a floor broker at ABN Amro Inc., who said he bought five
coal contracts for a client at $42 a ton -- the market's first
transaction. ``You probably need to see a little more
participation'' from industry coal buyers and sellers for the
market to take off.
     Independent floor traders, known as locals, are wary of
trading coal futures without assurances that the industry will be
active as well.
     ``Floor traders lost millions'' in electricity futures when
some were caught with high-priced contracts and nobody in the
industry to sell them to, he said.
     ``Because of that, people are a little bit tentative about
coal,'' said Tom Schiff, an independent crude oil trader. ``We're
here to help make liquidity but we can't tackle all the risk.''







			
			
		 Modern Metals, July 2001    Giant energy concern now turns its attention to steel. The company's aggressive posture has begged controversy. Industry reactions vary from hand-wringing to open arms. Still others characterize Enron as a "non-event." By Michelle Martinez Arjona, Editor-in-Chief, and Paul Hohl, Contributing Editor  These days, saying the word "Enron" in a room full of metals executives is like screaming "fire" in a crowded theater. For most in the steel industry, the idea of a futures market is enough to raise a few eyebrows. But when a major market maker with annual revenues of 10 times the market cap of the U.S. steelmaking industry stakes a claim (for 2000 alone, Enron logged revenues of $101 billion--that's with a "b"), a lot more than eyebrows are likely to be raised. After a bold presentation from Jeff McMahon, president and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets, at the SSCI annual convention in May (in which he accused steel mills of treating their service center customers as "annoyances"), industry leaders rushed to understand this latest market contender.  Friend or foe? Competitor or partner? These are just a couple of the questions surrounding Enron's aggressive push into the metals industry. Judging from the service center and mill executives Modern Metals queried, there are as many answers as there are opinions in the industry. Reactions ranged from fear to acceptance to downright resentment. At least one mill was reticent to discuss Enron at all--still others seemed to meet the issue with unaffected shrugs. If the saying is true that all publicity is good publicity, the buzz that Enron has generated would make even a Hollywood spin doctor envious. What's the hubbub? Although products such as natural gas and energy--Enron's major business platform--have been traded as commodities for years, until Enron's appearance a formal forward market for steel has never existed. According to McMahon, the absence of a liquid and transparent market has resulted in "uninformed investment decisions" that have exacerbated the current oversupply situation, and left companies exposed to the hazards of price volatility.  Enron's answer is to offer a variety of financial hedging products along with forward contracts in hot-rolled, cold-rolled and galvanized (plate and long products are soon to follow), locking in prices for as many as five years out. Enron contends that it can act as a "risk intermediary" in steel transactions, ensuring healthier profit margins and lowering the cost of capital. Certain grades of steel are commodities, McMahon insists, and as such should be bought and sold on a commodity market basis, instead of the strategic relationships that now exist between the mills and consumers. Enron has been offering steel online, and via phone and fax, since November of last year. "Before you add capacity, before you make an investment decision, you'll be able to see a three, five, maybe even a 10-year forward price of steel," McMahon stated, "and if you want to hedge that investment you can do that." The company plans to buy steel at a floating price and then sell it to steel consumers at a fixed rate, making money on the spread. In February, Greg Hermans, VP of steel trading at Enron, reported to AMM that it was offering U.S.-made 10-gauge, 48-in. wide hot-rolled for April delivery in Chicago for $225 a ton. Hermans said Enron was buying the same product for April delivery at $215 a ton.  Eventually, Enron sees the development of four different marketplaces: the Northeast, the Midwest (or Chicago area), the Gulf Coast (or Houston area), and the West Coast. Enron will hedge against spot price spikes through equity and physical holdings in domestic mills. The company closed on Huntco's Arkansas-based cold-rolling mill in June. "It's a big portfolio," McMahon said. "We wanted to put together a portfolio of supply and demand. In some cases, we'll own assets--hopefully we'll own some term contracts with domestic mills. To the extent that imports are a part of the equation, we'll be a part of that market. We may purchase capacity from somebody, not necessarily the assets, but toll slab through a hot strip mill. All of those combined is how we do our business." Steel mills can benefit, McMahon said, by entering into a multi-year "physical off take" with Enron, thus giving steel mills a degree of certain volume and on product specification. Enron would guarantee purchase of a specified amount of tonnage, and use a floating price or a floor price to guard against market shocks. Whether mills would be willing to divert capacity to the commodity grades being bought and sold by Enron remains uncertain. At least one mill executive privately said no . . . at least for now. Nucor president, CEO and vice chairman, Dan DiMicco also sees little value in Enron's proposal. "What we need to have is stable pricing at levels where the most efficient mills can make a good return on their capital and further invest in new technologies and equipment," he stated. "I define true value as helping the industry to become stronger. It doesn't do any good to maintain a lack of price volatility at $200 a ton." Keith Busse, CEO at Steel Dynamics, echoed that sentiment in a recent New Steel article. "If you're trying to get volatility out at $320 [per ton], great," he said. "But at $230, you want to stick your fingers down your throat." For the service centers Service centers, McMahon suggested, could benefit immediately. "The only way [distributors] are able to hedge themselves is to go out and buy inventory," he explained. "That takes capital, and cash, and space. We can offer a financial product that gives the exact same protection, but doesn't require any of the above. "We can hold those inventories and price the steel at the time of delivery to the service centers," he continued, "so their 4- or 5- percent net margins are somewhat certain." "I do think that Enron is providing a service for the industry . . . " commented Dave Lerman, CEO of Steel Warehouse, South Bend, Indiana. But he pointed out that "how [it] moves forward will be interesting. If they just move forward with hedge instruments . . . that's independent of whether you run your business well by having a good supplier that matches up with the demands of your customers. I think [Enron] will be a good thing for some people and a non-event for others." Beyond hedging, McMahon pointed out, firm and enforceable contracts could become a key benefit to service centers. As one Midwestern distributor source commented, "One of the terrible things that happens in our business is that end users demand long-term pricing, beyond what anybody can foresee. When they anticipate the market is going up, or that it has hit a low point, they push harder for it--as any one would. But historically, they don't honor the deals."  In a down market, he explained, customers demand lower prices. Noncompliance can result in orders, but no releases, and a "don't call us, we'll call you" attitude from customers. The consequence for service centers, he said, are price reductions on the way down and on the way up. "If Enron brings integrity to both sides of this market," he concluded, "that would be a very big plus for the steel industry." But integrity, another Midwest service center exec countered, has got nothing to do with it. In his estimation, Enron is like a profiteering carpetbagger, "trying to make a buck in between the producer and the user. That's all we need right now," he declared, "somebody trying to squeeze out a few more dollars." But, he recognized, "we're all going to have to deal with it." Don McNeeley, president and CEO of Chicago Tube & Iron, indicated that some good could come of a heavy-hitter like Enron introducing new ideas into the industry, but acknowledged that people might be offended by somebody picking the so-called "low-hanging fruit" of the steel market in the current economy. "What do you think the mills are going to do when you come to them for just the peripheral items?" he queried. "My concern would be that the price would go up on [those items]." McNeeley also questioned the wisdom of distributors relinquishing control of their inventories. "In distribution, 60 percent of our net worth is inventory, 30 percent is accounts receivable, and 10 percent is plant property and equipment," he related. "Our single largest asset is our inventory. If a distribution company surrenders control of its inventory to a third party, does not that distributor, in effect, surrender its own sovereignty?" Only just begun Questions abound regarding Enron's role as a physical supplier of steel as well. As one Minnesota-based service center exec put it, "are they ready to deal with problems?" Although Enron has expressed interest in being a physical supplier, Dave Lerman explained, "I think that's going to be a lot more difficult to implement." Enron would have to consider specific qualities, coil sizes, nuances of chemistry, surface quality, and formability. "Most customers require better than standard tolerances," he pointed out. "These are all issues that might complicate commodity sales." Delivery is another issue. As a physical supplier, Enron has virtually guaranteed just-in-time delivery, but as one service center source said, "the guarantee is good when the material shows up at my door. What happens if it doesn't show up? I disappoint a customer. What good does it do to sue [Enron] if I've lost a customer?" Mill executives have questioned whether Enron is a potential competitor. "They see Enron as someone likely to buy foreign steel in order to deliver it to a U.S. customer," said Chuck Bradford, principal of Bradford Research and a long-time industry observer. He cautioned against seeing Enron as too much of a physical supplier, speculating that the future of Enron, similar to the LME, will be in hedging. "You may see some [physical transactions] to start with," Bradford predicted, "just to get the ball rolling. But I don't see that as the way the market will develop." McMahon has been consistent in saying that Enron has little interest in becoming a steel manufacturer. The real value, he said, is in a transparent, liquid market. "We know the products work, we know the market wants them. Can any one particular mill or mills prevent that? We don't think so," he said. "It's not an 'if', it's a 'when'." The jury is still out on just how soon that "when" will come, and what those effects will be for the steel industry. And for all of the debate surrounding the issue, it seems a bit soon to be hitting the panic button. As Don McNeeley recounted, "I can recall similar controversy over a speech a guy gave about 15-17 years ago. That guy's name was Ken Iverson, and he had this concept called a mini-mill. Look at it now."

Questioning the Books: Enron Official Failed to Warn Participants Of 401(k) Plan

WASHINGTON -- A top Enron Corp. human-resources executive who also served as a trustee of the company's 401(k) plan said she became aware of serious allegations about the company's financial practices in August, but did nothing to protect retirement-plan members. 
Speaking at a Senate government affairs committee hearing, Cindy Olson said Enron Vice President Sherron Watkins approached her for advice before sending her now well-publicized e-mail to former Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay in August voicing concerns about the company's accounting practices. Ms. Olson said Ms. Watkins also sought out Jeffrey McMahon, currently Enron's chief operating officer, who was then its treasurer, for guidance at the time.
Enron's retirement plans, decimated by the collapse of the Houston energy concern, will come under further scrutiny in Congress this week. Today, Labor Secretary Elaine Chao testifies before the House Education and Workforce Committee about whether retirement-plan rules should change in the wake of Enron's collapse; tomorrow the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions will hear from former Enron workers. 
In yesterday's hearing, Ms. Olson said she didn't share Ms. Watkins's allegations with the other 401(k) plan trustees because she didn't feel it was her responsibility to repeat "hearsay." In addition, she said, Ms. Watkins had come to her in confidence. After Ms. Watkins took her concerns to Mr. Lay and he ordered an investigation, "I felt it was all in good hands," Ms. Olson said. 
Eli Gottesdiener, a Washington-based lawyer representing Enron workers, countered those arguments. "She had information that affected the lives of 10,000 people and did nothing," he said, adding, "It's so clear that she breached her duty." He said Ms. Olson should have convened an emergency meeting of the trustees to inform them of Ms. Watkins's allegations so that they could launch their own investigation. The trustees immediately could have stopped offering Enron stock as an investment option, and stopped using Enron stock as a matching contribution in the retirement plan. 
Ms. Olson testified that the plan trustees felt that they didn't have the ability to change the plan design without approval from the board of directors. 
Ms. Olson herself sold much of her own Enron holdings, most before she knew of Ms. Watkins's concerns, but some afterward. Responding to sharp questioning from lawmakers, including Sen. Joseph Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat who heads the Senate's Government Affairs Committee, Ms. Olson acknowledged she sold 83,000 Enron shares for $6.5 million, the bulk from December 2000 to March 2001. She said she decided to sell the shares after having a falling out with former Enron President Jeffrey Skilling over their different management styles. Thinking about leaving the company, she said, she went to a financial adviser who advised her to diversify her portfolio; at his suggestion, she said, she put the proceeds from selling her Enron shares into government bonds. 
A few days before Enron filed for bankruptcy-court protection on Dec. 2, Ms. Olson said she sold an additional 3,000 Enron shares that were in her employee stock ownership plan, for $2 each. She said she didn't have knowledge of the bankruptcy, but suspected the possibility. 
During the hearing, Mr. Lieberman said he would issue subpoenas to gather more information about the alleged payment of $105 million in bonuses to management around the time Enron filed for Chapter 11, and the company's alleged failure to pay workers severance pay, beyond a one-time $4,500 payment. 
As Enron shares plunged last fall, the company also considered postponing a planned "blackout" during which time employees wouldn't be able to change their investments or sell Enron stock, said Ms. Olson and Enron benefits manager Mikie Rath. Ms. Olson said she finally decided against a delay after consulting with other Enron executives and an outside lawyer several days before the scheduled blackout that began on Oct. 26 last year and lasted for about 10 trading days. She said the lawyer had advised Enron to go ahead with the blackout, on the grounds that it wouldn't be able to notify in time all employees -- specifically about 11,000 retirees and other workers based outside of the Houston headquarters -- about a potential postponement. 
Executives from Northern Trust Retirement Consulting LLC and Hewitt Associates LLC, the companies that managed Enron's 401(k) plans, confirmed that they were contacted about the possibility of delaying the blackout period. 
Ms. Olson said Enron hired counsel in early November to seek legal advice on whether it "made sense" to advise employees on selling their Enron stockholdings. 
This week's hearings are intended to generate more information for lawmakers who will decide whether retirement plans ought to be more carefully regulated. House Energy and Commerce Chairman W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R., La.) says a top priority this year will be legislation aimed at protecting workers such as those at Enron. "Clearly, we need pension reform," Mr. Tauzin, the leading congressional investigator into Enron, said in an interview. 
However, retirement-plan experts say any significant change will be an uphill battle, as employer groups, Republicans, and the Bush administration oppose an overhaul -- in particular, any limits on company stock in retirement plans. 
Somewhat less controversial are proposals, by Democrats and more recently by President Bush and Rob Portman (R., Ohio) and Ben Cardin (D., Md.), that would provide employees greater ability to diversify out of stock contributed by their employer. Many employers now lock workers into such shares until age 50 or later. 
On this issue, there may be more opportunity for compromise, since so far, all proposals still leave employers with the freedom to lock employees into company stock for long periods. Mr. Bush's proposal has the weakest diversification provisions, as it exempts many defined contribution savings plans from proposed diversification rules, particularly ESOPs, which hundreds of large employers use. Consequently, employers could continue to lock workers into company stock in many plans until age 55 and later.

ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: THE OVERVIEW
ENRON EXECUTIVES SAY THEY DEBATED FREEZE ON PENSION
By STEVEN GREENHOUSE and STEPHEN LABATON

WASHINGTON, Feb. 5 -- Enron executives acknowledged today that before they temporarily prevented employees from selling company stock in their retirement accounts last fall, the executives had sharply debated delaying the moratorium because employees could suffer heavy losses from a plunging stock price. 
''We were concerned in the benefits department about the deterioration of the stock price,'' Mikie Rath, a benefits manager at Enron, said in testimony before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee. But after the debate on the eve of the moratorium, they imposed the so-called blackout period to give themselves time to replace the administrators of the retirement plan.
Enron executives said they decided it would be too hard to notify the participants in the company's 401(k) plan immediately. They also said they feared they would open themselves to lawsuits by plan participants who were notified about the delay later than others for reasons like mail delays. 
The disclosures on the pension plan came as other Congressional committees took up Enron matters. 
House and Senate lawmakers issued subpoenas to compel the testimony of Enron's former chief executive, Kenneth L. Lay, while Congressional and state officials broadened their investigations into why state pension funds and state agencies invested and did business with Enron as it spiraled downward last year. 
The Senate Commerce Committee voted unanimously to issue the subpoena to require Mr. Lay's appearance next Tuesday. A similar subpoena was issued by Representative Michael G. Oxley, the Ohio Republican who is chairman of the House Financial Services Committee. 
A spokeswoman for Mr. Lay, who had been scheduled to testify on Monday but bowed out, said his lawyers would work out details for his appearance, although lawmakers said they expected that he would invoke his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. 
While Mr. Lay may not answer any questions, members of a House subcommittee on oversight and investigation focused on him today, trying to glean, by proxy, what he might say. 
Under questioning, William C. Powers, chairman of the special investigative committee of Enron's board that wrote a harshly critical report, said that in his four-hour interview with Mr. Lay, the former chairman understood that off-the-books partnerships were set up to hide losses. ''But,'' Mr. Powers said, ''he didn't understand or appreciate that there was anything wrong with that. That's his story. The accountants signed off, and he was O.K. with that.'' 
President Bush brushed aside a demand by Senator Ernest F. Hollings, the South Carolina Democrat who heads the Commerce Committee, that a special counsel should be appointed to supervise the criminal investigation of Enron. Mr. Hollings cited Enron's ties to administration officials, including the attorney general. 
Mr. Bush told reporters as he toured a research laboratory in Pittsburgh: ''This is a business problem, and my Justice Department is going to investigate. If there's wrongdoing, we'll hold them accountable for mistreatment of employees and shareholders.'' 
Lawyers representing the employees have accused Enron of stock fraud for imposing the moratorium and for not disclosing the company's financial condition, resulting, the lawyers say, in losses of more than $1.2 billion for the 15,000 participants in Enron's retirement plan. During the moratorium, employees could not sell stock in the retirement plan, but senior executives faced no restrictions in selling their stock. 
The testimony prompted a new round of criticism of Enron's senior officials for looking out for their own interests while turning their backs on their employees. 
''Management knew full well that their employees' 401(k)'s were overloaded with shares of Enron,'' said Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, the Connecticut Democrat who is chairman of the governmental affairs committee. ''Shouldn't that have prompted them to postpone the lockdown when the company was reeling?'' 
In response to the collapse of Enron, an administration task force is preparing recommendations to revise securities and corporate laws. Administration officials said that they were debating proposals to make it more likely that corporate executives and boards face personal liability for violating the law. 
Officials in Connecticut, one of several states considering whether to suspend or revoke the license of Arthur Andersen, Enron's accounting firm, said they had subpoenaed Andersen records. 
Richard Blumenthal, the attorney general in Connecticut, said he was examining a state agency's decision last year to pay Enron $220 million for an energy contract that might never be fulfilled. 
At a House committee hearing, Joseph F. Berardino, Andersen's chief executive, repeated earlier statements that important information about Enron's finances had been withheld from his firm. 
Democrats and Republicans repeatedly complained that Mr. Berardino was evading the committee's questions about Andersen's involvement in Enron's collapse. 
''Maybe it's better to be dumb than culpable, but we want some answers,'' said Representative Gary L. Ackerman, Democrat of New York. ''Your not knowing what was going on, if that's the case, is basically saying that you have squandered the integrity of your company.'' 
Mr. Berardino said Andersen would establish new offices of audit quality and ethics and compliance. 
Before approving the subpoena of Mr. Lay, members of the Senate Commerce Committee said that they had begun investigating losses that state pension funds sustained from the decline in Enron stock. 
Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida, said it was suspicious that an investment manager for the Florida retirement system bought millions of dollars in shares last fall, at prices ranging from $22.82 to $9.02, even after Enron had announced that it was being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
A few days before Enron filed for bankruptcy, the fund sold more than seven million shares at 28 cents each. 
The investment management firm that bought the Enron stock for Florida's retirement funds is Alliance Capital. Frank Savage, a recently retired senior executive at Alliance, sits on Enron's board. 
Mr. Nelson said that if Mr. Lay had agreed to testify, he would be asked, ''Were they told to buy the stock to prop it up?'' 
John Meyers, a spokesman at Alliance Capital, said that the investments were reasonable at the time and that Mr. Savage ''had no involvement in the buying, holding or selling of Enron'' stock. 
At the Senate governmental affairs hearing, Cindy Olson, Enron's executive vice president for human resources, said there had been a debate on the day before the trading moratorium about whether the company should postpone the blackout, which was needed for a change in plan administrators. 
But executives said they decided against delaying after concluding that it would be too hard to notify the participants in Enron's 401(k) plan immediately. The executives said they feared that if they delayed this blackout period, they would open themselves to lawsuits by participants who were notified later than others for reasons like mail delays. 
Though the company says the blackout began Oct. 26, it sent out conflicting bulletins. The confusion led many employees to think that the blackout began Oct. 19, when Enron stock traded at $26.05. By the time employees were able to sell shares on Nov. 13, the shares had plunged, closing at $9.98 that day. 
Deborah G. Perrotta, a former senior administrative assistant, told the committee that the blackout hurt. ''A delay would have saved a lot of people,'' she said. 
Several senators said it was unconscionable for Mr. Lay and other Enron officials to tell employees that the stock price would continue to rise while some officials were raising tough questions about the stability of the company's finances. 
Ms. Olson, who served as a trustee of Enron's retirement plan, testified that in August, Sherron S. Watkins, an Enron vice president, had told her of concerns she had about whether Enron executives had engaged in some chicanery that undermined the company's finances. Ms. Watkins raised many of those questions in a letter last summer to Mr. Lay. 
Saying she was not convinced that Ms. Watkins's assertions were accurate, Ms. Olson said that she, as a plan fiduciary, did not deem it necessary to inform plan participants of the questions about Enron.

Rich Employee, Poor Employee; Senate Panel Looking at Pensions Shown Both Sides of the Enron Coin

Two Enron employees told a Senate committee yesterday what happened to them before and immediately after the collapse of the giant Texas energy-trading company. 
Their stories were very different.
Deborah G. Perrotta, an administrative assistant, broke down in tears as she described losing her job, $40,000 in retirement savings and all but a fraction of her severance pay. 
The other, Cindy Olson, executive vice president of Enron's human resources department and one of the people in charge of the company's ill-fated 401(k) plan, still works for Enron. She matter-of-factly described how a year ago, when Enron stock was near its peak, she cashed in options on 83,000 shares, netting about $3 million. 
Their testimony again highlighted the devastation that can befall employees who tie their jobs and their retirement security to a single company. But it also showed how much difference professional advice and investment instincts can make for workers in a situation like Enron's, and how workers caught up in a company's collapse can be affected very differently. 
Perrotta and Olson testified before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, which is trying to determine what changes might be needed in federal pension and employment laws to improve worker protections should their employer fail. 
The hearing highlighted several issues that are common in 401(k) and other retirement savings plans known as defined-contribution plans, which, unlike old-fashioned defined-benefit pensions, place the market risk and reward on employees. 
* Fiduciary responsibility. Who is responsible for sharing information with employees and retirees, and how and when? 
Former Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay encouraged workers to keep their retirement money in company stock. Perrotta recalled that in August she was awarded a block of shares, and an accompanying e-mail from Lay said that "one of my highest priorities is to restore investor confidence in Enron. This should result in a significantly higher stock price. I hope this grant lets you know how valued you are to Enron." 
Olson, however, had a higher position at the company and access to more information than Perrotta. Indeed, Olson actually spoke with whistle-blower Sherron Watkins before Watkins sent her anonymous letter to Lay, in which she said she worried that the company's accounting practices could lead to a major scandal. Olson said Watkins was fearful that she was overlooking something or that there was some other reason her conclusions might be incorrect. Olson took no action to inform other employees about the concerns, however. "She went to speak to Mr. Lay, and Mr. Lay kicked off an investigation," Olson said. ". . . I felt like it was in good hands." 
* How tough it is to separate loyalty from investment decisions. 
Enron's restrictions on employees selling stock they received as matching contributions to their 401(k) plans have been well chronicled. But, by some accounts, 89 percent of the Enron stock in the plan was there because workers invested in it voluntarily. 
Olson, however, had been granted options that did not have the same restrictions against selling as the Enron stock matches in the 401(k) plan. Olson said she cashed in her options only because she had a run-in with then-chief executive Jeffrey Skilling that motivated her to seek professional investment advice. The adviser told her she was too emotionally involved with the stock, and she agreed to sell. 
Olson said she held on to another 3,000 shares in her retirement account until two days before the company went into bankruptcy. 
The panel is looking at proposals to limit the percentage of company stock permitted in a 401(k) account. But employer groups argue that retirement plans are often designed to align the interests of workers and companies, and they are urging Congress to be careful not to discourage companies from offering retirement plans or matching worker contributions to plans. 
* Investment advice. Most companies are reluctant to provide it for fear of exposing themselves to liability if the advice doesn't work out. 
Pending legislation would permit them to provide advice or to pay for it from third parties. 
The potential benefits for employees seem clear in retrospect. Olson went to an adviser while Perrotta did not. "When it started to fall apart, we just sat there -- watched it," Perrotta said. 
But critics say that the issue is more complex than it seems and that any legislation should be careful to eliminate conflicts of interest among advisers and employers. 
* "Lockdowns" of 401(k) plans. These freezes on account activity occur when a company changes plan administrators, and can last up to several months. Enron changed administrators last fall and employee accounts were frozen for several weeks. The exact duration is in dispute. 
* Severance in bankruptcy. Laid-off workers are generally limited to payments of about $4,500. Severance owed beyond that is usually treated as a general unsecured debt, though some courts have been more lenient. 
It has become routine, however, for companies entering bankruptcy to pay large "retention bonuses" to keep certain workers while the newly unemployed get little. Enron paid out $55 million in such bonuses. 
Enron benefits manager Mikie Rath, who testified with Olson, drew snickers in the crowded hearing room when she said she had gotten a retention bonus but could not remember exactly how much it was. Pressed, she said it was "about" $20,000. 
Enron workers who were laid off would have been entitled to about $150 million total, and Olson said "we thought we could give employees the full severance" but "at the 11th hour we found we could only give $4,500." Company lawyers said the limit was set by law, she said.

Execs say they tried to protect workers' money 
By PATTY REINERT 
Copyright 2002 Houston Chronicle Washington Bureau 
Feb. 5, 2002, 9:17PM
WASHINGTON -- Two Enron executives told a Senate panel Tuesday that they scrambled to protect employees' retirement savings and severance pay as soon as they realized the company was collapsing last year. 
"We did the best we could with a difficult situation," said Cindy Olson, executive vice president for human resources for the Houston energy trader. 
Olson and Enron benefits manager Mikie Rath told members of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee that they had considered, then rejected, putting off a planned change in the company's investment administrator last fall when they realized the transition would take place as Enron's stock was falling. Employees were prevented from selling the stock in their 401(k) retirement accounts during the transition. 
Later, as the company was headed for bankruptcy, Olson said she had several conversations with then-Chairman Ken Lay to try to salvage employees' severance pay. She quickly concluded, she said, that employees would get only a nominal payment of $4,500 each if Enron declared bankruptcy. The realization was devastating, she said. 
Several former Enron workers, who are suing Olson and other top executives, criticized the executives' testimony. 
Debbie Perrotta, a laid-off senior administrative assistant who had worked at Enron for five years, testified Tuesday that 4,500 Houston Enron employees lost their jobs, their retirement savings and an estimated $150 million in severance and vacation pay after the company filed for bankruptcy on Dec. 2. 
But two days before that filing, Perrotta said, "Enron cut $105 million in retention bonuses for a small number of executives." 
Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., who heads the Senate committee, said he would subpoena records on the retention bonuses. 
Perrotta broke down and cried several times as she told of losing $40,000 in retirement money and struggling to pay for her family's health care and her daughter's wedding. She said she and other laid-off employees now must wait in line behind Enron's creditors in bankruptcy court to recover whatever they can. 
"It may be the law," she said, "but it's wrong." 
Lieberman asked Olson to explain why she failed to warn employees to sell their Enron stock as the price was sliding. 
"We didn't have a crystal ball," Olson said. "We didn't know where the stock was going to go." 
She added that federal law limits what investment advice employers can give their employees. Besides, she said, the company's top executives put their faith in Lay and hoped he could save the company. 
But Lieberman pointed out that something must have motivated Olson to sell $6.5 million of her own Enron stock months earlier. 
Olson -- who served on Enron's executive committee from 1999 until she and then-Chief Executive Officer Jeff Skilling had a falling out and he removed her in early 2001 -- said she sold most of her company stock in late 2000 and early 2001. 
Olson said she was thinking of leaving Enron after Skilling demoted her from the executive committee and took away some of her human resources duties. She said she and Skilling "did not see eye to eye" about how employees should be treated. 
Olson said she and her husband hired their own financial adviser, who urged her to diversify her stock portfolio so she would not be so reliant on her company's stock. 
Olson also testified that Sherron Watkins, a former Enron executive, had come to her last summer, asking Olson's advice on whether she should approach Lay with concerns about accounting problems she believed threatened to bring down the company. 
Olson said Watkins was unsure whether a memo she had written to Lay on Aug. 15 was technically or legally accurate. Olson said she encouraged Watkins to talk to Lay. 
Even after her conversation with Watkins, however, Olson said she did not warn her colleagues. Her talk with Watkins had been confidential, she said, and she trusted Lay to act if Watkins' fears were on target. 
Both Olson and Rath told lawmakers that they had considered halting the transition to a new retirement fund administrator last fall, but concluded that it would take longer to stop the process than to go through with it. 
In the midst of last fall's anthrax scares and the resulting delays in mail service, they said, it would have been impossible to notify the 11,000 retirees invested in Enron's retirement plan if the company had decided to change the schedule for the transition. Notifying current Enron employees via e-mail would have treated current and former Enron employees differently and that would have been unfair, they said. 
Instead, they decided to speed up the transition process and were able to shave one week off of the lockdown period so that employees would have access to their accounts sooner, they said. 
At the time, Rath testified, she was still hoping the stock price would go back up. 
In the hallway outside the hearing later, several laid-off workers criticized the two executives' testimony. 
"She cashed out six and a half million dollars in her own Enron stock," Gwen Gray said of Olson. "She knew (the company was failing)." 
Gray, who also worked in Enron's human resources department before she was laid off, said she was disturbed by Rath's remark that she couldn't remember the amount of her own retention bonus. 
When Rath's former colleagues in the audience laughed at her statement, senators pressured Rath. She said the bonus was "in excess of $20,000." (Olson testified that she had received nothing to stay with the company.)

Enron CEO Felt 'Betrayed,' Panel Told; Head of Internal Probe Testifies on the Hill

Former Enron Corp. chairman Kenneth L. Lay told investigators for the Enron board that he should have paid more attention to his company's bookkeeping but felt "betrayed" by others at the company who kept information from him, the board's lead investigator testified yesterday. 
Lay, in four hours of interviews with the special board committee investigating the company's collapse, indicated that he knew the company was using Enron stock to protect investors in its off-the-books partnerships, said William C. Powers Jr., chairman of the committee, which issued its report Saturday.
That unusual strategy helped Enron hide large debts and losses. 
"When we interviewed Mr. Lay . . . he didn't understand or appreciate there was anything wrong with it," Powers, dean of the University of Texas Law School, told the House Government Reform subcommittee on oversight and investigations. Lay's story was that "the accountants had signed off on it," Powers said. "It was a credible device." 
Powers also disclosed that the Enron board's investigative committee spent "a couple of hours" interviewing former Enron vice chairman J. Clifford Baxter, who was found dead on Jan. 25 of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Powers said Baxter gave no hint that he was "a person . . . in danger." 
House members asked Powers for notes or recordings from that interview. Powers said he could not turn the records over without permission from the company, but he said he would support their release. Enron attorney Robert Bennett later said the company "certainly will provide the materials requested." 
Committees in the Senate and House yesterday subpoenaed Lay to appear on Capitol Hill on Feb. 12 and 14. Lay, who withdrew from a scheduled appearance Monday, is expected to invoke his constitutional right against self-incrimination and refuse to testify, but the subpoenas mean he will have to do so in person in the full glare of publicity. 
Meanwhile, members of a Financial Services subcommittee unleashed their wrath on Arthur Andersen chief executive Joseph F. Berardino, blasting the big accounting firm's audits of Enron and voicing exasperation when Berardino said he didn't know the answers to many of their questions about Andersen's conduct. 
"Maybe it's better to be dumb than culpable, but we want some answers," said Rep. Gary L. Ackerman (D-N.Y.). 
"I mean, your ship is going to go down and you're going to be lashed to the mast unless you start talking to us about what happened." 
Berardino, who headed Andersen's audit practice before becoming its chief executive about a year ago, said Andersen was still trying to gather the facts. 
"I don't know, with authority, what we knew and when we knew it," he told the Financial Services subcommittee on capital markets, one of several congressional panels investigating Enron's collapse. 
Separately, a spokesman for Andersen said yesterday that its auditors went to Enron's board earlier than was previously known with concerns about possible illegal activity. 
The first approach was in August, after the emergence of a letter from executive Sherron Watkins to Lay warning of widespread accounting irregularities, spokesman Charlie Leonard said. 
Federal law requires auditors to alert the SEC when they suspect illegality and the board or management does not address it. In this case, Andersen personnel went to the board but not to the SEC because they were assured the board was investigating the matter, Leonard said. 
Andersen previously said it had alerted the board to possible illegal activities last fall as Enron unraveled. 
As lawmakers search for ways to prevent future Enrons, Rep. Richard H. Baker (R-La.), chairman of the House subcommittee, floated what would be a fundamental change in the auditing business -- having stock exchanges hire the auditors. Currently, auditors are hired by the companies they are responsible for auditing -- an arrangement that some lawmakers say deters them from challenging dubious corporate accounting. 
In other developments yesterday, President Bush rejected a call by Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.) for a special prosecutor to investigate Enron, saying his Justice Department could do the job. Enron was a major contributor to the Bush presidential campaign and has ties to a number of administration officials. 
The House Energy and Commerce Committee yesterday subpoenaed former Enron chief financial officer Andrew S. Fastow to appear at a hearing tomorrow. Fastow's attorneys originally told the committee he would appear voluntarily, but they later informed the committee he had "a change of heart," committee spokesman Ken Johnson said. Fastow, who organized some of Enron's largest partnerships and earned at least $30 million from running them, intends to assert his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, Johnson said, but he will be required to do that in front of the committee. 
Fastow has hired criminal lawyer John Keker of San Francisco, who prosecuted Oliver L. North in the Iran-contra affair, to represent him in the Justice Department's criminal investigation. 
Andersen's chief executive yesterday made his second voluntary appearance before the capital markets subcommittee, and lawmakers praised him for testifying. But that was one of the few things they gave him credit for during about four hours of stern questioning and speechifying. It was a much more skeptical reception than Berardino received from the same lawmakers in December, when he faced few if any probing questions. That appearance, however, took place before Andersen acknowledged that it had destroyed numerous documents pertaining to its work at Enron, and before the Powers report said it "did not fulfill its professional responsibilities" in its Enron work. 
Berardino said auditing is "a hard job" and Andersen personnel "are trained to do the right thing." 
"But we are human beings, and we may not get it right every time. I'm not apologizing for that," he said. 
Rep. Max Sandlin (D-Tex.) asked Berardino to consider "the people whose lives . . . you helped destroy," a reference to Enron employees who lost their jobs and the bulk of their retirement savings when Enron collapsed. Rep. Michael E. Capuano (D-Mass.) said Andersen "blew it so badly." 
The report commissioned by Enron directors accused Andersen of failing in its responsibilities and helping Enron create a web of transactions designed to hide debts and losses. In the process, the report said, Andersen accountants "had to surmount numerous obstacles presented by pertinent accounting rules." 
For example, the report said Andersen advised Enron each step of the way about transactions with a group of off-the-books partnerships known as the Raptors, which "had little economic substance." 
The Raptor transactions accounted for about $1.1 billion of the $1.5 billion of pretax income Enron reported during the five quarters that preceded Enron's December bankruptcy filing. 
Berardino said Andersen approved deals involving the partnerships but didn't come up with the ideas for them. The accounting firm was reacting to plans developed by Enron personnel, investment bankers and others, he said. 
"Suffice it to say that we were very much involved, as the company was, setting up these transactions, giving our advice on whether they would pass the rules," Berardino said. That was part of Andersen's job as auditor, he said. 
"The point I would like to emphasize is, at the end of the day, these are the company's financial statements," Berardino told the committee. "We cannot make a company report any more than what the rules require," he said. 
Berardino called for a major overhaul of accounting and auditing, saying that simply tinkering with the system would fail to prevent further financial debacles. He said stronger discipline is needed because today "punishment is not sufficiently certain to promote confidence in the profession." 
The Andersen chief said auditors should rate the quality of a company's accounting instead of just issuing a pass or fail grade, as they now do. He told lawmakers that Andersen will no longer serve as both internal and outside auditor for the same company -- as it did at Enron -- and will stop consulting to audit clients on the design and implementation of their financial information systems. 
Berardino said such activities accounted for "very, very little" of the $52 million Andersen received from Enron in 2000. 
Some lawmakers called on Berardino to stop consulting to audit clients altogether. 
Meanwhile, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, the global parent of accounting firm Deloitte & Touche, said it will announce today that it intends to split off its $3.5 billion management-consulting business, following a similar announcement last week by fellow Big Five accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers.

Enron Officials Sought Lawyer's Dismissal Over Negotiations With Outside Partnership
By Tom Hamburger and John Emshwiller
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

WASHINGTON -- Enron Corp. executives tried to get one of the company's in-house lawyers fired in 2000 after their boss expressed unhappiness with the way the lawyer was negotiating with a partnership in which the boss had an interest, congressional investigators said. 
The disclosure underlined the conflicts of interest that apparently existed with outside partnerships set up and run by some Enron executives. For Enron, which is now in bankruptcy proceedings, the partnerships allowed the Houston energy-trading company to enhance its profits and to move debt off its books. But the partnerships also were used by some senior Enron executives to enrich themselves, according to an internal company report released this weekend.
The investigators' statements came as several congressional committees pushed forward with probes into Enron's collapse. A House and Senate panel each voted to issue subpoenas to force appearances by Kenneth Lay, Enron's former chairman and chief executive. Meanwhile, the head of Arthur Andersen, Enron's former auditor, was aggressively questioned before a House panel and outlined additional steps the accounting firm is taking to restore its reputation. 
At issue in the case involving the Enron lawyer was one of the outside partnerships known as LJM2. Enron attorney Joel Ephros was negotiating with attorneys for LJM2 from the law firm of Kirkland & Ellis in 2000, when he received an expletive-laced angry voice mail about his handling of the negotiation from Enron's Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Fastow, according to an account given to congressional investigators. Mr. Fastow at the time ran and had an ownership interest in LJM2, which eventually earned him substantial profits. 
Later, in the fall of 2000, two of Mr. Fastow's subordinates, Ben Glisan Jr. and Michael Kopper, approached Mr. Ephros's boss to accuse the lawyer of being unresponsive and incompetent and to urge his dismissal. The boss, Jordan Mintz, general counsel of Enron Global Finance, had just started his new job and said he wasn't prepared to make any personnel moves, so he declined. Informed of the decision, Mr. Fastow didn't object. Mr. Mintz later decided to keep Mr. Ephros on staff and praised his performance. 
The attempt to fire Mr. Ephros will be aired at a hearing tomorrow before the House Energy and Commerce Committee's oversight panel, Billy Tauzin, chairman of the full committee, said in an interview. The Louisiana Republican offered the episode as an example of what he called a corrupt culture within Enron as it sought to inflate revenue and conceal losses using entities such as LJM2. 
"They literally became sham operations," said Mr. Tauzin, who is leading the most aggressive probe of nearly a dozen now being conducted on Capitol Hill into Enron. "One purpose was to fool investors into believing that debt had moved, that risk had moved. And the other purpose was to create phony income. This is an old game. This is nothing new. This is insider theft." 
Mr. Mintz will be a chief witness at tomorrow's hearing and is expected to detail his recollections about the effort made to muzzle Mr. Ephros. A spokesman for Mr. Fastow declined to comment. A lawyer for Mr. Glisan didn't return a call for comment. Mr. Ephros and Mr. Kopper couldn't be reached. Mr. Tauzin said he expects Messrs. Fastow and Kopper to invoke their Fifth Amendment rights against possible self-incrimination to avoid testifying at tomorrow's hearing. 
The Ephros episode is an example of a problem addressed cryptically in the internal report by a special committee of Enron's board that was released last weekend. Mr. Fastow "was in a position to exert great pressure and influence. . . . We have been told of instances in which he used that pressure to try to obtain better terms for LJM," the report said. "Simply put, there was little of the separation and independence required to enable Enron employees to negotiate effectively against LJM2." 
Mr. Tauzin said that tomorrow's hearing will also feature details of what he called "literally a sweetheart deal" involving another partnership. According to Mr. Tauzin and his investigators, one of the partnership deals was cut by two Enron employees who were engaged to be married, one representing Enron and one representing LJM2. 
Congressional investigators said that the agreement netted huge profits for the couple, Trushar Patel, an Enron attorney, and his fiancee, Anne C. Yaeger, who worked with Mr. Fastow and later left Enron. Ms. Yaeger signed a $30 million agreement on behalf of LJM2, listing herself as an "authorized person," documents shows. Her husband signed representing Enron. 
Committee spokesman Ken Johnson said investigators have learned Ms. Yaeger entered into the transaction by initially providing just $10 as a down payment, later kicking in an additional $2,913. "We believe she walked away from the deal with a profit of half a million dollars," Mr. Johnson said. "That's not a bad return for a $10 initial investment." 
Messages left at the home of the couple weren't returned. 
In other action, the Senate Commerce Committee and the House Financial Services Committee approved subpoenas for Mr. Lay to appear before their panels on Feb. 12 and 14, respectively. Mr. Lay had agreed to appear at hearings this week, but backed out in response to scathing criticism from Capitol Hill prompted by revelations in the Enron board's internal report. Though he will be forced to appear, he can refuse to testify by invoking the Fifth Amendment, and several senators and House members predicted he would do so. Kelly Kimberly, Mr. Lay's spokeswoman, said he and his lawyers haven't yet decided whether he will testify. 
In his second appearance before the House Financial Services panel, Andersen CEO Joseph Berardino outlined new steps the accounting firm will take to restore confidence in its work, including creating offices for audit quality, ethics and compliance. Mr. Berardino came under heavy criticism from panel members for Andersen's role in the Enron affair, including a document-destruction effort undertaken by Houston-based employees, one of whom was subsequently fired. He said he was "embarrassed" by the shredding. On Andersen's role in reviewing questionable partnership transactions, which later led to Enron's collapse, he reiterated his assertion that "information was withheld" by Enron as Andersen was reviewing them. 
The difficulty Mr. Berardino faces in restoring confidence in his company was made clear in Connecticut yesterday as the state's Board of Accountancy escalated its investigation of the firm, issuing a subpoena for Enron-related documents. The state could revoke Andersen's license to practice in Connecticut and levy a fine. State Attorney General Richard Blumenthal says his staff is searching for common policies between Andersen's activities in Houston and Hartford. He added that other state attorneys general have been in contact with him and could pursue similar actions.

ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: THE TRANSACTIONS
The Financial Wizard Tied to Enron's Fall
By DAVID BARBOZA and JOHN SCHWARTZ

02/06/2002
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 2
c. 2002 New York Times Company

HOUSTON, Feb. 5 -- Before the financial shell games; before Chewco, Raptor and LJM; before the partnerships that earned him $30 million, Andrew S. Fastow had his first setback at the Enron Corporation. 
The setback came in 1996, when Mr. Fastow, a rising young star in corporate finance, was nearly fired for the poor job he did running a retail unit that aimed to put Enron into competition with local utilities around the country.
Mr. Fastow, whose surname rhymes with how, was simply out of his element among the intricacies of the retail market, colleagues said and his spokesman, Gordon Andrew, acknowledged. Yet while Enron was notorious for its cutthroat corporate culture, its succeed-or-leave ethic, Mr. Fastow had enough influence to return to his old department, finance. 
''What the guy knew was numbers and finance,'' a longtime colleague said. ''He knew how to close a deal. No one did that better than Andy.'' 
Today, investigators think that Mr. Fastow's financial wizardry, his ability to wrap the company's assets and debts into complicated off-balance-sheet deals, was a central cause of Enron's undoing. What Mr. Fastow presented as an arrangement intended to benefit Enron, according to a report released on Saturday by a special committee of the board, ''became, over time, a means of enriching himself personally, and facilitating manipulation of Enron's financial statements.'' 
No one yet knows how much of the blame for Enron's collapse should fall upon Mr. Fastow. On Thursday, Mr. Fastow, 40, a father of two who was Enron's chief financial officer until he was forced to resign in October, is expected to invoke his Fifth Amendment right rather than give potentially self-incriminating answers to questions from members of Congress. 
The crucial question is whether Mr. Fastow was the mastermind behind Enron's most suspect financing deals. Or was he, as Mr. Fastow has maintained through a spokesman, merely doing, with the board's knowledge, the bidding of his superiors at Enron, the former chief executives, Kenneth L. Lay and Jeffrey K. Skilling? 
Even before Mr. Fastow's appearance on Capitol Hill, Representative James C. Greenwood, Republican of Pennsylvania, called him the ''Betty Crocker of cooked books.'' And today, in one Congressional hearing, William C. Powers Jr., an Enron director who led the committee that wrote the internal report, said Mr. Fastow had been plagued by dual loyalties. ''Fastow couldn't mind the store,'' Mr. Powers said, ''because he was involved in the transactions.'' 
For now, Mr. Fastow is not telling his story. He declined to be interviewed for this article, and he refused to cooperate with a special investigative committee for Enron's board. He also invoked his right against self-incrimination at a meeting a few weeks ago with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
But the portrait that is emerging of Mr. Fastow, from interviews with former colleagues and details from the Enron special report, is that of a brilliant, ambitious and hard-charging executive who, it appears, grew obsessed with using complex financing techniques to supercharge Enron's earnings while inflating his own paycheck. 
Besides the $30 million he made in the LJM partnerships, Mr. Fastow earned a hefty salary and stock options at Enron. In 1999 and 2000, he sold about $23 million in Enron stock. 
It was not as if he needed the money, his friends say; his wife, the former Lea Weingarten, is the heiress to a Houston real estate fortune. But Mr. Fastow was adamant, friends say, in his belief that the amount of money a person made was the only meaningful measure of success in business. 
Even after Mr. Fastow retreated into seclusion last fall, he continued building an 11,500-square-foot house in Houston's wealthy River Oaks neighborhood. The Fastows also maintain an art collection, some of which has been displayed at the Contemporary Arts Museum and at the Menil Collection, both in Houston. 
He also had a prominent role in Houston's Jewish community, taking charge of fund-raising for the city's new Holocaust museum. 
''The work was significantly greater than the reward,'' said Bobby Lapin, a lawyer who has known Mr. Fastow for years. ''The person I know bears absolutely no relation to the person who has been characterized, in some reports, within the walls of Enron.'' 
But the focus on Capitol Hill is not on good deeds. 
According to the internal report, Mr. Fastow and a group of other top executives secretly invested in a series of partnerships that benefited from swapping assets with Enron. Mr. Fastow used some of those partnerships to conceal losses at Enron. He used others to inflate profits, by about $1 billion in a 12-month period in 2000 and 2001. And in one instance, he invested $25,000 in Southampton Place, a partnership that in a matter of two months made $4.5 million from a deal with Enron, the special report said. 
That transaction, and many others, were never disclosed to Enron's directors, the report said. The $4.5 million would eventually reach Mr. Fastow through a family foundation he had set up as a charity. 
The collapse of Enron is a dramatic reversal of fortune for Mr. Fastow. Until last August, when Mr. Skilling resigned as chief executive, Mr. Fastow was at his side constantly, a crucial player in winning Enron acclaim as one of the world's most innovative companies. 
He arrived at the company in 1990, at age 29, a handsome, talented and ambitious man who would eventually assume the job of chief financial officer in 1998 at the age of 36. 
A graduate of Tufts University and the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern, Mr. Fastow was helping to refashion a gas pipeline company into something more akin to a Wall Street trading house. 
Those who knew Mr. Fastow at Enron described a man with twin personalities. They say he could be charming yet aggressive, quiet yet mercurial, and philanthropic yet bent on accumulating the trappings of wealth. 
''He was very smart and very good at what he did,'' one former executive said. ''He could be nice, but he could also be quite volatile and short-tempered. He didn't have a lot of patience with people who weren't as smart as him.'' 
Andrew Stuart Fastow was born in Washington but grew up in New Providence, N.J., the son of a buyer for supermarkets and department stores. His career started in Chicago in the 1980's, at Continental Bank, where he worked on ''troubled loans,'' and more complicated deals, like leveraged buyouts. 
At Enron, he started by trying to arrange financing for Mr. Skilling's innovative plan, the creation of a ''gas bank'' that would help struggling energy companies by providing them with loans in exchange for their oil and gas reserves, which Enron could hedge and trade against in its growing derivatives unit. 
Enron later began supporting energy producers by creating partnerships that allowed the company to keep the debt off the balance sheet. The first of those partnerships was named Cactus. 
By 1993, the partnerships Mr. Fastow helped set up were so successful that Calpers, the California Public Employees' Retirement System, approached Enron about a joint venture. The partnership was called JEDI, or the Joint Energy Development Investments. 
Later, there were hundreds of other partnerships, with names like Obi 1, Chewco and Raptor. 
In recent years, as Enron pushed to build power plants and to develop new markets, the company needed huge amounts of capital, and partnerships were one way to pay for the projects without having the debt accumulate on Enron's balance sheet. 
In 1999, CFO magazine honored Mr. Fastow for creating an innovative financing structure. In a rare interview, he told CFO that he would use off-balance-sheet transactions to avoid weakening Enron's credit rating. And he would do this while operating in the shadows. 
''This guy was never anything but low profile,'' said John E. Olson, an energy analyst at Sanders Morris Harris. ''He rarely, if ever, showed up at analyst meetings. He was a loan consolidator.'' 
By 1999, there were small fissures in Mr. Fastow's labyrinthine financing empire. As early as 1997, Enron had difficulty finding a partner to buy out Calpers's interest. So, apparently to skirt disclosure rules, Mr. Fastow proposed listing his wife's family as outside investors. When he was rebuffed, Michael Kopper, who worked under Mr. Fastow at Enron, was selected. Because he was a lower-level employee, Enron would not have to disclose his interest in S.E.C. filings. Mr. Kopper would eventually make at least $10 million in profit from the venture. 
Later, Mr. Fastow dealt with partnerships that involved at least four other Enron employees. 
Mr. Fastow, the board report said, often played dual roles as an Enron executive and a partner of LJM. Once, he found himself at odds with Enron Broadband Services. ''Fastow's involvement caused great distress for the E.B.S. team,'' the special report said. ''They understood that their job was to get the best deal possible for Enron but driving a hard bargain for Enron drew the ire of Enron's C.F.O.' 
Others, who worked closely with Mr. Fastow, say he was not a rogue operator. ''I think there's too much focus on Andy,'' one longtime colleague said. Mr. Fastow, the colleague said, did not do anything on his own. 
Other colleagues say it is quite possible Mr. Fastow took charge himself, that he got wrapped up in a series of complex transactions that ultimately doomed him. And even when it was all falling apart, Mr. Fastow was reluctant to acknowledge what was happening. 
In October, after the company was forced to restate its earnings but before he left, Mr. Fastow appeared at an employee meeting at the Hyatt Regency hotel here. His remarks were brief and mysterious. ''The Enron Corporation's balance sheet,'' one employee recalls him saying, ''has never been in better health.''

Enron CEO Felt 'Betrayed,' Panel Told; Head of Internal Probe Testifies on the Hill

Former Enron Corp. chairman Kenneth L. Lay told investigators for the Enron board that he should have paid more attention to his company's bookkeeping but felt "betrayed" by others at the company who kept information from him, the board's lead investigator testified yesterday. 
Lay, in four hours of interviews with the special board committee investigating the company's collapse, indicated that he knew the company was using Enron stock to protect investors in its off-the-books partnerships, said William C. Powers Jr., chairman of the committee, which issued its report Saturday.
That unusual strategy helped Enron hide large debts and losses. 
"When we interviewed Mr. Lay . . . he didn't understand or appreciate there was anything wrong with it," Powers, dean of the University of Texas Law School, told the House Government Reform subcommittee on oversight and investigations. Lay's story was that "the accountants had signed off on it," Powers said. "It was a credible device." 
Powers also disclosed that the Enron board's investigative committee spent "a couple of hours" interviewing former Enron vice chairman J. Clifford Baxter, who was found dead on Jan. 25 of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Powers said Baxter gave no hint that he was "a person . . . in danger." 
House members asked Powers for notes or recordings from that interview. Powers said he could not turn the records over without permission from the company, but he said he would support their release. Enron attorney Robert Bennett later said the company "certainly will provide the materials requested." 
Committees in the Senate and House yesterday subpoenaed Lay to appear on Capitol Hill on Feb. 12 and 14. Lay, who withdrew from a scheduled appearance Monday, is expected to invoke his constitutional right against self-incrimination and refuse to testify, but the subpoenas mean he will have to do so in person in the full glare of publicity. 
Meanwhile, members of a Financial Services subcommittee unleashed their wrath on Arthur Andersen chief executive Joseph F. Berardino, blasting the big accounting firm's audits of Enron and voicing exasperation when Berardino said he didn't know the answers to many of their questions about Andersen's conduct. 
"Maybe it's better to be dumb than culpable, but we want some answers," said Rep. Gary L. Ackerman (D-N.Y.). 
"I mean, your ship is going to go down and you're going to be lashed to the mast unless you start talking to us about what happened." 
Berardino, who headed Andersen's audit practice before becoming its chief executive about a year ago, said Andersen was still trying to gather the facts. 
"I don't know, with authority, what we knew and when we knew it," he told the Financial Services subcommittee on capital markets, one of several congressional panels investigating Enron's collapse. 
Separately, a spokesman for Andersen said yesterday that its auditors went to Enron's board earlier than was previously known with concerns about possible illegal activity. 
The first approach was in August, after the emergence of a letter from executive Sherron Watkins to Lay warning of widespread accounting irregularities, spokesman Charlie Leonard said. 
Federal law requires auditors to alert the SEC when they suspect illegality and the board or management does not address it. In this case, Andersen personnel went to the board but not to the SEC because they were assured the board was investigating the matter, Leonard said. 
Andersen previously said it had alerted the board to possible illegal activities last fall as Enron unraveled. 
As lawmakers search for ways to prevent future Enrons, Rep. Richard H. Baker (R-La.), chairman of the House subcommittee, floated what would be a fundamental change in the auditing business -- having stock exchanges hire the auditors. Currently, auditors are hired by the companies they are responsible for auditing -- an arrangement that some lawmakers say deters them from challenging dubious corporate accounting. 
In other developments yesterday, President Bush rejected a call by Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.) for a special prosecutor to investigate Enron, saying his Justice Department could do the job. Enron was a major contributor to the Bush presidential campaign and has ties to a number of administration officials. 
The House Energy and Commerce Committee yesterday subpoenaed former Enron chief financial officer Andrew S. Fastow to appear at a hearing tomorrow. Fastow's attorneys originally told the committee he would appear voluntarily, but they later informed the committee he had "a change of heart," committee spokesman Ken Johnson said. Fastow, who organized some of Enron's largest partnerships and earned at least $30 million from running them, intends to assert his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, Johnson said, but he will be required to do that in front of the committee. 
Fastow has hired criminal lawyer John Keker of San Francisco, who prosecuted Oliver L. North in the Iran-contra affair, to represent him in the Justice Department's criminal investigation.

$270 Million Man Stays in the Background

Lou Pai struck many colleagues as the brightest brain at Enron. Others say he was notable for helping to produce some of the company's biggest business disasters while head of Enron Energy Services, the Houston firm's effort to sell electricity to retail customers. 
The 54-year-old Pai certainly stands out as the company's biggest winner amid financial devastation -- he sold $270 million of Enron stock in the 16 months before he resigned last July.
Because of his stock sales, he, along with other senior Enron executives and board members, is being sued by shareholders. But so far he is one of the second-tier players in the Enron drama. He was not named in the Enron board's special report on the partnerships run by the company's chief financial officers. He has not been called to testify by the myriad congressional committees probing Enron's collapse. 
But Pai's role at Enron illustrates some central themes in the company's rise and fall, according to former executives and colleagues. 
His windfall from Enron stock sales highlights a compensation strategy that provided huge rewards to top executives who launched new business or created major new trading opportunities for the Houston company. Some company critics say this reward structure led Enron to take greater and greater business risks that finally caught up with the company last year. 
There are allegations that the retail energy business Pai headed until last year racked up hundreds of millions of dollars in trading losses in 2000, according to a memo written by former Enron manager Margaret Ceconi. She contends that those losses were effectively hidden when the division was combined with a much larger wholesale energy operation around March 2001. 
An Enron spokesman has disputed that allegation. 
Pai, who lives with his second wife in Houston's Sugar Land suburb, declined, through one of his attorneys, to be interviewed for this report. 
A source close to Pai said Pai "doesn't know anything" about the alleged hidden losses. She called Pai "a consummate professional" who also knows nothing about the partnerships accused of hiding company losses and inflating earnings. "Lou was an operations guy" who had "nothing to do with accounting," she said. 
Pai is "a very quiet guy," the source added. "If you walked into a room of people, you would not pick him out as the guy with all the money," she said. 
There were signs Pai was willing to spend freely, however. He, and possibly other partners, bought 77,000 acres of Colorado mountain land since 1999 for at least $23 million, according to press reports in that state. 
In the spring of 2000, about the time he was going through a divorce, Pai was intent on buying a house. He told people he wanted to have a home for his son to visit during a break from college. 
The house he chose in the Tanglewood section of Houston had been on the market for only a day or two. He paid just over $900,000 in cash, according to a person familiar with the deal. "There was hardly anybody ever at the house. Within six months, the house was back on the market," the person said. 
The source close to Pai said he used tens of millions of dollars of the proceeds from his Enron stock sales for his divorce settlement in 2000. 
Pai is the son of a distinguished aeronautics engineering professor at the University of Maryland, Shih-I Pai, who died in 1996. He himself earned an undergraduate degree at Maryland in 1970 and a master's degree in economics there three years later. 
Pai worked at Conoco Inc., another energy company, before joining Enron in 1987. Three years later he was part of a new group of executives forming around Jeffrey K. Skilling -- later the company's chief executive -- bent on turning Enron from a dowdy natural gas pipeline company into a fast-paced energy-trading firm. 
Quiet-spoken and diminutive, Pai did not push his way into discussions, associates said. He did win notice for his ability to devise ingenious energy-trading strategies that covered a variety of business risks, including sharp swings in prices and changes in the weather, they added. 
Working first for the corporate planning group, he helped set up one of the company's first risk-management units. It used complex financial contracts to help protect Enron's natural gas investments against sharp price swings. 
That became a model for Enron's wholesale electricity-trading business, Enron Capital & Trade Resources, which led in turn to the creation of the company's retail energy unit. 
Pai's expertise was strong enough to insulate him from the first of his setbacks as a manager, Enron's attempt to sell retail electricity to households and commercial customers in California and East Coast states as energy deregulation began in those states in the mid-1990s. 
In 1997, Pai became chairman of Enron Energy Services (EES), the company unit handling retail energy marketing. Thomas E. White, now secretary of the Army, was vice chairman of the unit from 1998 until last year. 
A year later, however, after spending $15 million to promote the unit's services with Super Bowl ads and other promotions, Enron gave up in California -- the costs of competing against the state's utilities were too high. 
Outside California, the move toward electricity deregulation was halting, despite state-by-state lobbying by Enron's political teams. 
But Pai wasn't through, and EES shifted its sights to large commercial and industrial customers while spinning off its power-marketing operation for households to a new subsidiary called New Power Co. 
In one interview in 2000, Skilling called Pai "my ICBM," an intellectual missile instantly launched at new ventures. "He can conceptualize it, bring in the right people, and get it up and running fast," Skilling said. 
But the creation of New Power as a separate unit was an admission that EES had failed at consumer retailing, said Marc E. Manly, a managing director of New Power, now a separate company. 
"They didn't know how to do it," Manly said of Enron's efforts in the field. "They failed miserably." While remaining at Enron and EES, Pai was given the chairmanship of New Power when Enron spun it off as a publicly traded firm in 2000. 
He showed his loyalty by investing $5 million in New Power. And Enron reciprocated, giving Pai 2 million shares of New Power stock. 
"That was an arrangement with Lou," Manly said. "He was in at the beginning of this, the originator of the idea of the company, and Enron worked out a compensation arrangement. . . . We had to abide by the commitment Enron had made with Lou." 
Pai is listed in the latest New Power company filings as its largest single shareholder, with 3.4 million shares. While Pai's timing in his sales of Enron shares was fortunate, that wasn't the case with New Power. 
The stock went public in October 2000 at $21 a share. But the public's resistance to electricity deregulation after the California crisis and a steep drop in electricity prices has battered New Power's operations. It's stock closed yesterday at 36 cents a share. 
While running EES in 1999, Pai began purchasing the Taylor Ranch in southern Colorado, on the west side of a mountain range that rises to 14,000 feet and runs down almost to the New Mexico border. 
Exactly how much Pai owns and controls isn't clear. Before Pai bought the land, the owner had tried to keep local residents off the sprawling site, barring them from hunting and gathering wood. Pai has continued to oppose access and now is the target of a 20-year-old lawsuit over the issue. 
Lawyer Jeff Goldstein, who has represented local residents suing the ranch, said it's Pai's property. "There is no question that he is the principal. He goes there and seems to be running the show," Goldstein said. 
But as with Enron's entities, the exact ownership is murky, Goldstein said. The listed owners are partnerships.

THE NATION Enron Execs Sold Stock as Losses Grew Probe: The $44-million sell-off came amid concern that problems at partnerships could become public. The action raises questions of possible insider trading.

HOUSTON -- A handful of senior Enron Corp. executives sold $44 million in company stock while concerns were growing inside the company that losses racked up by a group of obscure partnerships could spill into public view, records show. 
The huge investment losses by the four so-called Raptor partnerships were disclosed months later and played a key role in forcing Enron in October to say it had overstated the value of the company by $1.2 billion, spurring the company's filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Dec. 2.
Stock sales by Enron executives before the company's descent previously have come under a spotlight, but the timing of the sales gained new significance with the release Saturday of an internal Enron investigation that detailed the executives' knowledge of the Raptor problems. 
Four Enron executives--including former President and Chief Executive Jeffrey K. Skilling and former Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow--sold about $44 million in stock from Aug. 7, 2000, when the Raptor problems became known internally, through March 26, 2001, when the partnerships were restructured to prevent disclosure of losses, according to a review of stock sales Tuesday. 
There is no evidence that the sales were directly related to knowledge of the problems facing the Raptors. But any stock sales by executives based on information not available to the public could be construed as trading on inside information, a federal crime, according to a Washington securities lawyer who declined to speak for attribution. 
The executives--Skilling, Fastow and Chief Accounting Officer Richard A. Causey and Chief Risk Officer Richard B. Buy--could not be reached for comment. 
During the period Aug. 7, 2000, to March 26, 2001, Skilling had stock sales totaling $28.2 million, and Fastow sales totaling $4.3 million, according to data compiled by Thomson Financial, a securities research firm. 
Causey's sales totaled $7.1 million and Buy's totaled $4.3 million, Thomson said. 
The sales came at a time when Enron executives were concerned that losses by the Raptors could force damaging public disclosure. The fear of disclosing those losses led Enron to expand and restructure the Raptors during an eight-month period in 2000-01 to keep its losses off the corporate books, according to an Enron board committee's internal report issued Saturday. 
Only an elaborate reorganization of the Raptors last March 26 saved Enron from having to disclose a $504-million loss on its first-quarter financial statements, according to Enron's internal report. 
Starting April 18, 2000, Enron created the first of four Raptor entities so that losses in its investment portfolio (including stocks) would not show up on Enron's income statement, the internal report said. The Raptors, which were little known beyond a small group of corporate insiders, allowed the energy company to hedge, or shield itself from, future losses on its investment portfolio by shifting some of the risk to the Raptors. 
Enron provided the initial funding for three of the Raptors with shares of its own stock. Each one also received a modest investment from a related partnership headed by Fastow. 
In essence, the Raptors agreed to cover potential losses on certain Enron investments. As long as the value of the Enron shares backing the Raptors held up, the entities would be able to pay their debts to the energy giant. Enron counted the debts owed by the Raptors as income, offsetting losses from its portfolio. 
Soon after creating the Raptors, however, Enron executives learned how quickly they could slip into trouble. 
According to the report, Skilling, Fastow, Causey and Buy attended an Aug. 7, 2000, meeting of Enron's finance committee in which Treasurer Ben Glisan noted that the credit capacity of Raptor I was "almost completely utilized and that Raptor II would not be available" until months later. The committee recommended creating a Raptor IV, but before that could be activated executives created, without board approval, Raptor III without informing the board. 
Unlike the other entities, Raptor III was not backed by Enron stock, making it what the internal investigation called an "extraordinarily fragile structure." 
One day after Raptor III became active, on Sept. 28, 2000, Causey exercised 61,097 stock options and sold an additional 19,536 shares, netting $5.4 million, according to the analysis by Thomson. That was one of only four days Enron's chief accounting officer has traded shares, according to Thomson. 
By late 2000, two of the entities, Raptor I and Raptor III, were essentially insolvent, lacking the credit to be able to pay back their debts, the report said. 
Raptor III was in especially bad shape. Unlike the three other entities, Raptor III was essentially backed by shares of New Power Co., an Enron spinoff that quickly foundered after going public. But under the deal designed by Enron accountants, the more that New Power shares fell, the more money Raptor III owed Enron. 
New Power went public Oct. 5, 2000. By mid-November, the stock had lost 50% of its value, threatening to wreak havoc with the Raptor structure and force Enron to disclose huge losses, according to the internal report. 
On Nov. 7, Fastow sold 52,080 shares at $83 each for a gross of $4.32 million. Filings reviewed by Thomson did not indicate Fastow's cost, so his net gain on the sales is unclear. Stock sales by Fastow earlier in the year--after the Raptors had been devised but before they showed signs of serious trouble--netted him an estimated $3.4 million. 
To avoid having to disclose a huge loss, Enron executives on Dec. 22, 2000, merged the credit of the four Raptors under a 45-day pact, allowing Enron to avoid reporting a credit-reserve loss in its year-end financial statements. 
In early January, Enron accountants began work to develop a more permanent solution to replace the 45-day agreement, according to the internal report. The accountants designed a complex restructuring that took effect March 26, 2001. 
"We were told that, during the first quarter of 2001, Skilling said that fixing the Raptors' credit capacity problems was one of the company's highest priorities," the report said. 
Skilling has disputed that account. He told the board investigation team, led by Texas Law School dean William Powers, that he recalls being informed of the Raptors' credit problems "in only general terms" and that he understood the matter to be "an accounting issue." 
The committee found that "either Skilling was not nearly as involved in Enron's business as his reputation--and his own description of his approach to the job--would suggest, or he was deliberately kept in the dark by those involved in the restructuring." 
By February 2001, Enron accountants were providing daily reports of the credit status of at least two of the Raptors to Causey and Buy, according to the internal report. 
Tension built through March 2001, according to the report, after executives became aware that Enron would have to take a pretax charge against earnings of about $504 million to reflect the shortfall in credit capacity of Raptors I and III. 
Buy, who had not traded any Enron shares since becoming Enron's chief risk officer in mid-1999, began an intense sell-off Jan. 2, 2001. According to Thomson's analysis, the 54,874 shares he sold from that date through March 5 of that year are the only shares he has sold since taking that post. The sales netted him an estimated $2.8 million. 
For his part, Enron's since-ousted chairman and chief executive, Kenneth L. Lay, knew of the creation of the Raptors, the internal report said. But investigators said they found no evidence that Lay, who stepped aside as CEO in February 2001 in favor of Skilling, was aware of the entities' debts and reorganization. 
On Aug. 24, 2000, Lay exercised 140,230 options and sold 75,000 shares, netting a $4.09-million profit on the day. On Nov. 1, he settled into a pattern, selling blocks of 1,000 to 4,000 shares almost every day until August 2001. 
In hindsight, the committee said, Enron's top executives, as well as outside advisors including accounting firm Andersen, should have kept closer oversight ofthe Raptors and other partnerships. 
"The creation, and especially the subsequent restructuring, of the Raptors was perceived by many within Enron as a triumph of accounting ingenuity by a group of innovative accountants," the committee report said. "We believe . . . especially after the restructuring, the Raptors were little more than a highly complex accounting construct that was destined to collapse."

ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: THE MANAGEMENT
2 Officials Are Expected To Leave the Company
By REED ABELSON

02/06/2002
The New York Times
Page 9, Column 5
c. 2002 New York Times Company

Two of the senior Enron executives who were sharply criticized in a report by a special committee of the board are expected to leave the company. 
Members of the senior staff at Enron have been told that Richard A. Causey, the chief accounting officer, and Richard B. Buy, the chief risk officer, are expected to leave the company and are currently negotiating the terms of their departures.
The situation is in flux, according to people close to the board. 
While the report examined the role of other executives who remain at Enron, including Jeffrey McMahon, Enron's new president, and James V. Derrick Jr., the general counsel, it focused on the responsibilities of Mr. Causey and Mr. Buy in providing accounting and risk-management controls at Enron. 
An Enron spokesman and a lawyer for Mr. Causey and Mr. Buy did not return phone calls seeking comment. 
None of the four executives had a direct role in the arrangement outlined in the report that used the partnerships to inflate profits and enrich some employees. But none of the executives alerted the board to troubling signs that these partnerships posed problems, according to the report. 
Mr. Causey, Mr. Buy and Mr. Derrick were all broadly responsible for overseeing what the company told investors about the partnerships, and they all played a part in the general oversight of Enron's finances. 
Mr. Derrick's lawyer, J. Clifford Gunter, said Mr. Derrick could not comment on the report. 
But the two executives with explicit duties to oversee the partnerships, reviewing transactions between the partnerships and the company, were Mr. Causey and Mr. Buy. While the report says they did not ignore their duties, ''they interpreted their roles very narrowly and did not give the transactions the degree of review the board believed was occurring.'' As the most senior accounting officer, Mr. Causey was ultimately responsible for Enron's financial reporting, according to the report. ''He presided over and participated in a series of accounting judgments that, based on the accounting advice we have received, went well beyond the aggressive,'' said the report. 
Mr. Causey also had a significant role in the decisions surrounding what Enron would make public, according to the report. Although the report depicted him as relying on the advice of the company's outside accountant, Arthur Andersen, he was described as ''the final arbiter of unresolved differences among the various contributors to the financial reporting process.'' 
The report concluded that Enron's disclosures, involving the compensation of the former chief financial officer involved in the partnerships and a variety of transactions between the partnerships and the company, ''were fundamentally inadequate.'' 
Because of Mr. Causey's specific responsibility ''with reviewing Enron's transactions with the LJM partnerships,'' he should have been in a position to provide advice concerning the disclosures, according to the report. ''The evidence we have seen suggests he did not.'' 
The report criticized Mr. Buy for neglecting his role in reviewing and approving all of the transactions between the partnerships and Enron. Mr. Buy never followed a procedure to identify all the transactions and did not, in the report's words, ''affirmatively'' carry out his responsibility for carefully reviewing the economic terms of all of the transactions. 
The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that both Mr. Causey and Mr. Buy were being placed on leave. 
The board's report provides less detail on the role of Mr. Derrick, Enron's general counsel, who oversaw the dozens of in-house lawyers involved. The report does, however, suggest that Mr. Derrick and Enron's in-house legal staff played some role in determining what Enron told the public, in conjunction with the company's outside accountants and lawyers. 
Mr. Derrick was also at the center of Enron's investigation of the concerns raised by Sherron S. Watkins, an Enron executive, last August, according to the report. In consultation with Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman, he selected Vinson & Elkins, despite potential conflicts, as the law firm to conduct the preliminary inquiry and severely limited its range. ''The scope and process of the investigation appear to have been structured with less skepticism than was needed to see through these particularly complex transactions,'' the report said. 
Even Mr. McMahon, who was named Enron's president last month as part of the team now leading Enron's restructuring, appears to be among the many executives who failed to speak up, according to the report. While Mr. McMahon raised doubts about the partnerships as early as March 2000, according to the report, he appears never to have voiced them to Mr. Lay or the board. 
All four executives were named in a lawsuit concerning possible insider trading because of their sales of Enron stock in recent years. According to the lawsuit, Mr. Causey sold $13.3 million in stock, Mr. Derrick sold $12.7 million, Mr. Buy sold $4.3 million and Mr. McMahon sold $2.7 million. Mr. Derrick never exercised a single option that was not about to expire, according to his lawyer. 
In the end, the report highlights what appear to be a series of failures of the various checks in place that led to $1 billion in false profits and the crisis in confidence that culminated in Enron's filing for bankruptcy last fall. At any point, concerns raised by the legal, accounting or risk-management executives involved might have prevented the company's collapse, according to Robert Mittelstaedt Jr., a professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. 
''It takes a whole series of mistakes to go so very badly,'' he said.

ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: CONGRESSIONAL MEMO
Investigators Buying Time For Inquiry
By DON VAN NATTA Jr.

The New York Times

c. 2002 New York Times Company

WASHINGTON, Feb. 5 -- Kenneth L. Lay backed out of his date with Congress this week, but his refusal to testify voluntarily only served to increase the resolve of politicians to get the truth about the fall of the Enron Corporation, even if they never get the opportunity to hear the former Enron chairman's side of the story. 
Two panels sent subpoenas today to Mr. Lay, but lawmakers said they were almost certain Mr. Lay would refuse to answer their questions and would instead invoke his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Two other former Enron executives, Andrew S. Fastow and Jeffrey K. Skilling, are also expected by lawmakers to decline to testify.
Yet in the end, the former Enron executives' refusal to cooperate may represent little more than a speed bump to the 11 Congressional inquiries focusing on the many strands of the largest bankruptcy case in American history, Congressional leaders and staff members said today. 
The extension of the Congressional inquiries is a mixed blessing for the White House because the Enron examination on Capitol Hill will continue to be a distraction from the Bush administration's war on terrorism and its efforts to invigorate the economy. 
Congressional staff members say the Enron executives' refusal to testify now will allow staff members more time to comb through more than two million Enron documents and assemble the many pieces of a very complex corporate puzzle. 
''It helps us more than it hurts us,'' Ken Johnson, spokesman for the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, said of the delay in hearing from the former executives. ''The game plan was always to bring in the underlings first and set the stage for an appearance by Mr. Lay and the other senior executives when we have more evidence.'' 
In 1994, as a House panel inquiry on the tobacco industry was just beginning, seven tobacco executives voluntarily testified and swore under oath that nicotine was not addictive and they did not market cigarettes to children. Later in the inquiry, the panel obtained a slew of documents that undercut many of the statements made by the tobacco executives. But when Republicans seized the leadership of the House in 1995, the executives were not required to testify again after the Republicans closed the inquiry. 
Mr. Lay's refusal to testify served as a reminder on Capitol Hill that the Bush administration has refused to cooperate with a related Congressional inquiry. Several Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill aimed their anger over Mr. Lay's refusal to cooperate squarely at the White House. 
The Bush administration has rejected a request by the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, for a list of energy industry executives, including some from Enron, who met with Vice President Dick Cheney's energy task force last year. The accounting office is expected to file a lawsuit against Mr. Cheney and the administration. 
''The appearance is awful,'' said Philip M. Schiliro, the chief of staff for Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California. ''Lay is reversing himself and refusing to voluntarily testify, and at the same time the administration is continuing to refuse to cooperate with the Congress. It's hard to believe that's a combination the administration wants.'' 
Mary Matalin, counselor to the vice president, portrayed some Democrats' anger at the White House as ''playing politics with Enron.'' 
''As we've been saying from the beginning, we are greatly saddened by the Democrats who prefer to play politics with this difficult issue as opposed to joining the president to form policies that will ensure this will never happen again,'' Ms. Matalin said. 
Another senior administration official scoffed at the idea that the Enron collapse was anything but a corporate scandal. ''People think Ken Lay is Satan,'' the official said. ''They don't think we are and they don't think some G.A.O. process story is the equivalent of lying and robbing people.'' 
Mr. Lay had agreed in December to appear on Feb. 4 before the Senate Commerce Committee. But his offer occurred before many of the most damning revelations about Enron, which was capped over the weekend by a highly critical report by a committee of Enron's board.

Enron Team Says Lay Took Some Blame Hearings: Former chief admits lapse in oversight, according to internal investigator questioned by lawmakers.

WASHINGTON -- Former Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth L. Lay acknowledged to company investigators that he should have kept a closer eye on the energy trader's financial operations, but he also pointed the finger at subordinates, the head of the company's internal investigation told Congress on Tuesday. 
"I think he felt he had not been watching carefully enough, but he certainly felt he had been betrayed," said William C. Powers, whose team interviewed Lay as part of a recently released report examining the company's collapse.
Meanwhile, lawmakers grilled Joseph F. Berardino, the head of Enron's former outside auditor, Andersen, for destroying thousands of documents related to Enron and for helping to create some of the off-the-books partnerships that led to Enron's demise. 
"Your company helped set these up," said Rep. Paul E. Kanjorski (D-Pa.). "You're not some innocent coming in here as an auditor and having all these transactions that are out there and you're just looking at them. You went through the intellectual analysis of how to do these things." 
House and Senate committees still want to hear directly from Lay, issuing subpoenas Tuesday for him to appear next week. He and another star witness--former Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow, who has been asked to appear on Thursday--are expected to invoke their 5th Amendment right against self-incrimination. 
Lay was summoned to appear Feb. 12 before the Senate Commerce Committee and Feb. 14 before the House Financial Services subcommittee on capital markets. 
Lay spokeswoman Kelly Kimberly, asked about whether Lay would invoke the 5th, said, "He is still determining his strategy for how to handle the hearings." 
Unable to hear from Lay, members of the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigations sought to find out from Powers, dean of the University of Texas law school who joined Enron's board last fall, exactly what the former Enron chief knew and when he knew it. 
The Houston-based energy company--once one of the nation's largest and best-connected corporations--sought bankruptcy protection Dec. 2 amid questions about its accounting practices. Less than a month before filing for Chapter 11, Enron revealed previously unreported losses of $586 million over the previous 4 1/2 years. 
Powers, whose team spent four hours interviewing Lay during its internal probe, said Lay was aware Enron was using company stock to hedge against investment losses. 
"He didn't understand or appreciate that there was anything wrong with that," Powers told the committee. "I don't know whether that's credible. That's his story." Lawmakers said they hope to secure notes of Powers' interviews of Lay and other senior officials. 
Powers' 203-page report, released late Saturday, concluded that accounting abuses masked more than $1 billion in losses in a one-year period and assigned widespread blame to Enron management, accounting firm Andersen, company lawyers and Enron's board for creating--and then failing to oversee--a series of partnerships that sparked the company's bankruptcy filing. The report noted that Lay, a major fund-raiser for President Bush, was "captain of the ship" for most of the time that abuses were occurring and "bears significant responsibility for ... flawed decisions" of subordinates. 
Powers said the Enron investigating team also met briefly with Fastow, but "very little information was forthcoming"--a sign of the challenge before Congress in grilling the man who is regarded as the expert on the partnerships. 
Powers told the committee that Andersen stopped cooperating with Enron's internal investigation once the company fired the accounting firm, saying the auditors had destroyed documents sought by government investigators. 
But Andersen's chairman, Berardino, said the firm offered to assist Powers but was not contacted by his team after the Jan. 17 firing. 
At his second appearance before a House Financial Services subcommittee, Berardino offered few new details about why Andersen destroyed documents and failed to warn investors about Enron's questionable accounting practices. 
Asked about the shredding, Berardino said, "I'm embarrassed by what happened at my firm." 
But Berardino repeatedly said he did not know the details of Andersen's business dealings with Enron, whether Andersen employees knew about problems or what documents were destroyed. "How could you not know?" asked Rep. Richard H. Baker (R-La.). 
"Maybe it's better to be dumb than culpable, but we want some answers," said Rep. Gary L. Ackerman (D-N.Y.). 
Andersen has not completed its own internal investigation into the Enron matter. Berardino disputed allegations in the Powers report that the firm was instrumental in creating some of the questionable partnerships. "It's not like we were running around town shopping these things," he said. He said Andersen merely reviewed proposals made by Enron managers. 
At a separate House hearing, Rep. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said that congressional investigators were finding that "there was no legitimate purpose in the construction of some of these deals except in the defrauding of investors." 
Investigators also have found that "some [investment] banks were told they'd get special bond deals if they would put the money up for some of the partnerships," Tauzin said. 
A Tauzin spokesman declined to elaborate.

Astros want out of naming-rights deal 
By ERIC BERGER 
Copyright 2002 Houston Chronicle 
Feb. 6, 2002, 1:55AM
Saying Enron's collapse has "tarnished the reputation of the Houston Astros," the club sought a court order Tuesday to get out of its naming-rights agreement with the company. 
With the 2002 season looming, lawyers for the team asked U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Arthur Gonzalez to force Enron to accept or reject the agreement that has kept the company's name on the ballpark and virtually all related materials since it opened. 
Enron almost certainly couldn't make another payment on the 30-year, $100 million contract, so it would have to relinquish the Enron Field name and allow the Astros to sell the rights to another bidder. 
"We felt like we needed to take an aggressive stance," said Astros owner Drayton McLane. "We just find it kind of embarrassing that we're tangled up in all of this." 
Since Enron filed for bankruptcy Dec. 2, McLane said, the team has tried to renegotiate the agreement, which also requires the company to lease a large luxury suite and buy 35 season tickets for box seats. 
McLane said he and his assistants have had one meeting with the company's then-chairman, Ken Lay, and more talks with other executives, including Cindy Olson, an Enron executive vice president. 
"Ken said he was going to follow through, but it just never unfolded," McLane said. 
Enron officials responded that their main concern is trying to recover some or all of the $3.4 million they paid the Astros last August. The next annual payment, for $3.65 million, is due Aug. 31. 
Company spokesman Mark Palmer said Enron is acting on behalf of its creditors. To comply with the terms of the contract, the company paid $108,000 for a 14-person luxury suite on Jan. 22, and nearly $90,000 for the 35 season box seats on Monday. 
"Let me get this right," Palmer said, "they're upset that we're living up to our contractual obligations?" 
With opening day less than two months away, the club faces the embarrassing possibility of having the Astros continually linked to a disgraced and bankrupt company. 
Palmer said Enron is ready to talk buyout. 
Because Enron has not defaulted on its payments, there is no way for the Astros to rename Enron field until at least Aug. 31 without negotiating an end to the contract or the judge compelling Enron to accept or reject it. A hearing has been set on the Astros' motion for Feb. 27 in the New York court. 
In a Chapter 11 bankruptcy the debtor, Enron in this case, does not have to accept or reject a contract until it files a reorganization plan, which likely won't happen until this summer, or later. 
In arguing their case, the Astros maintain the association with Enron has hurt their business. McLane said many people believe Enron owns a piece of the club. 
"One thing is clear: The Astros are being perceived in the public and cast in the national media as an affiliate (and even an ally) of Enron even though the Astros have done nothing wrong," Astros attorney Paul K. Ferdinands argues in the legal motion. 
"The court should not allow this irreparable harm to continue." 
In the motion, the Astros say the team has had to devote substantial resources to respond to a "deluge of daily inquiries" about the Astros' relationship with Enron. Also, fans and corporate sponsors may seek to distance themselves from the team because of the association with Enron. 
And the financial uncertainty of whether the company will make its $3.7 million payment this August affects the Astros' ability to field the best team possible, the motion states. 
Judge Gonzalez may well buy none of those arguments, said Nancy Rapoport, dean of the University of Houston Law Center and a bankruptcy law expert. 
"The judge is most likely to say, `Thank you for your motion,' " she said. "There's no rush and there may be more pressing executory contracts." 
At the heart of the dispute is whether Enron could re-license the ballpark's name to another company. In theory, they might be able to profit by selling the name for more than the annual payment to the Astros. 
The team says flatly that Enron cannot, and there are clauses in the contract prohibiting a re-licensing of the name. However, Rapoport said, in bankruptcy court such assignment clauses may not be enforced if they would be to the advantage of the debtor and its creditors. 
Beyond the assignment clauses, however, there is language in the naming rights contract that prevents the ballpark's name from being changed before 2009 without the club's consent, said Pam Gardner, president of business operations for the Astros. 
Even Gardner acknowledged, however, that all bets on even this type of language may be off in bankruptcy court. Either way, the team just wants Enron to be forced to accept or reject the contract, so the matter can be put to rest, she said. 
Despite the negative association with Enron, and a glum economy, there's a good chance the ballpark's name could be resold for $3.3 million annually, possibly even more, said Dean Bonham, of the Bonham Group, a Denver sports marketing firm. 
"I'm very bullish on the Astros eventually coming out on top in this financially," he said. "Part of it is it's quite likely there would be a good bit of public rejoicing for the company that comes in and removes the Enron name." 
McLane said three or four local companies have contacted him about the naming rights, though there have been no negotiations. Bonham said he, too, knows of several interested Houston companies.

For Houston Astros, a Sponsorship Turns Sour

At the start of the 2000 baseball season, when the gates opened at Enron Field, the Houston Astros' new, $250 million, state-of-the-art ballpark, "we just could not have been prouder to see that name up there," recalls Pam Gardner, the team's president of business operations. After all, Enron Corp. stood for vibrancy, for innovation, for success. 
"Unfortunately," Gardner noted yesterday, "things have changed."
Oh, have they ever. 
There's nothing proud about Houston-based Enron anymore. And the Astros, as Gardner politely put it, "would like to move in another direction" with the ballpark name. Worried about "the negative public perception" of the bankrupt, scandal-tainted energy trader, Gardner said, the team wants out of its 30-year, $100 million-plus naming rights contract with the company. But Enron won't play ball. 
The dispute, which surfaced yesterday, seems a mere sideshow to this week's congressional hearings on Enron's questionable financial practices. But as Astros officials see it -- staring up at that name, writ bright and huge on a facade high above the right field seats, among other places -- their lovely, 42,000-seat stadium might as well be called "Bankruptcy Ballpark." 
"It's a perception issue," Gardner said. 
The problem for the Astros is that Enron, despite its financial problems, has been making its annual payments under the contract, and its next installment, $3.7 million, isn't due until August. Enron also has held up its contract obligations on leasing a luxury box and buying season tickets, Gardner said. 
"We are continuing to honor our agreement," Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said, adding that the naming rights "are a valuable asset, and it is our responsibility to preserve that asset for [Enron's] creditors." She said lawyers for Enron are reviewing the contract to determine whether the rights could be sold, to help satisfy Enron's creditors. 
Astros lawyers say the contract does not allow such a sale, Gardner said. 
Denne suggested that Enron would agree to give up the naming rights for a price. "We've had some discussions, but they haven't offered to do that," she said of a potential buyout. 
Gardner said Astros officials have scoffed at the idea. 
It remains to be seen whether the bankruptcy court in New York that is handling Enron's case will let the company retain the naming rights when the next contract payment comes due in August. The Astros this week asked the court to decide the issue now, rather than wait until summer. 
"The allegations against Enron have been overwhelming," Gardner said. "Fan response has intensified in the last several weeks. A lot of people think the relationship between Enron and the Astros is stronger and closer than just a sponsorship agreement." 
The team and company used to have a strong and close relationship. 
Enron's then-chairman, Kenneth L. Lay, "did a whole lot of work to get this [stadium] built downtown," Gardner said. "He was instrumental in the process, talking to a lot of people, convincing a lot of people that it was the right thing to do." 
The ballpark, with its natural grass and nostalgic design, is owned by the Harris County-Houston Sports Authority and leased to the Astros for $7 million a year. It replaced the Astrodome as the team's home. 
Opening day is less than two months away. 
And the Astros are anxious. "When you're a baseball team, you're viewed as a public trust," Gardner said. "We don't want everybody focusing on the name of our field."

ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: A SPORTS CONNECTION
Astros Cry Foul and Try for an Enron Pickoff Play
By JONATHAN D. GLATER

It is not often that a Major League Baseball team wants to prevent a corporation from buying box seats and other stadium goodies, but then, it is not often that a big company loses billions of dollars in shareholder equity before going spectacularly bankrupt in an exploding accounting scandal. 
That company, of course, is Enron, and the baseball team is the Houston Astros, which barring some change will start the season playing at Enron Field.
Yesterday, the Astros asked a federal bankruptcy court to force Enron either to pledge to honor its obligations under a contract that gives the stadium its name or to reject the contract and free the Astros to negotiate a naming deal with somebody else. The Astros say that for Enron to continue to make payments under the name contract costs its creditors money and will earn them nothing; Enron says it can sell the right to name the stadium to another company. 
So far, Enron has complied with its obligations to the Astros, and lawyers say its contract can be sold to a third party with the blessing of the bankruptcy court. Enron has paid $75,890 for 35 box seats, said Karen Denne, a spokeswoman for the company; the next payment is not due until August. 
''That naming rights agreement is a valuable asset and the creditors view it as a valuable asset,'' Ms. Denne said. ''It was our responsibility to preserve the value, and we're doing that.'' 
The Astros say that Enron cannot comply with the terms of the agreement and that they want to be able to resell the lucrative naming right to another company. 
''This was not our preferred way to go about this,'' said Pam Gardner, president of business operations for the Astros. ''Since this started a few months ago, we've been trying to work in a new direction'' through negotiations with Enron, she said, but those negotiations did not resolve the dispute. 
Sandra Mayerson, a lawyer representing several creditors in Enron's bankruptcy proceedings, said it was possible that the bankruptcy court could override terms of the the Astros agreement with Enron to allow the company to sell the naming rights. And it is in everyone's interest to rename the field, she added. ''Wouldn't you be kind of anxious to go ahead and have it renamed?''

Questioning the Books: Enron's Fall Spurs Desire to Revisit Laws
By Greg Hitt
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

WASHINGTON -- The chairman of one of the leading congressional committees investigating the collapse of Enron Corp. says he expects to make a major legislative push this year to address problems arising from the debacle. 
Republican Rep. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin of Louisiana said he wants his House Energy and Commerce Committee to tighten the rules governing investments in the sort of off-balance-sheet partnerships Enron used to hide debt. He also is calling for pension reforms, citing concern about Enron workers who lost their retirement savings. And he voiced support for greater scrutiny -- while not ruling out complete elimination -- of the common corporate practice of having one accounting firm audit the books as well as consult on business practices, as was the case with Enron and its accounting firm, Arthur Andersen LLP.
"We can see several things emerging" from the congressional hearings, Mr. Tauzin said. 
At the same time, though, he warned against legislative overreach, suggesting too-aggressive action "could create incredible problems for the stock market and for investors." He also voiced misgivings about efforts by some on Capitol Hill to turn Enron's collapse into an overtly political matter. 
"My concern is that -- because Democrats have decided to `Enronize' Republicans on this issue -- that the thing gets bogged down politically, and to me that's terrible," Mr. Tauzin said in an interview. "We owe a bigger obligation to the country than an election in November." 
Mr. Tauzin's comments provided the clearest indication yet that lawmakers, despite the distractions of the unfolding election year, won't be content to simply probe Enron's failure. 
In the Senate, key members of the Banking Committee, having lost faith in the accounting industry in the wake of Enron, signaled support for direct federal oversight. Sens. Richard Shelby (R., Ala.) and Christopher Dodd (D., Conn.) said the privately funded accounting group that regulates the industry, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, should be brought under the government control. 
"Can the accounting profession police themselves?" Mr. Shelby asked. "I don't think they can." 
In an appearance before the Senate panel, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan agreed changes are needed but cautioned prudence. "It's important to ask what are the consequences," he said. 
Mr. Tauzin, whose panel has sweeping jurisdiction over business regulation in the U.S., is seen as a good barometer of the legislative outlook in the GOP-controlled House. 
As with Mr. Greenspan, Mr. Tauzin, too, counseled some caution. He described the problems at Enron as an "aberration," not necessarily an indication of systemic problems in the business community. And he urged regulators -- such as the Securities and Exchange Commission and the FASB, which has quasi-government status -- to begin moving ahead of Congress to respond to perceived problems. 
But he also made clear his intention to act. "Our obligation to supervise the operation of FASB is real, and I'm going to exercise it," he said. 
Mr. Tauzin cited specific concern with existing accounting rules that allowed Enron to create off-book partnerships with outside investments of as little as 3% and the balance of funding coming from the company. 
"It's a surprise to a lot of people that such a rule exists," he said, suggesting he "thought it was always 50%." He added, "I should think we ought to have a better rule than that." 
Describing the current situation as "not adequate," Mr. Tauzin also indicated his intention to wade into the debate over whether to separate the bookkeeping and consulting services offered by accounting firms. "We have to examine that now in light of Enron," he said. He suggested he is "ready to conclude that we need stronger" oversight of those two accounting roles, but he hasn't yet determined where to draw the line legislatively.

Former chairman of Enron to face lawmakers next week 
By JULIE MASON 
Copyright 2002 Houston Chronicle Washington Bureau 
Feb. 6, 2002, 12:21AM
WASHINGTON -- After abruptly canceling on lawmakers Sunday, former Enron Corp. Chairman Ken Lay will answer next week two congressional subpoenas issued Tuesday on Capitol Hill. 
It was unclear whether Lay would answer questions or refuse to testify. 
"I'll bet you a dollar to a doughnut that he doesn't testify and invokes his right under the Fifth Amendment," said Sen. John Breaux, D-La. The amendment guarantees protection against self-incrimination. 
The Senate Commerce Committee is requiring Lay to appear Tuesday, while the House Financial Services Committee has ordered that he appear on Feb. 14, Valentine's Day. Lawmakers said Tuesday the more they learn about the collapse of Enron, the greater the urgency to hear from the former chairman. 
"Any of Enron's officers who claim they didn't know isn't telling the truth," said Rep. Peter Deutsch, D-Fla., "No one has ever accused these people of being stupid." 
Lay for months has remained silent on his role in the complicated outside partnerships and other factors being blamed for the company's stunning financial free-fall. 
In testimony Tuesday, an in-house Enron investigator told lawmakers that Lay failed to closely monitor events leading up to Enron's collapse, and now feels betrayed by other executives. 
Enron attorney Bob Bennett declined to comment on Lay's plans for answering the subpoenas, while Lay spokeswoman Kelly Kimberly confirmed he would appear, but said strategy was still under discussion. 
Lay's attorney Earl Silbert did not return calls. Lay was to have testified before lawmakers this week, but declined to do so less than 24 hours before he was to appear. 
"It's unfortunate that Mr. Lay didn't appear voluntarily as he promised," Rep. Michael Oxley, R-Ohio, and committee chairman, said as he signed the subpoena. "We thought we were dealing in good faith with Mr. Lay and his attorney." 
Lawmakers are not inclined to barter immunity for Lay's testimony, although several expressed continued frustration at his unwillingness to answer questions. 
"Mr. Lay, wherever you are," said Rep. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin, R-La., "Get yourself some new lawyers, sir." 
Tauzin was among a number of lawmakers blamed by Silbert over the weekend for creating a "prosecutorial" atmosphere that forced Lay to cancel his congressional testimony. 
What Lay knew and when he knew it are key pursuits for congressional investigators, as more than 10 different committees have launched probes of the company's downfall. 
On Capitol Hill, the oversight and investigations subcommittee of the House Energy and Finance Committee closely questioned William Powers, dean of the University of Texas law school, about his own probe of Lay and other Enron executives. 
Powers, a specially appointed board member named to conduct the internal investigation, on Saturday released a report criticizing company executives, auditors, lawyers and board members for allowing improperly created partnerships to inflate Enron's earnings, hide its debt and wrongfully enrich a handful of insiders. 
"I think he felt that he had not been watching carefully enough," Powers said of Lay. "He felt he had been betrayed." 
Powers said that in four hours of interviews with internal investigators, Lay expressed a lack of familiarity with some of the issues now under scrutiny in the probe of Enron's collapse. 
For example, Lay was at an executive committee meeting where one of the complicated outside partnerships was approved, but he told Powers' internal committee that he did not recall the name of that entity. 
There were other matters that Lay knew about, but didn't perceive as problematic, Powers said. 
"Mr. Lay fully understood they were using their own stock to offset their losses," Powers said. "He didn't understand or appreciate that there was anything wrong with that." 
Rep. James Greenwood, R-Pa., chairman of the subcommittee, noted the partnerships set up by Enron executives used names from the Star Wars movies, such as Jedi and Chewco, for Chewbacca. 
With reference to the hero and the villain of Star Wars, Greenwood asked Powers of Lay, "Is he Luke Skywalker or is he Darth Vader?" 
Powers replied, "He is not Luke Skywalker. He certainly is responsible for letting this happen, and there certainly were red flags that he chose to ignore." 
While congressional rhetoric increasingly targets Lay and his oversight of Enron, other executives scheduled to testify are coming under added scrutiny as well. 
In the House subcommittee hearing, one lawmaker referred to former Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow as "Fast Andy Fastow," while another called him "the Betty Crocker of cooked books." 
Fastow is scheduled to appear before the House Energy and Commerce Committee Thursday, but is expected to invoke the Fifth Amendment. 
Also slated to appear is former Enron CEO Jeff Skilling, who is expected to testify Thursday. 
As congressional probes continue, lawmakers also want to hear from members of the Bush administration about its dealings with Enron executives. 
Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich, ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, on Tuesday called on White House political adviser Karl Rove to disclose his efforts securing an Enron job for Ralph Reed, the former executive director of the Christian Coalition. 
According to the White House, Rove recommended Reed to Enron for a job in 1997. Reed was hired by Enron in September, shortly after he resigned from the Christian Coalition. 
Bush, who was considering a presidential run at the time, wanted Reed to help him court conservative voters for the 2000 election. 
Reed, now chairman of the Georgia Republican Party, says he did not know of Rove's recommendation. 
Bush, meanwhile, rejected a suggestion from Capitol Hill that a special prosecutor be appointed for the Enron investigation under way at the Justice Department. 
"Listen, this is a business problem, and my Justice Department is going to investigate," Bush said. "And if there is wrongdoing, we'll hold them accountable for mistreatment of employees and shareholders." 
Lay and Enron have been major contributors to Bush campaigns, dating back to his first run for Texas governor. 
Chronicle reporters Laura Goldberg in Houston and David Ivanovich in Washington contributed to this story. 

COMPANIES & FINANCE THE ENRON COLLAPSE - Creditors' committee can quiz auditor - COURT RULING.
By ANDREW HILL.

Financial Times
(c) 2002 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved

Enron creditors were granted permission yesterday to demand paperwork from Andersen about its audit of the energy trader and the firm's involvement in the establishment of off-balance-sheet partnerships. 
A New York bankruptcy judge also said the official creditors' committee could quiz Andersen executives, including David Duncan, the lead partner involved in the Enron audit.
The committee, which acts on behalf of all Enron's creditors, sought the ruling last month after Andersen said it had destroyed Enron-related documents and sacked a number of employees, including Mr Duncan. 
The creditors said in a court filing that "a thorough examination" of Enron deals carried out prior to its bankruptcy filing in December was crucial to their attempt to discover Enron's true financial condition. 
The revelation that Andersen and Enron shredded documents has prompted other creditors to demand the appointment of an examiner at Enron, who would investigate allegations of wrongdoing at the company. Some have even asked for a court-appointed trustee to run the company. 
The publication of a damning internal report on Enron's deals with partnerships at the weekend could add to the pressure for such an appointment. But legal experts say the judge is unlikely to approve a trustee at this stage, as it would be disruptive. 
The Enron creditors' committee wants all documents relating to Andersen's audits from 1996 to 2000. The firm was fired as Enron's auditor last month. 
The committee will also seek documents about special purpose entities (SPEs) set up by Enron, including partnerships such as LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment run by Andrew Fastow, former chief financial officer, and Michael Kopper, another former Enron employee. 
The internal report concluded that a number of Enron deals with such partnerships were intended to flatter Enron's figures and enrich employees involved in running the SPEs.

COMPANIES & FINANCE THE ENRON COLLAPSE - Andersen chief urges change in accounting rules.
By PETER SPIEGEL.

COMPANIES & FINANCE THE ENRON COLLAPSE - Andersen chief urges change in accounting rules ENERGY TRADER'S FAILURE BERARDINO SAYS FIRM BARRED FROM RAISING ALARM - * DISCREPANCY OVER 401(k) PENSION PLAN ADVICE - * AUDITOR WEIGHS UP THE AFTER-SHOCKS. 
Joseph Berardino, Andersen chief executive, yesterday blamed the structure of the accounting industry for contributing to the collapse of Enron, saying that audit rules barred Andersen accountants from warning the public about the energy trader's financial condition.
Mr Berardino urged lawmakers to change accounting regulations to allow auditors to grade the quality and risk of a company's financial statements. Firms can give only a "pass" or "fail" to financial data submitted by a company. 
"Some companies do the bare minimum to meet (accounting) requirements, while others are much more prudent in their accounting decisions and disclosures," Mr Berardino told a hearing of the House financial services committee. 
"There are some companies that are pushing the envelope and investors don't know which one is which." 
The hearing was one of four held yesterday on Enron's collapse. The Senate commerce committee voted unanimously to subpoena Kenneth Lay, Enron's former chief executive, who pulled out of a hearing before the panel on Monday at the eleventh hour. Mr Lay is likely to be forced to appear on February 12, although senators said they expected him to invoke his Fifth Amendment right to silence. 
Michael Oxley, chairman of the House financial services committee, which was also to have heard from Mr Lay yesterday, also issued a subpoena, saying he would compel the former Enron chief to appear on February 14. 
In his testimony before the panel, Mr Berardino said his company repeatedly questioned Enron's accounting practices, pointing to a widely reported meeting of Andersen auditors in which some of Enron's practices were labelled "intelligent gambling". However, while accounting rules allowed auditors to raise their concerns with Enron's board - which Mr Berardino said they did regularly - they prevented any public disclosure unless there were clear violations of accepted accounting principles. 
"Our only option is to resign the engagement (but) resigning an engagement may destroy a company that is fundamentally sound," he said. "So those are our choices when faced with a client whose accounting treatments are risky: give it a pass or give it the death penalty." 
Mr Berardino's recommendations were largely ignored by committee investigators, who repeatedly questioned the Andersen chief on the auditor's role in Enron's questionable financial reporting. 
Mr Berardino declined to answer most of the questions, insisting he had no direct knowledge of how the Enron audit was conducted - a response that enraged some committee members. 
"You're captain of the ship," said Democrat Gary Ackerman. 
"If they came to you and said: we want to rob a bank and here's who's going to drive the getaway car, and this is what we're going to pay for the gun, you don't feel you have a duty to blow the whistle?" 
Mr Berardino said Andersen was aware of Enron's now infamous private partnerships, which enabled the company to take debts off its balance sheets, but insisted they were set up by Enron executives and investment bankers, with Andersen only giving passive judgments as to whether they passed accepted accounting principles. 
He added that Andersen would set up a new ethics office which would investigate questionable audit reviews when concerns were raised about the integrity or independence of an accountant.

Populist Pitch -- Without the Punch; Both Parties Claim Title, but Neither Makes Full-Scale Attack on Moneyed Interests
Juliet Eilperin
Washington Post Staff Writer

The Washington Post
FINAL

As the Enron scandal pumps new life into the old caricature of corporate executives as greedy and shady, politicians in both parties are stepping up efforts to claim the title "populist." 
"President Bush is a populist," Bush senior adviser Karl Rove declared last month. Other White House aides said the president's latest string of speeches had populist themes. House Democrats, meanwhile, have embraced "an economically populist, fiscally conservative, socially moderate message" this year, said their campaign group's executive director, Howard Wolfson.
But neither Bush's late-January swing through the South, nor a recent series of speeches by Democratic leaders, came close to the full-scale attack on moneyed interests that defines true populism. 
These rhetorical stabs acknowledged voters' anger over news that top executives made tens of millions of dollars while ordinary workers saw their jobs and retirement funds vanish. But they did not propose significant legal or regulatory changes that might rattle the nation's corporate hierarchy -- a structure that pours millions of dollars into Republican and Democratic coffers alike. 
"True economic populism, in the sense of William Jennings Bryan, would involve a direct attack on corporate America," said Claremont McKenna College political science professor Jack Pitney. "You're not hearing anything like [Bryan's 1896] 'Cross of Gold' speech." 
Populist themes reemerge periodically in American politics, from the Whiskey Rebellion to the Bull Moose movement to the presidential candidacies of Ross Perot and John McCain. Even the self-described centrist Bill Clinton espoused populist ideas in the 1992 election. He called for eliminating tax deductions "for excessive executive pay" and letting shareholders "determine the compensation of top executives." But little came of it all, and executive compensation packages skyrocketed in the 1990s. 
The latest populist boomlet is fueled mainly by revelations about Enron Corp., where one executive collected $353 million in stock proceeds while thousands of workers and shareholders lost huge sums. Enron's saga could prove politically troublesome for Bush, even if the scandal is never linked directly to the White House. Voters tell pollsters they associate Bush more closely with corporate influence than they do many other political figures. 
The president combats this potential problem not so much by offering populist changes in government as by returning to his folksy campaign rhetoric. In speeches in battleground states or GOP-leaning regions, he portrays himself as a fighter against Washington -- in other words, a populist, his aides say. 
"Thank goodness we cut taxes when we did," Bush told an applauding crowd in Winston-Salem, N.C., last Wednesday. "The best way to help an economy recover is to let hard-working people keep more of their money. When they get more money in their pocket, they spend more money, and as they spend more money, it helps create jobs." 
Bush pivoted to the opposition. "And for those who want to do away with tax relief -- you don't know what you're talking about," he said. "We've got to trust people with their own money. I'm not sure what textbook some of them are reading up there. But, obviously, it's not the same one we've been reading here in this room." 
Numerous Democrats, meanwhile, are claiming the populist label for themselves, hoping it will undercut high approval ratings for the president in particular, and for Republicans in general. 
"Enron reinforces, very dramatically, the image of the Republican Party as being too beholden to special interests," said Democratic pollster Mark Mellman. 
Reporting on a poll it conducted recently about the Enron collapse, Democracy Corps -- a group founded by Democratic consultants Stan Greenberg, James Carville and Robert Shrum -- urged Democrats to seize upon the Enron issue to contrast themselves with Republicans. "Enron has the potential to shape the entire political environment for 2002, impact other issues and reduce confidence in the Bush administration and Republicans," the report said. 
But the poll raises doubts about the political benefit Democrats might reap from the issue. Respondents agreed 57 percent to 34 percent with the statement, "What happened at Enron is indicative of a larger pattern of abuses by big corporations that have too much influence over what happens in Washington." But they agreed, 46 percent to 35 percent, that the Bush administration "is not part of the Enron mess." 
Pushing the populist refrain could reignite an old debate between Democratic progressives and centrists. Many remain divided over the wisdom of Vice President Al Gore's emphasis on populist themes in the 2000 election. At his convention speech, Gore promised voters he was "on your side" and vowed to protect "the people" over "the powerful." 
After the election, several influential Democrats concluded the strategy had backfired. "Economic populism as a message for Democrats has failed," pollster Mark Penn said in a recent interview. Penn has worked extensively for Clinton and the centrist Democratic Leadership Council. 
Liberals including Greenberg and union leaders disagreed. They said Gore's attack on entrenched interests gave him the biggest lead of his campaign. This advantage evaporated, they said, when subsequent campaign events made it harder for voters to distinguish between Gore and Bush. 
Such debates may explain why Florida Democrats have been cautious in tying Gov. Jeb Bush (R) to Enron. The president's brother recently attended a fundraiser at the home of a former Enron executive, despite Florida's pension plan losing $335 million in Enron stock. Jeb Bush's reelection campaign seems little troubled by the news. 
Even Greenberg said it is unreasonable to expect Democrats to take a hard-line populist stand. "I don't think either party centers their policies on going after corporations or going after CEOs," he said. 
Indeed, at the national level, Democrats are pushing the tamer goals of greater government oversight and more job creation. In his response to Bush's State of the Union speech, House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) called for tighter financial regulations, targeted tax cuts and fiscal restraint. 
That suits Simon Rosenberg, director of the centrist New Democrat Network, just fine. Gephardt's list, he said, amounts to "a repudiation of populism on its face. . . . The mainstream economic view is winning out in the Democratic Party." 
The mainstream view allows for modestly populist-sounding goals. Democrats, for example, continue to challenge the House GOP's decision to provide tax breaks in its economic stimulus plan for corporations such as Enron. 
"Democrats in the House have a unique opportunity to take on the Washington special interests," said Jenny Backus, spokeswoman for the Democrats' House campaign committee.

ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: A CASE STUDY
Enron Is Grist for Business School Courses
By SANA SIWOLOP

02/06/2002
The New York Times
Page 8, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

Business school professors across the country say they are latching onto the Enron scandal as a way to make courses on everything from Accounting 101 to crisis management come alive. 
Some teachers are treading cautiously, partly because business-school case studies usually focus on historical events, not unfolding dramas, and partly because the Enron collapse is so complicated.
But the revelations about the maneuverings of Enron Corporation executives and the actions of the company's auditor, Arthur Andersen, are too tempting to pass up, professors say. 
Roger D. Martin, an assistant accounting professor at the business school at Indiana University, says he introduced a graduate accounting class on the company early in November, when Enron had to restate its earnings and ''things started smoking.'' 
Professor Martin said he planned to use Enron's financial meltdown for years to come as a case study in his advanced accounting class. ''This is a classic case in almost everything related to accounting,'' he said. ''If anything, it might make it tough to keep the conversation going in just one direction because there are so many angles.'' 
Other business school professors say they are eager to use Enron to enliven business cases that too often focus on old examples like the Ford Pinto gas tank of the 1970's. ''Students now are largely unimpressed if something is more than four to five years old,'' said Al Hartgraves, an accounting professor at the Goizueta Business School at Emory University in Atlanta. 
Before his students left for their Christmas break in the second week of December, Professor Hartgraves promised to e-mail them a summary of the company's situation, and did so at the end of the month. Then a couple of weeks ago, he created a computer bulletin board about Enron over the internal e-mail system that connects roughly 1,000 Emory business students. Within 24 hours, he said, more than 100 students had asked him for bulletin board access. 
''We've seen audit failures before with companies like Waste Management and Sunbeam,'' Professor Hartgraves said, ''but never anything as big as this.'' 
At Brandeis University in Waltham, Mass., Alfonso F. Canella, an adjunct professor who teaches a class in financial modeling, said he planned to use Enron to illustrate the mechanics, as well as the riskiness, of putting together limited partnerships, especially when the deals were not listed on a company's balance sheet. 
Not everyone is convinced that Enron's troubles belong in every classroom. Jan Barton, an assistant accounting professor at Emory, thinks that it is appropriate to use Enron in an introductory course on financial statement analysis, but that its accounting and energy-trading practices may be too complicated for most students. 
Even when it comes to teaching more advanced students, Professor Barton said, he preferred to focus on companies like Dell Computer, Sears Roebuck, Wal-Mart and Microsoft, whose financial statement practices and products are easier to understand. 
''I don't want to talk about a company that operates in a funky industry, like utilities, and whose transactions involved things like financial derivative contracts,'' Mr. Barton said. 
Still, Diana C. Robertson, an associate professor of organization and management at Goizueta, in time concluded that the Enron case could not be ignored. 
In December, she decided to stick to well-documented cases like the antitrust charges against Microsoft and Nike's foreign labor practices for her business ethics classes. But as Enron unraveled, she decided that using a business story in the making, rather than one that is years or decades old, was too ''wonderful'' to pass up. 
Raymond D. Horton, chairman of the Columbia University Business School's management division, said he would allocate plenty of time to the subject this winter in his course on the modern political economy. ''We're all itching to discuss it,'' he said, pointing to a pile of Enron news clippings on his desk. 
Robert Rupe, a second-year finance student at Columbia, said one lecture for a course on corporate turnarounds he just signed up for is titled simply ''Enron.'' 
A useful point in the Enron case, business professors say, is the light it sheds on the evolution of the American corporation into unexpected forms. For example, Anne Carter, an economics professor at Brandeis, says it helps illuminate the nature of the modern corporation, which often bears little resemblance to the ''mythical'' manufacturing and farming companies that appear in many textbooks. For one thing, she said, Enron is a good way to show students just how much of an imbalance there is in the information investors typically receive, and how a company can exploit that imbalance. 
Professor Carter plans to devote three classes to Enron this semester in an undergraduate course she teaches. ''I really think that Enron shows students that the market now is very different from the market that was shaped by Adam Smith's invisible hand,'' she said.

REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)
Lerach's Enron Gambit

As with any dead carcass, Enron is attracting downstream scavengers. Of course this includes the lawyers, especially lawsuit king Bill Lerach, who recently posed before TV cameras in Houston with a carton of what he claimed were shredded Enron documents. But before he cashes in one more time, Mr. Lerach's own legal practices deserve some greater public scrutiny. 
For example, a Los Angeles grand jury is investigating whether the Lerach law firm -- Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach -- paid plaintiffs to sign onto class-action lawsuits. There's also the recent decision by a federal judge to give the lead counsel slot in a class-action suit to a lower-cost law firm; the judge said that Milberg's stiff fees would have gobbled up too much of any money its clients might recover. Milberg's appeal on the latter will be heard by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on February 15.
This all deserves more attention than it's received because Mr. Lerach is not just any old tort warrior. The Milberg firm accounts for the lion's share of all federal shareholders' suits, and in California Mr. Lerach is approaching Bill Gates levels of market share. 
With Enron's failure, a movement is also afoot to make tort lawyers the big beneficiaries. They're mobilizing to repeal a modest 1995 tort reform bill that reined in the worst of the tort bar's securities lawsuits. Mr. Lerach is himself now posing as a defender of Enron shareholders, and he's even been retained by Calpers, the big public pension fund that had invested in Enron partnerships. Mark this down as wildebeest hiring hyenas as bodyguards. 
The Lerach methods have been challenged before. Three years ago he lost big when the firm paid out $50 million to settle an abuse-of-process lawsuit brought against it by a Chicago-based consulting firm. According to California press reports, today's grand jury investigation revolves around a Beverly Hills eye surgeon who is in prison for fraud and who has appeared as a plaintiff in a number of suits filed by Milberg. It certainly wouldn't be kosher for a law firm to induce "victims" into filing contingency-fee claims. 
Mr. Lerach's standard defense is that his rough methods are the only way to make big business accountable. But that's just what makes the issue of Milberg's attorneys fees now headed for the Ninth Circuit so juicy. No one in this case is denying anyone her day in court. All the ruling by U.S. District Court Judge Vaughn Walker did was ensure that if the plaintiffs win, they won't have to turn nearly all of their winnings over to the Milberg plutocrats. 
The story begins, as many Milberg stories do, with a drop in the share price of a company, in this case Copper Mountain Networks. Milberg quickly moved in. But Milberg's wasn't the only suit, so when it came time to choose a lead counsel, Judge Walker asked for rival bids. When he looked at the price sheets he found that another firm's lower fees served the interests of the shareholders better than Milberg's hefty ones. 
This judgment is startling, because when it comes to fees lawyers nearly always stick together. But recent fees have become so obscene (in the case of tobacco and asbestos into the billions of dollars) that they may have opened up a new political and legal vulnerability for the tort bar. 
Lawyers love to shout "price controls" when anyone talks about their fees, but lawyers aren't normal businessmen. As Judge Walker noted in his opinion, lawyers are not independent contractors but are "fiduciaries for absent class members." They are officers of the court. This is the same understanding embodied in the American Bar Association's Model Rules of Professional Conduct, which forbids "unreasonable" fees on precisely these grounds. 
That understanding is even more critical in class actions, because the client being represented is absent and thus has no real voice. While in a normal case the client contracts with a lawyer, in class actions the lawyer essentially conscripts the clients. Then if the lawyer wins or settles the case, he takes the bulk of the winnings as fees, often leaving a pittance for the actual plaintiffs. "I have the greatest practice of law in the world," Mr. Lerach once quipped to a group of corporate directors. "I have no clients." 
But it is about time he got some adult legal supervision. The tort bar has become so rich, increasingly at the expense of its own clients, that its abuses need to be reined in for the good of the broader society. All the more so now that it is lining up to ravage Enron one more time.

Questioning the Books: Panel, in Enron's Wake, to Review Lawsuit Curbs
By Robert S. Greenberger
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

WASHINGTON -- As federal investigators and Congress expand their probe into the collapse of Enron Corp., lawmakers want to revisit a 1995 law limiting lawsuits that will make it difficult for company shareholders to recoup their losses. 
The Senate Judiciary Committee today will hear testimony on the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act and how its provisions shielding corporate advisers from shareholder lawsuits could block Enron employees and shareholders from suing the accountants and lawyers who helped create the complicated partnerships that contributed to the giant energy trader's demise.
The law does nothing to inhibit the government from taking civil and criminal action against Enron, its lawyers and accountants. 
Enron, once the seventh-largest company in the U.S. by revenues, saw its share price implode last fall amid allegations of questionable accounting and overstated earnings, and was forced to seek bankruptcy-court protection. Its employees, whose retirement savings accounts were tied to company stock, and outside shareholders saw their investments evaporate. 
The bill was part of the Republican Party's "Contract with America," a platform of 10 bills aimed at overhauling government programs and the legal system that the GOP used to win control of the House in the 1994 elections. The securities-litigation bill was intended to curb a rash of lawsuits filed by shareholders angry over company performance, particularly in the volatile high-technology industry. It had the strong backing of the accountants and high-tech executives who saw themselves increasingly vulnerable to frivolous class-action suits. 
The committee will probe how the law tightens rules on bringing complaints that initiate lawsuits and how it protects accountants and other professionals from exposure to complete liability for corporate losses and from lawsuits seeking triple damages. Overall, the law partly shields the accountants, lawyers, bankers and other outsiders to whom victims might turn for redress from wrongs by a company in bankruptcy court. 
"By forcing through special exemptions for securities, Congress has contributed to the `Wild West' mentality reflected in Enron's hidden partnerships," said the judiciary panel's chairman, Sen. Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.). Should legislation to change the 1995 law come out of the hearings, however, it is unclear if it would be made retroactive and aid Enron shareholders. 
Steven Schatz, a California attorney who was selected as a witness by Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, the committee's ranking Republican, rejects the notion that the law makes it difficult for plaintiffs to bring legitimate lawsuits. Overall, it has a positive effect, he said, because "it has caused the plaintiffs' bar to be more circumspect with regard to whom they sue." 
One example is that the 1995 law requires that a complaint in a securities-fraud case must present details "giving rise to a strong inference" of fraud. Previously, the complaint didn't have to be as detailed. 
Meanwhile, the rules have also been changed to bar the beginning of discovery until after a court has decided whether to allow the case to go forward. Previously, plaintiffs attorneys could begin to gather documents and interview witnesses when the complaint was filed. 
Columbia University law professor Jack Coffee said that taken together, the two rules are a Catch-22: "You can't get discovery unless you have strong evidence of fraud, and you can't get strong evidence of fraud without discovery." 
The statute also substitutes proportionate liability for the old law under which everyone involved in the financial scheme would be fully liable for all the damages involved. So, in most circumstances under the new law, the amount for which an accounting or law firm could be held liable would be only a fraction of the 100% for which it might previously have been sued. This could be crucial for plaintiffs when a defendant company, such as Enron, is in bankruptcy court. 
Finally, it limits the use of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, in civil suits involving securities. The RICO law was very unpopular with corporate defense attorneys, because among other provisions it permits an award to plaintiffs of triple damages. 
Although the examination of the 1995 law involves such arcane legal issues, it is fueled by politics. Democrats are eager to pin the Enron debacle on pro-business Republicans. Consumer groups also are weighing in. 
The Consumer Federation of America, Consumers Union and U.S. Public Interest Research Group are among the groups pointing to a Dec. 12, 1995, letter they wrote lawmakers opposing the bill. "This legislation will protect financial swindlers from being held accountable to their victims," the letter said.

FRONT PAGE - FIRST SECTION - Post-Enron equity fears fuel 'flight from risk'.

FRONT PAGE - FIRST SECTION - Post-Enron equity fears fuel 'flight from risk' WORRIED INVESTORS IN EUROPEAN AND US MARKETS SHUN STOCKS THAT FACE ACCOUNTING OR FINANCIAL CONCERNS. 
Equity markets in Europe and the US witnessed a "flight from risk" yesterday, with investors shunning any stocks that faced accounting or financial concerns.
Worries about the quality of corporate accounts in the wake of the collapse of Enron were accompanied by fears that heavily indebted companies would either collapse or be forced to raise large amounts of equity to restore their balance sheets. 
Investor concern was demonstrated when General Electric, the world's largest company, had to dismiss questions about the transparency of its accounting by reaffirming its earnings growth targets. Jeff Immelt, chairman and chief executive, said: "We have tremendous financial strength and a system of controllership that is second to none." GE shares recovered 3.5 per cent to close at $36.21 yesterday. 
European companies came under the spotlight. UK-based electronics group Invensys was one of the biggest casualties, its shares falling 8 1/2p, or 8 per cent, to 97 1/2p, the worst performance in the FTSE 100 index. 
Credit Suisse First Boston reduced its earnings forecasts for the company and said: "Market feedback on Invensys remains very discouraging." Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein warned of the possibility of a rights issue to reduce the company's debt. 
Elan, the Irish pharmaceutical company, whose accounts have come under intense scrutiny, saw its share price fall a further Euros 3.5, or 18 per cent, to Euros 16 in the wake of Monday's profits warning. 
Shares in Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest bank, fell Euros 2.8, or 4 per cent, to Euros 67 on concern that corporate financial problems would prompt a rise in its bad debt provisions. 
European markets were pushed lower by the concerns and by Wall Street losses on Monday. In London, the FTSE 100 index fell 73.9, or 1.4 per cent, to 5,093.4. 
In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 1.66 at 9685.43. Tyco International shares continued to tumble after the beleaguered conglomerate on Monday drew down its credit lines, triggering a downgrade by Standard & Poor's, the credit rating agency. Even though Tyco's move has removed any short-term questions about its stability, the shares closed down more than 22 per cent at $23.10. 
Tyco has lost almost half its value since announcing plans for a four-way break-up. 
Companies adjusting earnings continued to suffer - even if reporting profits not previously disclosed. Reliant Resources shares fell fell more than 13 per cent to close at $11.95 yesterday after the energy group said it would restate second-and third-quarter earnings to show additional profits of $100m ( #70m) and $130m ( #90m) respectively. 
The Enron fall-out has made investors far more cautious about the quality of corporate profits, particularly in the US, where accounting standards had been assumed to be the best in the world.

Barbie Loves Math

WASHINGTON -- Hollywood is trying to figure out how to turn Enron into a TV movie. 
How do they take all the stuff about ''the contingent nature of existing restricted forward contracts'' and ''share-settled costless collar arrangements,'' jettison it like the math in ''A Beautiful Mind,'' and juice it up?
Enron is such a mind-numbing black hole, even for financial analysts, that if you tried to explain all the perfidious permutations, you'd never come out the other end. 
A movie executive asked Lowell Bergman, the former ''60 Minutes'' producer who is now an investigative reporter for The Times and ''Frontline,'' for the most cinematic way to frame the story. (Mr. Bergman had the ultimate Hollywood experience of being played by Al Pacino in another corporate greed-and-corruption saga, ''The Insider.'') 
''It's about the women up against the men,'' he replied. 
Before you know it, Enron will be Erined, as in Brockovich. Texas good ol' girl, fast-talking, salt-of-the-earth whistle-blower Sherron Watkins will be Renee Zellweger in a Shoshanna Lonstein bustier. The adorable and intrepid Fortune reporter Bethany McLean, the first journalist to sound an alarm about Enron's accounting practices, will be look-alike Alicia Silverstone. And Loretta Lynch, the tough California utilities czarina and Yale-trained litigator who questioned a year ago what Enron did that was of any value to consumers, will be look-nothing-alike Angelina Jolie, sporting power plant tattoos. 
''From the beginning of the California energy meltdown, women were not afraid to point a finger at the seventh-largest corporation in the U.S. and say 'You can't do this,' '' Mr. Bergman told me. ''And the electric cowboys at Enron, where the culture had a take-no-prisoners, get-rid-of-any-regulation, macho perspective on the marketplace, was aggressive when it came to shutting them up.'' 
As a Texas writer says: ''This was Jeff Skilling's club and there weren't a lot of women in his club.'' 
At first, the slicked-back Gordon Gekko C.E.O. and his arrogant coterie in the Houston skyscraper -- where men were wont to mess around and leave wives for secretaries -- dismissed female critics. 
Some privately trashed Ms. Lynch as ''an idiot'' and coveted Ms. McLean, calling her ''a looker who doesn't know anything.'' But when they realized the women were on to them, the company that intimidated competitors, suppliers and utilities tried to oust Ms. Lynch from her job and discredit Ms. McLean and kill her article. 
When Ms. Watkins confronted Kenneth Lay with her fears last August, he knew the cat was spilling out of the beans, as Carmen Miranda used to say. Within two months he had to 'fess up to $600 million in spurious profits. 
(In Houston's testosterone-fueled energy circles, many men watched Linda Lay crying on TV and muttered that in Texas, there is nothing lower than sending your wife out to fight your battle.) 
As a feminine fillip, there's Maureen Castaneda, a former Enron executive who revealed the shredding shindigs there. Ms. Castaneda realized something was wrong when she took some shreds home to use as packing material and saw they were marked with the galactic names Chewco and Jedi, which turned out to be quasi-legal partnerships. 
Only 10 years after Mattel put out Teen Talk Barbie whining ''Math class is tough,'' we have women unearthing the Rosetta stone of this indecipherable scandal. 
What does this gender schism mean? That men care more about inflating their assets? That women are more caring about colleagues getting shafted? 
It is men's worst fear, personally and professionally, that women will pin the sin on them, come ''out of the night like a missile and destroy a man,'' as Alan Simpson said during the Hill-Thomas hearings. 
There has been speculation that women are more likely to be whistleblowers -- or tattletales when they are little -- because they are less likely to be members of the club. 
Some men suggest that women, with their vast experience with male blarney, are experts at calling guys on it. 
At Enron, it was men who came up with complex scams showing there was no limit to the question ''How much is enough?'' And it was women who raised the simple question, ''Why?''
