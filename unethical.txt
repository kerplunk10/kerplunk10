Here's the scoop on people doing unethical broker trades:

 

Frank and Matt are the only others that have done Socal broker trades since 09/01 (I quereied from 09/01 to current).  As for Janie, she hasn't done any Socal brokered deals since July, but she has done a few at other points.

Sorry if you were hoping for more, but this is it... from Sept.1 to Oct. 11.

I'll be in Kansas on Fri.

How Would You Like to......
1. Drastically Reduce Personal, Business and Capital gains taxes?
2. Create a six figure income every 4 months?
3. Legally make yourself and your assets completely judgment-proof,
seizure-proof, lien-proof, divorce-proof, attorney-proof, IRS-proof, 
and become completely insulated?
TAKE A SERIOUS LOOK AT YOUR LIFE.....
Do you think you are paid what you are worth? 
Will you be set to retire in the next few years? 
Do you control the course of your day, or does someone watch over you?
The fact is we have many people in our enterprise that earn over 50k per
month from the privacy of their own homes, and are retiring in 2-3 years(wealthy)
and having total freedom-both personal and financial.
Many have been conditioned to believe it must be illegal, immoral or unethical 
to ever earn any real profits from our efforts. The sad truth
is,it's been designed that way by the ultra-rich and ultra powerful since
before any of us were born.If you are interested in radically changing your financial
and personal future,
I invite you to call:

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I believe it is your duty to to donate the millions of dollars you made from Enron stock before the bankruptcy to funds that assist former Enron employees who were so badly hit from this financial fiasco, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH. These funds also provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.

It is now known that you personally gained $100 million off of Enron stock, while many Enron employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy.  Enron also profited from the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, thousands of consumers are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the employees to buy it.  You must know, in your heart, that this is truly unfair, unjust and unethical.  But there is something you can do to help make things right: please donate this money to funds set up to help repair the lives of Americans hurt by Enron's misdeeds.  I think it's the least you can do.

Thanks for your time.

Sincerely,

Keri Lynch

Body:
I am one of Annat Jain,s girlfriends.  I need to bring some stark facts to
your attention.  Annat Jain, a senior director of communications at Enron
India, boldly and shamelessly continues to set an example of &Ethical
misconduct8 and is risking the integrity of your organization in India as a
whole.  This has been going on for the last 18 months!  While staying on
Enron,s payroll, he boldly demonstrates conflict of interest by spending
most of his time at his other private ventures (RazorFinish.com and
Powervertical.com).

Since apparently he enjoys the CEO,s friendship, he feels that he can walk
over anyone at anytime.  He is very abusive right from the office boy to the
senior staff and openly boasts about his arrogance and attitude.  Respect
towards others does not even cross his arrogant and rude self.  If one
audits the last 18 months of credit card charges, purchases and other
expenses, most of these charges are being made for his 2 private ventures
(RazorFinish.com and Powervertical.com) or personal entertainment.

To go totally overboard with his bold denial of ethics and company
standards, he is now in the process of hiring and acquiring some individuals
from his 2nd venture (Powervertical.com) into Enron!  He also boasts openly
that Enron India will soon acquire his company Powervertical.com so he can
gain financially from such a transaction.  Thus, he continues to use Enron
as a platform for his personal gains.  It is indeed a shame that such an
individual represents your organization in the marketplace and industry.  A
lot of the industry experts are aware of Annat,s unethical behavior and his
rude attitude in general dealings and have refused to work with Enron as
such.  What example will he set for the organization as a whole and how long
will you tolerate such behavior?

Dear Sir or Madam :
	Enron Corp. ("Enron") believes in conducting its business affairs in accordance with the highest ethical standards. As outlined in Enron's Code of Ethics, employees of Enron and its subsidiaries are required to comply with Enron's Business Ethics Policy which requires an employee to conduct himself/herself in a manner which is not detrimental to the best interests of Enron and which does not bring to the employee financial gain separately derived as a direct consequence of his/her employment with Enron. Further, Enron's Business Ethics Policy states that no lavish entertainment or gifts are to be given or received by Enron employees for special position, price, or privilege.
 	Not only is it incumbent upon our employees to follow this policy, but your cooperation in respecting these standards is also critical. Enron expects each of its vendors and contractors to maintain adequate records that document its work relationship with Enron. Enron's auditing department will routinely conduct business ethics compliance audits of certain vendors and contractors with whom Enron does business. Your recognition of our ethical standards allows Enron employees to work with you via arm's length transactions and avoids potentially embarrassing and unethical situations. If you ever become aware of variances from our policy, please advise:

 
	Your business relationship is important to us, and we look forward to maintaining that relationship with you.
Very truly yours,

Let's get right to the point.

I am looking for positive motivated people that
want and need to increase their income by 10k per month.

Do you have a burning desire to change the quality
of your existing life?

Would you like to live the life that others only dream about?

If you think this is too good to be true or are skeptical
then this may not be for you... Many have been conditioned
to believe it must be illegal, immoral or unethical to ever
earn any real profits from their efforts.

The fact is we have many people in our enterprise who earn
over 50k per month from the privacy of their own home and
are retiring in 2-3 years obviously wealthy and having total
freedom both personal and financial.

How would you like to:
1. Drastically reduce personal, business and capitol gains taxes?
2. Protect all assets from any form of seizure, liens, or judgments?
3. Create a six figure income every 4 months?
How about:
1. Restoring and preserving complete personal and financial privacy?
2. Create and amass personal wealth, multiply it and protect it?
3. Realize a 3 to 6 times greater returns on your money?
4. Legally make yourself and your assets completely judgment-proof,
seizure-proof, lien-proof, divorce-proof, attorney-proof, IRS-proof,
and become completely insulated?

Are you a BIG thinker, BIG dreamer and a person that believes they
deserve to have the best in life?

Are you capable of recognizing that once in a lifetime opportunity
when it's looking right at you?

Countless others have missed their shot at the title only to look back
years later and wished they should've because they could've.

Body:
John,

Let me begin by recognizing that you are now entrusted to resolve issues that were not of your own creation.  I also appreciate the tremendous amount of stress that you have been under especially considering the birth of your second child.  I do not envy you now, yet I am sincerely grateful that it is you and Greg leading us through these times.

The message that you have sent throughout my six years with Enron has been "trust the system until it fails you".  We would all be disappointed if our troubled times were a result of a few (rather large) ill-conceived investments, but the violation of trust comes from the deliberate misrepresentation of facts.  Namely the restatement of earnings and balance sheet items back to 1997.  We have all based our decisions to continue employment with Enron upon publicly available information.  Has fraudulence been proven in a court of law?  No.  However, the court of public opinion has already had it its trial, the perpetrators have been convicted and the victims now await retribution.  In this matter, the corporation is responsible to the court of public opinions jurisdiction.  I write you now to offer my version of justice.

From 1997 to date I have received restricted stock and options with a notional value of approximately $700,000 (by memory).  At the end of each compensation period, I based my decision to continue my employment with Enron on all publicly available information.  This corporation has deliberately and knowingly misrepresented these facts.  Today, I call on Enron to repurchase my entire equity portfolio and replace it with a one time lump sum payment equal to the exact notional value.

My situation is certainly unique.  I can save you the effort and inform you that my net career to date contribution is $zero.  To this I have three responses: (1)  At no time did I falter from the highest ethical standard, whereas Enron has; (2) I am calling for Enron to address its misrepresentations made prior to my 2001 misfortune.  It would be an injustice for Enron to use my 2001 performance to justify its prior unethical compensation program; and (3) I am fully prepared to accept zero performance bonus for this year. 

Enron may not be able to offer this solution to all of its employees.  You may need to make decisions on who to keep.  Perhaps Enron should offer to release those less desired individuals from any contractual obligations.

John, I recognize that these issues cannot be resolved over night.  I will be as patient as I can be.

Sincerely,
Keith

John,

Let me begin by recognizing that you are now entrusted to resolve issues that were not of your own creation.  I also appreciate the tremendous amount of stress that you have been under especially considering the birth of your second child.  I do not envy you now, yet I am sincerely grateful that it is you and Greg leading us through these times.

The message that you have sent throughout my six years with Enron has been "trust the system until it fails you".  We would all be disappointed if our troubled times were a result of a few (rather large) ill-conceived investments, but the violation of trust comes from the deliberate misrepresentation of facts.  Namely the restatement of earnings and balance sheet items back to 1997.  We have all based our decisions to continue employment with Enron upon publicly available information.  Has fraudulence been proven in a court of law?  No.  However, the court of public opinion has already had it its trial, the perpetrators have been convicted and the victims now await retribution.  In this matter, the corporation is responsible to the court of public opinions jurisdiction.  I write you now to offer my version of justice.

From 1997 to date I have received restricted stock and options with a notional value of approximately $700,000 (by memory).  At the end of each compensation period, I based my decision to continue my employment with Enron on all publicly available information.  This corporation has deliberately and knowingly misrepresented these facts.  Today, I call on Enron to repurchase my entire equity portfolio and replace it with a one time lump sum payment equal to the exact notional value.

My situation is certainly unique.  I can save you the effort and inform you that my net career to date contribution is $zero.  To this I have four responses: (1)  At no time did I falter from the highest ethical standard, whereas Enron has; (2) I am calling for Enron to address its misrepresentations made prior to my 2001 misfortune.  It would be an injustice for Enron to use my 2001 performance to justify its prior unethical compensation program; (3) I am fully prepared to accept zero performance bonus for this year; and (4) Despite my expectation of zero bonus I have continued to work diligently (including nights and weekends at your suggestion) at rebuilding this team.

Enron may not be able to offer this solution to all of its employees.  You may need to make decisions on who to keep.  Perhaps Enron should offer to release those less desired individuals from any contractual obligations.

John, I recognize that these issues cannot be resolved over night.  I will be as patient as I can be.

Sincerely,
Keith

Calif Probe Focuses On Dynegy,Mirant Plants-Commissioners     
Updated: Monday, May 21, 2001 05:28 PM;ET     ; 
;
By Jason Leopold and Mark Golden 

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--California officials are focusing an investigation 
into the state's wholesale electricity markets on two power plants operated 
by two of the state's largest merchant power companies, Mirant Corp. (MIR, 
news, msgs) and a joint venture between Dynegy Inc. (DYN, news, msgs) and NRG 
Energy (NRG, news, msgs), according to two commissioners on the California 
Public Utilities Commission. 

The CPUC and the state Attorney General are investigating whether output was 
withheld in order to maintain high prices over the past seven months at 
Mirant's Pittsburg plant in northern California and the Encina power plant, 
which is equally owned by Dynegy and NRG, near San Diego. 

All power plants in the state are being examined, but investigators have 
found that the Encina and Pittsburg plants have reduced power during supply 
shortages, causing market prices to rise. 

But so far, the commissioners said, investigators have found no activity that 
is clearly illegal. 

"Is it unethical? Yes," one PUC commissioner said. "But is it illegal? No, 
unless there was collusion. This is the system we set up. What the generators 
are doing would be the appropriate thing to do if you are going to maximize 
your profit to shareholders." 

Spokesmen for Mirant and Dynegy flatly denied the charges. 

"What we did was both legal and ethical," said Mirant spokesman Chuck 
Griffin. "There was a very forthright attempt to keep these plants up and 
running. Unequivocally, we have never held anything back." 

Some of the turbines at the Encina plant are peaking units, which are 
supposed to ramp up and down to meet demand, Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengell 
said. The plant is operated by NRG, but Dynegy markets the power from the 
plant and tells NRG how much power to generate based on what has been sold. 

"We've done absolutely nothing to manipulate prices," Stengell said. 
"Electricity demand increases and decreases throughout the day. Our 
production increases and decreases to follow changing demand. Ultimately, the 
ISO determines the exact amount of dispatch." 

A spokesman for Attorney General William Lockyer declined to comment on the 
ongoing investigation. 

CPUC President Loretta Lynch told California newspapers last week that her 
office and that of Lockyer's have enough information to take legal action 
against generators next month, though she declined to name the companies 
involved and she said that the exact nature of the legal action is still 
under review. 

"We get really tired of these assertions with no evidence to back them up," 
Griffin said. "This whole idea that any generation was held back at any time 
is completely bogus. It is pure political rhetoric." 

Mirant's California power plants have run at full power during critical times 
except under one of two conditions, Griffin said. Either generating units 
were broken and had to be taken off line to be fixed, or they were beginning 
to run in a way that violated environmental restrictions and Mirant had to 
get permission to run at full power any longer. 

"There are no other reasons than those two," said Griffin. 

Nevertheless, several employees at the power plants involved have testified 
that generating units were ramped down even when the state's Independent 
System Operator had warned of tight supplies, according to one commissioner. 

And a senior NRG employee at the Encina power plant in Carlsbad told Dow 
Jones Newswires that he was told by Dynegy's Houston trading floor to "ramp 
down" the large 951-megawatt plant on at least 10 occasions when he knew 
power supplies were tight. 

"We would be told to ramp down the units even when we knew the state needed 
the megawatts," the employee said. "Then the spot price would go up, but we 
didn't really pay too much attention to that, because as far as we know 
everybody was doing this. We knew how much power other plants were operating 
at, and we knew they weren't at full capacity." 

NRG spokeswoman Meredith Moore said that the ISO gives instructions to Dynegy 
and Dynegy tells NRG what to do. "And there have been conditions when the ISO 
told us to ramp down during Stage 2 emergencies," Moore said. 

Also, one CPUC commissioner pointed out that the state's deregulation law 
doesn't require owners of power plants to bid all of their capacity into the 
market. 

The state's incumbent utilities, who were forced to sell their power plants 
as part of deregulation, also may have contributed to the problem, according 
to an ISO study. By not securing nearly enough power in advance to meet their 
customers projected needs, the state's three main utilities contributed to 36 
Stage 1 and 2 power emergencies last summer and forced the grid operator to 
pay a much higher price to keep the lights on. 

The utilities argued that they underscheduled their load so they wouldn't 
have to pay the generators' high bid prices. The ISO market last year had a 
price cap, while other markets did not. 

Mirant's Griffin, meanwhile, said all the finger pointing isn't solving the 
state's problem. 

"If they are going to get to a solution in California, they have to get 
beyond silly political rhetoric," Griffin said. "The real solution to the 
problem is to get new supply, and if they are going to do that they have to 
make this market look attractive to the kind of people who can build power 
plants."

FYI.  This is THE story out here today.  Given the repugnant things that 
Maviglio has said about Enron over the past several months, it will be very 
interesting to see whether he'll be able to withstand the fact that all the 
time that he was saying those things, he owned our stock.  Gee, couldn't 
happen to a nicer guy.

Best,
Jeff

In addition, all this buzz about conflicts with traders and Calpine could put 
in jeopardy the state's contracts with Calpine, which may, in the end, be a 
very good thing for Direct Access.
Davis spokesman under fire for stock 
By Amy Chance and Dale Kasler
Bee Staff Writers
(Published July 31, 2001) 
Davis administration spokesman Steve Maviglio acknowledged Monday that he 
bought stock in Calpine Corp. in June, at a time when the company was 
announcing a breakthrough in its bid to build a controversial San Jose power 
plant. 
His disclosure came several days after Gov. Gray Davis dismissed five state 
power purchasers for owning stock in the company and drew new complaints that 
Davis administration officials may have improperly mixed their private 
finances and their public roles. 
Maviglio, now acting as interim communications director for the 
administration, said he put in an "open" order for Calpine stock May 31, 
agreeing to buy 300 shares once the stock hit a certain price. 
He said that threshold was met June 20, the day after an action by the 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission brought down "all energy stock prices 
across the board." 
Maviglio said he bought the stock for his individual retirement account, and 
it has since declined in value. Under terms of the open order, he said, he 
had no control over the exact date of purchase. 
Maviglio touted the company in his role as spokesman to the governor in a 
story published June 27 in The Bee. He said Monday that he was simply 
responding to a reporter's question about the company's positive reputation. 
"They have made a clear commitment to invest in California's future," 
Maviglio said at the time. "Their pricing has been far more reasonable than 
any other generator." 
In the interview, Maviglio also contrasted Calpine and Texas-based 
generators. He said Calpine "took a different tack from the Joe Bobs of the 
world," an apparent reference to Joe Bob Perkins, a senior executive with 
Reliant Energy Inc. of Houston. 
Maviglio acknowledged the stock ownership several days after the 
administration ended its relationship with several energy consultants who 
held stock in energy companies, including Calpine. 
Under pressure from Secretary of State Bill Jones, a Republican who hopes to 
challenge Davis for governor next year, the Davis administration has spent 
several weeks scrambling to answer questions about the stock holdings and 
potential conflicts of its consultants and energy traders. 
Jones said Monday that Maviglio should be fired. 
"These actions are unethical, unconscionable, unacceptable, and heads should 
roll," he said in a statement. He said the Democratic governor should direct 
all of his staff to immediately file updated conflict-of-interest statements 
to reflect current holdings. 
Jones, who last week asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to 
investigate administration consultants for insider trading, also said the 
probe should be expanded "to include all of the governor's staff." 
Federal law and SEC regulations forbid anyone from trading stocks while 
possessing "insider information" -- relevant facts not available to the 
public, according to the SEC. Violations can bring lawsuits and criminal 
prosecution. 
Michael Prozan, a Menlo Park lawyer and expert on insider trading, said the 
prohibition against it originally focused on halting company executives from 
profiting from news before it was disclosed publicly. 
But the laws have been broadened to include others besides company employees. 
Investment bankers, lawyers and journalists have been snared by 
insider-trading crackdowns. 
Davis' office was instrumental earlier this year in paving the way for 
removing barriers to construction of a Calpine plant in San Jose. On May 30, 
after opposing the project for years, San Jose Mayor Ron Gonzales announced 
he had negotiated an agreement addressing his concerns and agreed to support 
construction. 
His action came after Davis in April endorsed the plant's construction and as 
the state Energy Commission threatened to approve it over local objections. 
On June 20, the company announced it had won tentative state approval to 
build the plant. 
Maviglio said he buys many stocks and that Enron Corp. and Calpine are the 
only energy generators among them. He owns 100 shares of Enron stock, which 
he purchased in 1996. 
"I deal with hundreds of California companies just about every day, and this 
was one that I saw that looked like a good investment based on public 
knowledge," he said. "I read six newspapers a day or more, and I know what's 
going on in the world. If there's a standard that I can't invest in something 
that I have general public knowledge of, then I wouldn't have any stocks at 
all." 
Maviglio said that the "open" order he placed meant that he could not have 
used inside information to make his stock purchase. 
"Had I had specific knowledge about a contract being signed or what actually 
happened in the office of the mayor of San Jose ... that would have been 
unrelated," Maviglio said. "There was no timing-based sequence to it." 
Calpine stock, despite the company's considerable success, has slipped in 
recent weeks because of general investor anxiety about the California energy 
crisis. 
The stock, which trades on the New York Stock Exchange, closed at $49.30 on 
May 31, the day Maviglio says he placed the purchase order. The order was 
executed as the stock dipped below $40 on June 20, closing that day at 
$39.85. 
The day before, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission announced a 
price-control plan that investors believed was damaging to generators' 
profits. On Monday, the stock closed at $37.13. 
Last week, the Davis administration stopped doing business with five energy 
traders under contract with the administration after Maviglio said 
administration lawyers "came to the determination that there are possible 
violations of the law or close to it." 
"It's not a crime to own energy stock," Maviglio said Monday. "The difference 
with these traders is they're making governmental decisions. They're 
committing the state's resources by spending money to buy power." 
Jim Knox, director of California Common Cause, said he believes the 
Governor's Office made critical errors while hiring staff to purchase energy 
for the state. 
"Had the Governor's Office gone to the trouble to have these people fill 
statements of economic interest, as they were required to do by law, they 
should have known this before they were hired and they shouldn't have been 
hired," Knox said.

The Energy industry seems to be in a somewhat tenuous state. As
credit and accounting standards have come unglued the integrity
of the biggest players is called into question. Accounting firms
have claimed their accounting practices to be "creative and
aggressive" while their clients claim that there actions were
"not unethical", with apparent stress on the "not" part. One now
battered marketer has been specifically accused of "suspending
the rules of corporate ethics and perhaps even put corporate
morality on vacation".

Words like scandal, allegations, suspicions and cover-up have
become rank in the industry. CEOs have been asked to leave their
positions, executives have been forcibly terminated while another
commits suicide; and the investigations continue, including
criminal ones. The situation is sobering.

It seems like these last few years have been full of bubbles
bursting as we all collectively share a cold bath of economic
reality. The techs tumbled and the stock markets followed, the
electricity market (at least in California) imploded, real bombs
are exploding all over the place and the mightiest energy
marketer has fallen; and it won't be getting back up. The biggest
bankruptcy in US history will definitely leave its mark on all of
us. To think, we thought the troubles of PG&E and the Cal-PX was
big news.

Arthur Levitt, former SEC boss, suggests that "Enron's collapse
did not occur in a vacuum ... (and was) ... was partly a result
of a culture of gamesmanship among go-go businesses that believe
it's okay to bend the rules". This is a fundamental folly of the
industry as people with limited energy knowledge (and integrity) 
play games with other peoples money and not understanding or
caring about the consequences. It is not surprising that the
stock value of other marketers is also beginning to plummet.

So the question of the day is: are you acting prudently? It is
insufficient to assume that might is right or size is protection.
Contracting with the largest does not secure your contract; no
more than using the largest accounting firm ensures your books
are right. We all leave a paper trail and that trail is visible
in a moonless night during a California forced blackout, even if
you order your accounting firm to delete the emails and shred the
"evidence".

In working with our clients, we have come to see that information
does not receive its due respect. Perhaps it's the fault of the
Internet and the information overload factor, but not respecting
information is costly. We have witnessed "lost deals" and poor
follow-up. We have seen the cost of not rigorously following
corporate trade, risk credit procedures and surely we have seen
the result of blind faith in the big guys. To this end we
actively support our clients to equip themselves to effectively
manage large amounts of market information.

Energy market participants, more so than perhaps other
industries, must heed the requirement for prudence. For many
prudence is a forgotten tradition from the franchise days.
Prudence in competitive markets, which all energy markets are to
some degree, means a lot more now than it did in the franchise
era. We are all under the purvey of the public, the investor and
the regulators. Not to recognize this fact can have severe
economic ramifications. Prudence now means having trade, risk and
credit policies and procedures, having the tools to manage and
analyze data and foremost, developing the ability to internally
make the right judgment calls.

      Having the Information and Doing Nothing About It
-----------------------------------------------------------------

It seems evident that Anderson, the government and Enron itself,
had privy to a lot of financial data that clearly indicated the 
eventual collapse of Enron.

*  Andersen contemplated dropping Enron as a client nearly one 
   year ago because of concerns due to Enron's accounting
   methodology.
*  The White House oversaw a study in October 2001 of economic
   repercussions of an    Enron collapse.
*  Sherron Watkins, a senior Enron Executive, wrote to Enron's
   chairman, Ken Lay, "I am incredibly nervous that we will
   implode in a wave of accounting scandals." last August 2001"
*  The writing was clearly on the wall but most were unable to
   react to the intelligence. It    all comes down to the
   lemming factor; we can see the cliff but just cannot
   avoid jumping.

Many in the industry suffer badly from the chronic inability to
react in a timely manner. This failure often results in severe
negative economic impacts. Either policy is not in place to allow
affirmative reaction or staff does not adhere to the policies
that exist.

Good corporate policy is the corner stone of sound market
participation

House Energy Subcommittee May Propose CA Emergency Options

House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee Chairman Joe Barton (R-TX) is 
predicting an emergency energy bill for California may be presented early 
next week to mitigate the state's power crisis through the summer. Among the 
hotly debated topics that may appear in a compromise bill were wholesale 
price caps, the possibility of granting federal regulators authority to site 
new power generation and transmission, mandatory demand side mitigation, and 
the removal of retail price caps for ratepayers.

While the state faced a second straight day of rolling blackouts, 
subcommittee members quizzed the three Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commissioners March 20 about the California situation. According to Barton, 
at Republican leadership meetings taking place at the same time, the 
California crisis was at the top of the agenda. Barton said he plans to 
discuss possible legislation with Subcommittee Ranking Member Rick Boucher 
(D-VA) after another panel is heard on March 22, and ideas will be considered 
over the weekend. But while he said it remains unclear whether anything will 
be presented, uncertain, time was of the essence -- he insisted that 
proposals would have to be introduced early next week. The remarks are 
another sign that the enormity of this summer's potential crisis is sinking 
in with legislators.

There seemed to be an uneasy acceptance during the hearing that California 
will inevitably come up short by several thousand megawatts this summer, and 
the need for unpleasant temporary mitigation measures has become urgent. Last 
week, in the Senate, Senator Gordon Smith (R-OR) offered a compromise with 
Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) in which he would accept temporary price caps as 
long as the state abandoned its steadfast refusal to pass wholesale rates 
onto consumers.

One of the more surprising suggestions came from Commissioner Linda Breathitt 
(D), who has been the most reserved FERC member throughout the crisis. She 
suggested that FERC's role in siting new transmission and generation 
facilities ought to be reconsidered.

"Under the Federal Power Act, the commission has no role in the permitting 
and siting of these new facilities," she said in her prepared statement. "I 
am beginning to believe this may need to be changed. FERC may need to have a 
greater role in the siting of new infrastructure, because shortages of 
generation and transmission likely will no longer be just single state 
issues. I believe these shortages could become interstate commerce issues 
that must be addressed by the Federal government."

In a frank exchange with Barton, the Commissioners all seemed in varying 
degrees amenable to the idea. "I think it is an intriguing idea," said 
Commissioner William Massey (D). FERC Chairman Curt Hebert (R) seemed 
cautiously approving of the idea, but only after noting that siting is done 
by the states for very good reasons. He warned not to "hardwire it," and 
acknowledged "some sort of one-stop shopping is a good idea." While Breathitt 
asked for Congressional authority for siting, Barton wondered about some 
measure that would give the state a time limit to do its own permitting 
before stepping in. But he added that something probably needs to happen. "I 
think it is the federal role to step in temporarily," he said.

Among the more contentious issues raised was temporary wholesale price caps. 
Arguing that FERC needed "to call a time out from this broken western 
electricity market," Commissioner Massey called for such caps calculated on a 
generator-by-generator basis with a $25 per megawatt addition, a firm sunset 
provision, and an exemption for new generation. He argued that without such 
protection during a grueling summer, a voter backlash could emerge and 
threaten the entire concept of electric competition in the region.

But the Subcommittee seemed decidedly hostile to the idea. Indeed, several 
Republican members pointed out throughout the debate that FERC only has 
ratemaking jurisdiction over 47 percent of the western market, which would 
limit their effectiveness. Additionally, many expressed the concern that it 
would effectively cut off potential power imports from Mexico and Canada.

It also appears increasingly unlikely FERC would put any such authority into 
use. Hebert, as he did before a Senate committee the previous week, warned 
that price caps have a dubious history, and added that they provide "no 
incentive to move into the forward market."

Breathitt also hesitated, suggesting that other options should be pursued 
first, and that price caps would only work if state regulators approved and 
public power authorities could be brought into the scheme.

Democratic Subcommittee members grilled the Commissioners about their recent 
refund orders for January and February that were calculated from proxy market 
prices. Boucher wanted to know why findings of "unjust and unreasonable" 
prices were limited to Stage 3 emergencies. "We deserve a more complete 
answer," he said. Hebert argued that to investigate further would stray 
outside their jurisdiction as set out by last year's California orders, and 
that the Commission did a thorough job of examining a wide range of 
transactions. In dissenting from this view, Massey expressed concern that 
FERC was limiting its scope, particularly in light of evidence from the 
state's own market monitors and scholars that market power abuse was likely.

Rep. Mary Bono (R-CA) applauded FERC's recent efforts. "While I believe that 
wholesale price caps are not beneficial for our long-term needs," she said. 
"I do believe, and further encourage, FERC to exercise its authority to call 
into question wholesale rates."

Rep. Edward Markey (D-MA) insisted that possible market gaming was 
detrimental to everyone. "Markets are built on public confidence," he said. 
"And right now the public has little reason to have confidence in the 
dysfunctional market that has been permitted to develop in California." He 
pressured the Commissioners to consider investigations of other companies 
under section 206 of the Federal Power Act, beyond the recently announced 
investigations into Williams Energy and AES. Some GOP members criticized the 
Democratic fervor to paint generators as unethical profiteers.

Rep. Steve Largent (R-OK), who represents Williams' home state, raised doubts 
about the validity of any such investigation. He demanded to know how exactly 
FERC established just and reasonable rates. When the Commissioners failed to 
present a satisfactory answer, he complained, "how can you hold someone 
accountable to a standard you don't know?" and suggested the investigation 
was "unconstitutional."

FYI.  This is THE story out here today.  Given the repugnant things that 
Maviglio has said about Enron over the past several months, it will be very 
interesting to see whether he'll be able to withstand the fact that all the 
time that he was saying those things, he owned our stock.  Gee, couldn't 
happen to a nicer guy.

Best,
Jeff

In addition, all this buzz about conflicts with traders and Calpine could put 
in jeopardy the state's contracts with Calpine, which may, in the end, be a 
very good thing for Direct Access.
Davis spokesman under fire for stock 
By Amy Chance and Dale Kasler
Bee Staff Writers
(Published July 31, 2001) 
Davis administration spokesman Steve Maviglio acknowledged Monday that he 
bought stock in Calpine Corp. in June, at a time when the company was 
announcing a breakthrough in its bid to build a controversial San Jose power 
plant. 
His disclosure came several days after Gov. Gray Davis dismissed five state 
power purchasers for owning stock in the company and drew new complaints that 
Davis administration officials may have improperly mixed their private 
finances and their public roles. 
Maviglio, now acting as interim communications director for the 
administration, said he put in an "open" order for Calpine stock May 31, 
agreeing to buy 300 shares once the stock hit a certain price. 
He said that threshold was met June 20, the day after an action by the 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission brought down "all energy stock prices 
across the board." 
Maviglio said he bought the stock for his individual retirement account, and 
it has since declined in value. Under terms of the open order, he said, he 
had no control over the exact date of purchase. 
Maviglio touted the company in his role as spokesman to the governor in a 
story published June 27 in The Bee. He said Monday that he was simply 
responding to a reporter's question about the company's positive reputation. 
"They have made a clear commitment to invest in California's future," 
Maviglio said at the time. "Their pricing has been far more reasonable than 
any other generator." 
In the interview, Maviglio also contrasted Calpine and Texas-based 
generators. He said Calpine "took a different tack from the Joe Bobs of the 
world," an apparent reference to Joe Bob Perkins, a senior executive with 
Reliant Energy Inc. of Houston. 
Maviglio acknowledged the stock ownership several days after the 
administration ended its relationship with several energy consultants who 
held stock in energy companies, including Calpine. 
Under pressure from Secretary of State Bill Jones, a Republican who hopes to 
challenge Davis for governor next year, the Davis administration has spent 
several weeks scrambling to answer questions about the stock holdings and 
potential conflicts of its consultants and energy traders. 
Jones said Monday that Maviglio should be fired. 
"These actions are unethical, unconscionable, unacceptable, and heads should 
roll," he said in a statement. He said the Democratic governor should direct 
all of his staff to immediately file updated conflict-of-interest statements 
to reflect current holdings. 
Jones, who last week asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to 
investigate administration consultants for insider trading, also said the 
probe should be expanded "to include all of the governor's staff." 
Federal law and SEC regulations forbid anyone from trading stocks while 
possessing "insider information" -- relevant facts not available to the 
public, according to the SEC. Violations can bring lawsuits and criminal 
prosecution. 
Michael Prozan, a Menlo Park lawyer and expert on insider trading, said the 
prohibition against it originally focused on halting company executives from 
profiting from news before it was disclosed publicly. 
But the laws have been broadened to include others besides company employees. 
Investment bankers, lawyers and journalists have been snared by 
insider-trading crackdowns. 
Davis' office was instrumental earlier this year in paving the way for 
removing barriers to construction of a Calpine plant in San Jose. On May 30, 
after opposing the project for years, San Jose Mayor Ron Gonzales announced 
he had negotiated an agreement addressing his concerns and agreed to support 
construction. 
His action came after Davis in April endorsed the plant's construction and as 
the state Energy Commission threatened to approve it over local objections. 
On June 20, the company announced it had won tentative state approval to 
build the plant. 
Maviglio said he buys many stocks and that Enron Corp. and Calpine are the 
only energy generators among them. He owns 100 shares of Enron stock, which 
he purchased in 1996. 
"I deal with hundreds of California companies just about every day, and this 
was one that I saw that looked like a good investment based on public 
knowledge," he said. "I read six newspapers a day or more, and I know what's 
going on in the world. If there's a standard that I can't invest in something 
that I have general public knowledge of, then I wouldn't have any stocks at 
all." 
Maviglio said that the "open" order he placed meant that he could not have 
used inside information to make his stock purchase. 
"Had I had specific knowledge about a contract being signed or what actually 
happened in the office of the mayor of San Jose ... that would have been 
unrelated," Maviglio said. "There was no timing-based sequence to it." 
Calpine stock, despite the company's considerable success, has slipped in 
recent weeks because of general investor anxiety about the California energy 
crisis. 
The stock, which trades on the New York Stock Exchange, closed at $49.30 on 
May 31, the day Maviglio says he placed the purchase order. The order was 
executed as the stock dipped below $40 on June 20, closing that day at 
$39.85. 
The day before, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission announced a 
price-control plan that investors believed was damaging to generators' 
profits. On Monday, the stock closed at $37.13. 
Last week, the Davis administration stopped doing business with five energy 
traders under contract with the administration after Maviglio said 
administration lawyers "came to the determination that there are possible 
violations of the law or close to it." 
"It's not a crime to own energy stock," Maviglio said Monday. "The difference 
with these traders is they're making governmental decisions. They're 
committing the state's resources by spending money to buy power." 
Jim Knox, director of California Common Cause, said he believes the 
Governor's Office made critical errors while hiring staff to purchase energy 
for the state. 
"Had the Governor's Office gone to the trouble to have these people fill 
statements of economic interest, as they were required to do by law, they 
should have known this before they were hired and they shouldn't have been 
hired," Knox said.

Calif Probe Focuses On Dynegy,Mirant Plants-Commissioners     
Updated: Monday, May 21, 2001 05:28 PM;ET     ; 
;
By Jason Leopold and Mark Golden 

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--California officials are focusing an investigation 
into the state's wholesale electricity markets on two power plants operated 
by two of the state's largest merchant power companies, Mirant Corp. (MIR, 
news, msgs) and a joint venture between Dynegy Inc. (DYN, news, msgs) and NRG 
Energy (NRG, news, msgs), according to two commissioners on the California 
Public Utilities Commission. 

The CPUC and the state Attorney General are investigating whether output was 
withheld in order to maintain high prices over the past seven months at 
Mirant's Pittsburg plant in northern California and the Encina power plant, 
which is equally owned by Dynegy and NRG, near San Diego. 

All power plants in the state are being examined, but investigators have 
found that the Encina and Pittsburg plants have reduced power during supply 
shortages, causing market prices to rise. 

But so far, the commissioners said, investigators have found no activity that 
is clearly illegal. 

"Is it unethical? Yes," one PUC commissioner said. "But is it illegal? No, 
unless there was collusion. This is the system we set up. What the generators 
are doing would be the appropriate thing to do if you are going to maximize 
your profit to shareholders." 

Spokesmen for Mirant and Dynegy flatly denied the charges. 

"What we did was both legal and ethical," said Mirant spokesman Chuck 
Griffin. "There was a very forthright attempt to keep these plants up and 
running. Unequivocally, we have never held anything back." 

Some of the turbines at the Encina plant are peaking units, which are 
supposed to ramp up and down to meet demand, Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengell 
said. The plant is operated by NRG, but Dynegy markets the power from the 
plant and tells NRG how much power to generate based on what has been sold. 

"We've done absolutely nothing to manipulate prices," Stengell said. 
"Electricity demand increases and decreases throughout the day. Our 
production increases and decreases to follow changing demand. Ultimately, the 
ISO determines the exact amount of dispatch." 

A spokesman for Attorney General William Lockyer declined to comment on the 
ongoing investigation. 

CPUC President Loretta Lynch told California newspapers last week that her 
office and that of Lockyer's have enough information to take legal action 
against generators next month, though she declined to name the companies 
involved and she said that the exact nature of the legal action is still 
under review. 

"We get really tired of these assertions with no evidence to back them up," 
Griffin said. "This whole idea that any generation was held back at any time 
is completely bogus. It is pure political rhetoric." 

Mirant's California power plants have run at full power during critical times 
except under one of two conditions, Griffin said. Either generating units 
were broken and had to be taken off line to be fixed, or they were beginning 
to run in a way that violated environmental restrictions and Mirant had to 
get permission to run at full power any longer. 

"There are no other reasons than those two," said Griffin. 

Nevertheless, several employees at the power plants involved have testified 
that generating units were ramped down even when the state's Independent 
System Operator had warned of tight supplies, according to one commissioner. 

And a senior NRG employee at the Encina power plant in Carlsbad told Dow 
Jones Newswires that he was told by Dynegy's Houston trading floor to "ramp 
down" the large 951-megawatt plant on at least 10 occasions when he knew 
power supplies were tight. 

"We would be told to ramp down the units even when we knew the state needed 
the megawatts," the employee said. "Then the spot price would go up, but we 
didn't really pay too much attention to that, because as far as we know 
everybody was doing this. We knew how much power other plants were operating 
at, and we knew they weren't at full capacity." 

NRG spokeswoman Meredith Moore said that the ISO gives instructions to Dynegy 
and Dynegy tells NRG what to do. "And there have been conditions when the ISO 
told us to ramp down during Stage 2 emergencies," Moore said. 

Also, one CPUC commissioner pointed out that the state's deregulation law 
doesn't require owners of power plants to bid all of their capacity into the 
market. 

The state's incumbent utilities, who were forced to sell their power plants 
as part of deregulation, also may have contributed to the problem, according 
to an ISO study. By not securing nearly enough power in advance to meet their 
customers projected needs, the state's three main utilities contributed to 36 
Stage 1 and 2 power emergencies last summer and forced the grid operator to 
pay a much higher price to keep the lights on. 

The utilities argued that they underscheduled their load so they wouldn't 
have to pay the generators' high bid prices. The ISO market last year had a 
price cap, while other markets did not. 

Mirant's Griffin, meanwhile, said all the finger pointing isn't solving the 
state's problem. 

"If they are going to get to a solution in California, they have to get 
beyond silly political rhetoric," Griffin said. "The real solution to the 
problem is to get new supply, and if they are going to do that they have to 
make this market look attractive to the kind of people who can build power 
plants."

Calif Fails To Find Illegal Acts By Generators -Sources
By Jason Leopold
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

06/12/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service

(This article was originally published Monday.) 

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- An investigation by California's attorney general 
and state utility regulators into alleged illegal behavior by electricity 
generators has failed to turn up evidence of criminal activity, persons 
familiar with the probe said Monday.
The sources - including two commissioners on the California Public Utilities 
Commission and an aide to Attorney General Bill Lockyer - said generators 
aren't likely to be prosecuted, even though it appears they did withhold 
supply, and that the state may pursue civil remedies as an alternative. 
"We have come to the conclusion that this type of behavior is not illegal," 
one PUC commissioner said. 
California Gov. Gray Davis was briefed on the investigation Monday night, 
spokesman Steve Maviglio said. Maviglio refused to disclose details of the 
attorney general's briefing, but said the investigation was ongoing. 
"We have not called off the dogs," Maviglio said. "We're still pressing the 
attorney general to pursue the investigation." 
The governor, who has repeatedly blamed the state's year-long power crisis on 
market manipulation by generators, is pressing federal regulators to order 
substantial refunds and impose price caps until the dysfunctional market is 
fixed. 
PUC President Loretta Lynch said last month that she had enough evidence to 
take legal action against generators, but that claim was "premature," another 
PUC commissioner said. 
The PUC commissioners said the investigation has uncovered evidence that 
generators created artificial shortages by withholding supply last summer and 
earlier this year, but after dozens of interviews with economists, traders 
and power plant employees found no evidence of collusion or other criminal 
behavior. 
"We do have evidence that they withheld power from the marketplace, that's 
documented," one of the commissioners said. "The question is whether that's 
illegal, and I don't think it is." 
The state is ultimately responsible for soaring power prices, the other 
commissioner said, because it passed a flawed deregulation bill. 
"The system that we set up requires the generators and marketers, in the best 
interest of their shareholders, to do exactly what they have done," the 
commissioner said. "Unless they're talking with each other and there is 
evidence of absolute colluding, we're not going to get to first base." 
The sources said the state may be preparing for a civil lawsuit against Duke 
Energy (DUK), Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Mirant Corp. (MIR), Williams Cos. (WMB), 
Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) and others, but that too is going to be difficult. 
"How do you sue someone for being unethical," the person in Lockyer's office 
said. 
A spokeswoman for Lockyer wouldn't comment, but said the probe is ongoing. 
Spokesmen for the energy companies also wouldn't comment on the 
investigation, but said they have submitted bid data and reams of documents 
related to how their power plants operate to Lockyer and the PUC. The 
generators have repeatedly denied allegations that they acted unlawfully. 
Severin Borenstein, director of the University of California at Berkeley 
Energy Institute, said the state would have a hard time proving otherwise. 
"I would not have expected them to find evidence of criminal antitrust 
behavior," Borenstein said. Prosecuting generators is "a longshot," he said: 
"They would actually have to find a smoking gun and evidence that these guys 
were in the same room." 
Phil Verlager, an economist specializing in energy issues, said generators 
didn't even act unethically, because the setup of California's deregulation 
law allowed generators to get away with withholding power. 
Even if no smoking gun has been found, tough talk by PUC President Lynch 
scared the suppliers, the commissioner said. 
"They got the message that they ought to play the game." 
Lynch didn't return calls for comment. 
Davis said Sunday the recent decline in power prices in the West is a 
"function of the extreme pressure on the energy cartel from Sacramento." 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has the responsibility to hold 
generators accountable for behavior that produces unjust and unreasonable 
prices, even if it isn't illegal, Borenstein said.

Calif Gov:Evidence May Allow Criminal Case Vs Generators
By Jason Leopold
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

06/12/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- California investigations have turned up a "growing 
body of evidence" that may allow the state's attorney general to pursue 
criminal charges against generators suspected by some of manipulating power 
prices in the state, the office of California Gov. Gray Davis said Tuesday. 
The governor's office didn't detail that evidence, however, and persons 
familiar with the probe conducted by the state attorney general and the 
California Public Utilities Commission maintained that no such evidence 
exists.
"The Attorney General gave the governor a progress report on the status of 
civil and criminal actions," Davis press secretary Steve Maviglio said in a 
short written statement. "There is a growing body of evidence that may give 
the Attorney General the opportunity to proceed with criminal as well as 
civil actions." 
Attorney General Bill Lockyer briefed Davis Monday night on the status of his 
investigation with the PUC into possible criminal antitrust behavior by 
generators operating in the state's wholesale electricity market. Maviglio 
didn't disclose further details of the investigation. 
Two PUC commissioners said the state has documented that supply was withheld, 
but hasn't been able to demonstrate such activity was illegal. 
"There is no evidence of criminal behavior," one said. "It just doesn't 
exist." 
S. David Freeman, senior energy adviser to Davis, acknowledged the 
distinction Tuesday after being asked by reporters in Washington, D.C., about 
allegations generators withheld supply to boost prices. 
"It may not be criminal conduct, but it's a crime," he said. 
Economists and energy experts deposed by Lockyer have said the attorney 
general will have difficulty trying to prosecute generators, because there's 
likely no smoking gun. 
Any claim that the investigation hasn't turned up evidence of criminal 
activity is an "overstatement," Lockyer spokeswoman Sandra Michioku said. 
The investigation is ongoing, she said. 
Davis said Sunday that pressure from Sacramento has contributed to the recent 
sharp decline in power prices in the West. An aide to Lockyer said Tuesday 
the attorney general needs to keep alive the perception that he is close to 
prosecuting the energy companies "so they will continue to play the game." 
The governor, who has repeatedly blamed the state's year-long power crisis on 
market manipulation by generators, is pressing federal regulators to order 
substantial refunds and impose price caps until the dysfunctional market is 
fixed.

Calif Judge To Rule On Confidentiality For Generator Data

06/12/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- A Los Angeles Superior Court Judge said Tuesday he 
will issue a written ruling on a lawsuit filed by Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) 
against the state's attorney general to prevent confidential subpoenaed 
documents from being shared with third parties. 
Superior Court Judge George H. Wu said he would take the case under 
submission and issue a written ruling in less than 90 days.
Reliant, Dynegy Inc. (DYN) and Mirant Corp. (MIR) agreed May 22 to turn over 
confidential documents to California Attorney General Bill Lockyer, who is 
investigating allegations of manipulation and criminal behavior in the 
state's wholesale power market. 
Reliant agreed to turn over the information, which includes bid data, as long 
as Lockyer's office agreed not to share it with third parties. 
Lockyer said last month that he wouldn't share the information pending a 
court hearing on the issue.

THIRD CIRCUIT TASK FORCE URGES ONLY LIMITED USE OF AUCTIONS
TO PICK CLASS COUNSEL; JUDGES CRITICAL OF REPORT'S
NEGATIVITY

Judicially controlled auctions for the selection of counsel
in class actions should be used only in "certain limited
circumstances," according to a draft report issued by the
Third Circuit Task Force on Selection of Class Counsel. An
auction might be appropriate for a case in which the
defendant's liability appears clear, damages appear to be
both very large and collectible, and the lead plaintiff is
not a sophisticated litigant that has already retained
counsel of its choice through a reasonable, arm's-length
process, the task force suggests.

Several judges criticize the report as being too hostile
toward the innovative idea of competitive bidding for
selecting class counsel. The judges, participating in a
panel discussion at the 2001 Third Circuit Judicial
Conference, say the report is "too restrictive." For
instance, the task force should encourage more
experimentation with the process of setting fees at the
outset of litigation rather than waiting until the end, one
judge suggests. But others, who agree with the tenor of the
report, say bidding is overrated as a means of keeping
counsel fees reasonable. . . . Page s 2326,  . . . Page 2318

NEW YORK BAR PROPOSES AMENDING ABA MODEL RULES TO ALLOW
CAREFULLY REGULATED MULTIDISCIPLINARY ALLIANCES

The New York State Bar Association files a proposal with the
American Bar Association recommending amendment of the Model
Rules of Professional Conduct to allow limited and carefully
regulated "contractual relationships" and other affiliations
between lawyers and nonlawyers who want to offer their
clients integrated multidisciplinary services.

Foremost among the safeguards being advocated by the New
York bar are measures that would prohibit nonlawyers from
holding any ownership or managerial interest in law firms;
sharing legal fees with lawyers; directing or regulating the
professional judgment of lawyers; or compromising in any
other way a lawyer's duty to safeguard client interests. The
proposal is patterned on recent amendments to the New York
Code of Professional Responsibility allowing such
affiliations. . . . Page 2315

INS ADOPTS INTERIM PROCEDURES FOR ADJUDICATING CASES OF
UNREMOVABLE ALIENS SEEKING RELEASE FROM DETENTION

The Immigration and Naturalization Service issues an interim
rule governing detention of aliens who are subject to final
orders of removal but cannot likely be removed in the
foreseeable future because no country will accept them. The
rule responds to the U.S. Supreme Court's recent "Zadvydas"
decision, which held that, absent special circumstances, the
attorney general lacks authority to detain such aliens
indefinitely.

The rule specifies procedures for aliens who have been
detained beyond the statutory 90-day removal period to
demonstrate that their removal is unlikely in the reasonably
foreseeable future. Aliens seeking relief must make a
threshold showing that they have cooperated with the INS's

Calif Fails To Find Illegal Acts By Generators -Sources
By Jason Leopold
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

06/12/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

(This article was originally published Monday.) 

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- An investigation by California's attorney general and state utility regulators into alleged illegal behavior by electricity generators has failed to turn up evidence of criminal activity, persons familiar with the probe said Monday.
The sources - including two commissioners on the California Public Utilities Commission and an aide to Attorney General Bill Lockyer - said generators aren't likely to be prosecuted, even though it appears they did withhold supply, and that the state may pursue civil remedies as an alternative. 
"We have come to the conclusion that this type of behavior is not illegal," one PUC commissioner said. 
California Gov. Gray Davis was briefed on the investigation Monday night, spokesman Steve Maviglio said. Maviglio refused to disclose details of the attorney general's briefing, but said the investigation was ongoing. 
"We have not called off the dogs," Maviglio said. "We're still pressing the attorney general to pursue the investigation." 
The governor, who has repeatedly blamed the state's year-long power crisis on market manipulation by generators, is pressing federal regulators to order substantial refunds and impose price caps until the dysfunctional market is fixed. 
PUC President Loretta Lynch said last month that she had enough evidence to take legal action against generators, but that claim was "premature," another PUC commissioner said. 
The PUC commissioners said the investigation has uncovered evidence that generators created artificial shortages by withholding supply last summer and earlier this year, but after dozens of interviews with economists, traders and power plant employees found no evidence of collusion or other criminal behavior. 
"We do have evidence that they withheld power from the marketplace, that's documented," one of the commissioners said. "The question is whether that's illegal, and I don't think it is." 
The state is ultimately responsible for soaring power prices, the other commissioner said, because it passed a flawed deregulation bill. 
"The system that we set up requires the generators and marketers, in the best interest of their shareholders, to do exactly what they have done," the commissioner said. "Unless they're talking with each other and there is evidence of absolute colluding, we're not going to get to first base." 
The sources said the state may be preparing for a civil lawsuit against Duke Energy (DUK), Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Mirant Corp. (MIR), Williams Cos. (WMB), Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) and others, but that too is going to be difficult. 
"How do you sue someone for being unethical," the person in Lockyer's office said. 
A spokeswoman for Lockyer wouldn't comment, but said the probe is ongoing. 
Spokesmen for the energy companies also wouldn't comment on the investigation, but said they have submitted bid data and reams of documents related to how their power plants operate to Lockyer and the PUC. The generators have repeatedly denied allegations that they acted unlawfully. 
Severin Borenstein, director of the University of California at Berkeley Energy Institute, said the state would have a hard time proving otherwise. 
"I would not have expected them to find evidence of criminal antitrust behavior," Borenstein said. Prosecuting generators is "a longshot," he said: "They would actually have to find a smoking gun and evidence that these guys were in the same room." 
Phil Verlager, an economist specializing in energy issues, said generators didn't even act unethically, because the setup of California's deregulation law allowed generators to get away with withholding power. 
Even if no smoking gun has been found, tough talk by PUC President Lynch scared the suppliers, the commissioner said. 
"They got the message that they ought to play the game." 
Lynch didn't return calls for comment. 
Davis said Sunday the recent decline in power prices in the West is a "function of the extreme pressure on the energy cartel from Sacramento." 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has the responsibility to hold generators accountable for behavior that produces unjust and unreasonable prices, even if it isn't illegal, Borenstein said.

Calif Gov:Evidence May Allow Criminal Case Vs Generators
By Jason Leopold
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

06/12/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- California investigations have turned up a "growing body of evidence" that may allow the state's attorney general to pursue criminal charges against generators suspected by some of manipulating power prices in the state, the office of California Gov. Gray Davis said Tuesday. 
The governor's office didn't detail that evidence, however, and persons familiar with the probe conducted by the state attorney general and the California Public Utilities Commission maintained that no such evidence exists.
"The Attorney General gave the governor a progress report on the status of civil and criminal actions," Davis press secretary Steve Maviglio said in a short written statement. "There is a growing body of evidence that may give the Attorney General the opportunity to proceed with criminal as well as civil actions." 
Attorney General Bill Lockyer briefed Davis Monday night on the status of his investigation with the PUC into possible criminal antitrust behavior by generators operating in the state's wholesale electricity market. Maviglio didn't disclose further details of the investigation. 
Two PUC commissioners said the state has documented that supply was withheld, but hasn't been able to demonstrate such activity was illegal. 
"There is no evidence of criminal behavior," one said. "It just doesn't exist." 
S. David Freeman, senior energy adviser to Davis, acknowledged the distinction Tuesday after being asked by reporters in Washington, D.C., about allegations generators withheld supply to boost prices. 
"It may not be criminal conduct, but it's a crime," he said. 
Economists and energy experts deposed by Lockyer have said the attorney general will have difficulty trying to prosecute generators, because there's likely no smoking gun. 
Any claim that the investigation hasn't turned up evidence of criminal activity is an "overstatement," Lockyer spokeswoman Sandra Michioku said. 
The investigation is ongoing, she said. 
Davis said Sunday that pressure from Sacramento has contributed to the recent sharp decline in power prices in the West. An aide to Lockyer said Tuesday the attorney general needs to keep alive the perception that he is close to prosecuting the energy companies "so they will continue to play the game." 
The governor, who has repeatedly blamed the state's year-long power crisis on market manipulation by generators, is pressing federal regulators to order substantial refunds and impose price caps until the dysfunctional market is fixed.

Calif Judge To Rule On Confidentiality For Generator Data

06/12/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- A Los Angeles Superior Court Judge said Tuesday he will issue a written ruling on a lawsuit filed by Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) against the state's attorney general to prevent confidential subpoenaed documents from being shared with third parties. 
Superior Court Judge George H. Wu said he would take the case under submission and issue a written ruling in less than 90 days.
Reliant, Dynegy Inc. (DYN) and Mirant Corp. (MIR) agreed May 22 to turn over confidential documents to California Attorney General Bill Lockyer, who is investigating allegations of manipulation and criminal behavior in the state's wholesale power market. 
Reliant agreed to turn over the information, which includes bid data, as long as Lockyer's office agreed not to share it with third parties. 
Lockyer said last month that he wouldn't share the information pending a court hearing on the issue.

The Securities and Exchange Commission has launched a preliminary inquiry 
into whether energy consultants advising Gov. Gray Davis used inside 
information to trade stocks of power companies doing business with the state, 
a source with knowledge of the matter said Monday. 
The federal agency began its review late last week, the source said, in 
response to a request from California Secretary of State Bill Jones. A 
Republican rival of Davis, Jones charged that stock trading by consultants 
may have violated federal laws barring buying and selling based on 
information not available to the public.
On Friday, top aides to the governor disclosed that five consultants had been 
fired for possible conflicts of interest between their official positions and 
their personal finances. 
As news of the SEC inquiry spread through the capital Monday, Davis officials 
were confronted by a flurry of questions about who in the administration owns 
energy stocks. 
Financial disclosure records filed by the governor's spokesman, Steve 
Maviglio, show that he owns between $10,000 and $100,000 in a Texas company 
he and his boss have accused of making "obscene" profits while California has 
been "on its knees." Maviglio said he bought the shares in Houston-based 
Enron Corp. in 1996. 
"It's not a crime to own energy stock," Maviglio said. 
He also owns 300 shares of San Jose-based Calpine Corp., which has the 
largest share of the $43 billion in long-term state power contracts. 
Maviglio placed the order for the stock on May 31, one day after San Jose's 
mayor dropped his opposition to a controversial Calpine plant favored by the 
governor and others. Under the terms of Maviglio's purchase, the transaction 
was completed about three weeks later when the stock reached $40 a share, a 
value of $12,000. It has since fallen in value. 
"I viewed it as a good long-term investment," Maviglio said, adding that he 
purchased the shares for his retirement account based on publicly available 
information. 
The Davis administration has spared Calpine the kind of fierce criticisms 
that it has leveled at other electricity suppliers, such as Enron. But 
California's grid operator has identified the company as one of many energy 
merchants to overcharge the state millions of dollars. 
The fired consultants also owned shares in Calpine, ranging in value from 
several thousand dollars to more than $100,000, records show. 
Another top Davis administration official, legal affairs secretary Barry 
Goode, disclosed in his economic interest statement that he recently held 
between $100,000 and $1 million in another out-of-state company accused of 
multimillion-dollar price gouging. 
In a statement, Goode said he sold his stock in Williams Co's. a month after 
he began working for the governor in February. Goode said the shares were 
supposed to be sold before he went on the state payroll, but his broker 
failed to do so. 
In light of the recent disclosures, Secretary of State Jones said the 
governor must do more to ensure the public that its interest comes first. 
"The governor should direct all of his staff to immediately file updated 
conflict of interest statements that reflect current holdings and any 
activity since their last statement of economic interest was filed," said 
Jones, who is seeking the GOP nomination for governor. 
Word of the SEC's entry into California's energy problems comes as the 
governor faces harsh criticism from lawmakers and others for the quick and 
broad hiring of highly paid private consultants to guide him through the 
crisis. 
In his written request to the SEC, Jones said that recently filed disclosure 
documents showed that at least one consultant bought and sold shares of two 
energy companies within the same month, raising "a red flag" about the 
possibility of insider trading. 
State law prohibits officials from participating in decisions involving their 
personal financial interests. 
The five consultants fired last week were among 11 named in Jones' letter, 
delivered to the San Francisco office of the SEC last Wednesday. It was not 
clear which individuals are the focus of the SEC's inquiry, or whether the 
agency's review would result in any charges. 
Two of the former traders said Monday that they had not been contacted by 
federal investigators and knew nothing of an inquiry into possible insider 
trading. 
But William Mead, fired Thursday, said it is no mystery why so many of his 
colleagues owned Calpine stock. 
Mead said he bought it 2 1/2 years ago and made so much money he recommended 
it to his colleagues last year, while they all still worked for the 
now-defunct California Power Exchange in Alhambra. Calpine power was not 
traded on that exchange, so there was no conflict of interest, he said. 
Mead and three other energy traders--hired by the state in February and 
March--were terminated by the Davis administration for allegedly buying power 
for the state from Calpine while owning the company's stock. Fired traders 
Herman Leung, Peggy Cheng and Constantine Louie did not list the date of 
their Calpine purchases on financial statements that the state required to be 
filed only two weeks ago. 
"But I'm sure they bought it while they were still at the power exchange, 
because that's when we discussed it," Mead said. "It was kind of like a 
hobby. I'm sure it wasn't done with the intent to manipulate." 
Former trader Elaine Griffin, who also owned Calpine stock and resigned two 
weeks ago to take another job, said she didn't know she owned energy 
securities until she checked with her financial advisor July 13, just before 
leaving her state job. 
Griffin said she and her husband own about $10,000 worth of Calpine stock in 
individual retirement accounts managed by their advisor, who bought the stock 
Feb. 1 without their knowledge, she said, after research found it to be a 
good investment. 
"I kind of feel like we've been used for political reasons," Griffin said. 
"We would have disclosed anything right at first, but they never asked." 
As a trader, Griffin said she occasionally bought Calpine power for the 
state, but only at market prices. 
Meanwhile, two Democratic political consultants, who helped Davis polish his 
image after the ongoing energy crisis caused his poll numbers to plummet, 
have agreed to accept no payment for their work as part of an out-of-court 
settlement of a taxpayer lawsuit. 
Tom Hiltachk, a lawyer for conservative anti-tax activist Lewis Uhler, said 
the settlement was reached last Friday after negotiations with lawyers for 
communications consultants Mark Fabiani and Chris Lehane. 
"Now they will not receive one red cent," said Hiltachk. "Very simply Mr. 
Fabiani and Mr. Lehane have agreed to cease all activities for the governor, 
to accept no payments for their services and to basically get out of the 
consulting business with the governor." 
As his part of the agreement, Hiltachk said, Uhler withdrew his lawsuit 
Monday morning. 
Uhler had filed a lawsuit against the two consultants and Controller Kathleen 
Connell in June contending that they should not receive any payments because 
of a conflict of interest. The two men also did consulting work for 
financially troubled Southern California Edison, which was seeking help from 
Davis and the Legislature. 
Connell, a former Los Angeles mayoral candidate who has been at odds with 
Davis since he endorsed an opponent, had held up the payments pending the 
outcome of the lawsuit. 
Under an agreement with Davis, the men were to have been paid $30,000 a month 
for six months. 
Fabiani and Lehane could not be reached for comment.

Davis' top spokesman bought stock in power firm / Adviser denies conflict of 
interest

Chronicle Sacramento Bureau

The San Francisco Chronicle
FINAL
A.1
(Copyright 2001)

Already on the defensive over its energy advisers' financial holdings, Gov. 
Gray Davis' administration came under fresh attack yesterday when his chief 
spokesman admitted buying $12,000 worth of Calpine Corp. stock last month. 
Steve Maviglio, Davis' acting director of communications, denied that his 
purchase of the San Jose energy company's stock constituted a conflict of 
interest. He said he would sell the stock if Davis or administration lawyers 
asked him to.
"I invested in a growing California company," Maviglio said. "It's sad when 
somebody tries to link owning energy stock with a conflict of interest." 
The revelation came the same day that two high-priced consultants Davis 
brought in earlier this year to help sell his energy policies to the public 
agreed not to take any money for the work they have done. Davis was 
criticized for hiring the two, partly because they had also worked as 
consultants for Southern California Edison. 
On Friday, Davis fired five energy advisers for possible conflict- 
of-interest problems after they helped negotiate state spot-market purchases 
or long-term power contracts. Four of the five owned stock in Calpine, and 
the fifth held Enron shares. 
ON THE DEFENSIVE 
Maviglio, who had the task of explaining the firings, was on the defensive 
himself yesterday. 
He bought the Calpine stock in June after asking his broker to invest in it 
when shares hit a certain price, he said. He said that showed he had made his 
decision independently of whatever action he might have taken in the 
governor's office on any particular day. 
Calpine's stock has dropped some in the past month. As of yesterday, the 300 
shares that Maviglio bought for $12,000 were worth about $11,100. 
Maviglio said he had spoken out against Calpine as much as other energy 
companies. He also owns Enron stock that he bought in February 1996 and has 
disclosed on all forms, he added. 
"I've called them pirates and gougers and lumped them in with all the rest of 
the generators," Maviglio said. 
Secretary of State Bill Jones, an announced GOP opponent of Davis for 
governor in 2002, said Maviglio should be fired. 
"These actions are unethical and unacceptable," said Jones, who called on the 
governor's staff to release updated conflict-of- interest statements. "He had 
the power to promote Calpine through press releases. That seems to me to be a 
clear conflict of interest." 
Calpine sold the state $14 million worth of power earlier this year and has a 
large share of the $43 billion in long-term contracts for electricity that 
the state has entered into. 
Earlier this month, when he threw the ceremonial switch on a new Calpine 
plant in Pittsburg, Davis singled out the company as being more cooperative 
with California than out-of-state suppliers that the governor has 
characterized as gougers. 
IMAGE-POLISHING 
The Davis administration tried to put another energy-related controversy 
behind it yesterday as the two consultants brought in by the governor to 
burnish his image agreed to forgo more than $50,000 in work they did for the 
state. 
Chris Lehane and Mark Fabiani will receive no compensation and will leave the 
Davis administration immediately, under a settlement in a lawsuit filed on 
behalf of a national taxpayer rights group. 
Lehane and Fabiani -- nicknamed the "Masters of Disaster" for their work in 
getting former President Bill Clinton out of political jams -- started in the 
governor's office in May and were originally supposed to be paid $30,000 a 
month. 
It was later revealed that they had also worked as consultants for Southern 
California Edison, which is trying to swing a deal with the state to avoid 
bankruptcy. State Controller Kathleen Connell said she would not pay the two. 
"It really raises the question in my mind, what is it about 
conflict-of-interest and other ethical rules that the governor's office 
doesn't understand?" said Lewis Uhler, president of the National Tax 
Limitation Committee, which filed the lawsuit. 
In June, Davis said Fabiani was no longer a communications consultant because 
his work had been "successfully implemented." Lehane, on the other hand, 
dropped his contract with Edison and signed a new agreement with Davis. 
Lehane's new contract required him to work a maximum of 66 hours a month at 
$150 an hour. His payments were to be capped at $76,000 for work from June 26 
to Nov. 20, 2001. 
'OUTRAGEOUS EXPENSE' 
"This was an outrageous expense to taxpayers," Uhler said. "I believe there 
was a clear violation of conflict-of-interest laws." 
The consultants decided it was not worth the legal fees to fight the lawsuit, 
Maviglio said. The two could not be reached for comment. 
"It's shameful when people have to surrender their jobs in public service 
because of a lawsuit," Maviglio said. 
Jones, who filed a complaint with the Fair Political Practices Commission 
concerning the two consultants, said, "I think it's clear from recent actions 
by the governor's office that there have been rampant violations of the 
state's conflict-of-interest laws. Their attempts to mitigate the damage from 
these violations is too little, too late." 
Jones said Davis should immediately require all of the consultants hired 
during the energy crisis to file financial statements. There are 21 advisers 
involved in power purchasing whom Davis has exempted, he said. 
All the contractors who are required to file reports have done so, said 
Maviglio. 
In a related development, the Los Angeles Times quoted a source as saying the 
Securities and Exchange Commission has launched a preliminary inquiry into 
whether energy consultants advising Davis used inside information to trade 
stocks of power companies doing business with the state. 
The federal agency began its review late last week, the source said, in 
response to a request from Jones.

Davis press secretary confirms buying energy company stock

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - Gov. Gray Davis' press secretary recently purchased 
the same energy stock as five consultants the governor fired last week, he 
disclosed Monday. 
Steve Maviglio confirmed that on June 20, he bought 300 shares of stock in 
Calpine Corp., a San Jose-based power generator that has received about $13 
billion in state contracts to supply electricity for up to 20 years.
Maviglio's disclosure comes after Davis' office hastily ended the contracts 
of five consultants who helped negotiate state power contracts and held stock 
in energy companies. 
In a related development, an anonymous source told the Los Angeles Times on 
Monday that the Securities and Exchange Commission has launched a preliminary 
inquiry into whether the consultants used inside information to trade the 
energy stocks. 
About two dozen Davis energy consultants were required to fill out financial 
disclosure statements after complaints of conflict of interest by Republicans 
and consumer groups. 
"When we reviewed them, we found possible violations of the law and took 
swift action," Maviglio said Monday before Secretary of State Bill Jones 
issued a press release calling for his termination. 
Jones, a Republican, is a candidate for the GOP nomination to challenge Davis 
in November 2002. 
Maviglio defended his purchase, saying that he "owns several stocks in 
companies in all fields that are growing and are based in California." 
Maviglio said Monday that he requested on May 31 to purchase the stock if it 
dipped to $40 a share, which it did two days after a June 18 ruling by 
federal energy regulators restricting wholesale electricity prices in 
California and 10 other states. 
Maviglio served as Davis' chief spokesman urging the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission to impose price ceilings on electricity wholesalers. 
He also said he owns between $10,000 and $100,000 stock in Houston-based 
Enron Corp. He said he purchased the stock in 1997 and has reported it on 
financial disclosure forms. He said that it is "closer to $10,000." 
Meanwhile, two energy consultants to Davis have agreed to forgo more than 
$50,000 in work they did for the state. 
Chris Lehane and Mark Fabiani will forgo the payments as part of a settlement 
with a Sacramento-area resident who filed a lawsuit objecting to their 
hiring, calling it a conflict of interest. 
Fabiani could not be reached for comment Monday. In the settlement, they 
admitted no wrongdoing. 
Lehane issued a statement through the governor's office, calling it "simply 
not worth the bother to challenge the controller in court." 
Davis has come under fire for his May hiring of Lehane, former press 
secretary for Vice President Al Gore, and Fabiani, a deputy campaign manager 
for Gore's presidential run. 
They were hired to help shape Davis' response to the energy crisis, and 
helped craft Davis' aggressive attack on Texas-based energy companies and 
President Bush. 
Both also have advised Southern California Edison, which is negotiating for 
state help in avoiding bankruptcy. Financial disclosure forms showed they 
have each received at least $10,000 from Edison in the past year. 
Davis announced at the end of June that Fabiani terminated his contract, and 
Davis scaled back Lehane's role with the state. 
State Controller Kathleen Connell then said she would not pay Lehane and 
Fabiani for any of their work and now the two have agreed they will not fight 
her decision, Maviglio said. 
Lewis K. Uhler, the Placer County man who filed the lawsuit, said the 
settlement "accomplished our objectives." 
"We wanted to block the egregious use of taxpayer funds for essentially 
political spinmeisters," he said. Uhler is president of the Roseville-based 
National Tax Limitation Committee. 
Maviglio said that Fabiani and Lehane "did good work for the state" and 
helped the state win victories with federal regulators.

India's Power Boards Lose $5 Bln as Subsidies Rise, Paper Says
2001-07-31 01:53 (New York)


     New Delhi, July 31 (Bloomberg) -- India's state
electricity boards that distribute power lost 260 billion
rupees ($5.5 billion) in the year ended March because of rising
subsidies and electricity thefts, the Business Standard
reported, citing government figures.
     Power subsidies, mainly to farmers, rose 12 percent to
370.37 billion rupees last year and made up for half the
average tariff of 2.12 rupees a kilowatt-hour. Subsidies have
risen 83 percent since 1997.
     Power costs have risen 41 percent the past three years to
3.03 rupees a kilowatt-hour though the growth in tariffs has
been lower at 28 percent, leading to losses, the paper said.
     Forced to sell subsidized power to farmers and hurt by
power thefts, electricity boards are unable to pay power
generators. Two U.S. power producers, Enron Corp. and AES
Corp., have asked the government to buy out their stakes in
local power projects because of unpaid bills.



India To Evaluate Options On Enron Stake Buy Out Offer

07/31/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- India will evaluate all options before making a 
decision on U.S. energy major Enron Corp.'s (ENE) offer to sell its majority 
stake in the controversial Dabhol Power Co. to the government, a senior 
Indian Power Ministry official said Tuesday. 
"We are closely watching all the developments. Enron hasn't formally 
approached us with an offer. It will be premature to say anything on the 
issue now. The government will take a stand on the Enron matter only after 
thoroughly studying all the prospects and consequences," said the official.
A spokesman for Dabhol Power Co. said his company has had no contact with the 
federal government lately. 
Enron said Saturday the company wanted to sell its stake in Dabhol Power Co. 
to India's federal government or one of the project's lenders. 
Enron holds a controlling 65% equity in Dabhol Power Co., located in the 
western Indian state of Maharashtra. The Dabhol Power Co. plant has a 
capacity to generate 740 megawatts but is currently not operating because of 
payment disputes with its sole buyer, the Maharashtra State Electricity 
Board. MSEB stopped drawing electricity from Dabhol May 29, saying the 
company's tariffs were "unaffordable." 
Work on an 85% complete 1,444 MW phase II of the Dabhol project was stopped 
in mid-June because of Dabhol Power Co.'s financial difficulties. 
At $2.9 billion, Dabhol Power Co. is the single largest foreign investment in 
India to date.

INDIA PRESS:Govt Asks Lenders To Bail Out Dabhol Pwr Proj

07/31/2001
Dow Jones Asian Equities Report
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- India's federal government has directed financial 
institutions, led by the Industrial Development Bank of India (P.IDB), to 
work out a package for saving the controversial $2.9 billion Dabhol power 
project in the western Indian state of Maharahtra, reports the Financial 
Express. 
U.S. energy company Enron Corp. (ENE) holds a controlling 65% stake in Dabhol 
Power Co., which operates a 740-megawatt power plant.
The move comes on the heels of Enron's decision to pull out of India's power 
sector, says the newspaper report. 
The package is aimed at completing the 1,444-megawatt phase II of the Dabhol 
project. A sum of $550 million is required to complete the project, of which 
lenders have agreed to pump in around $320 million. As Enron doesn't want to 
inject fresh money into Dabhol, the financial institutions will either have 
to scout for a new investor for the project or pump in the remaining $230 
million themselves, the report said.

Report: Indian government orders financial institutions to save Dabhol power 
project, as Enron wants to pull out

07/31/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

NEW DELHI, India (AP) - The federal government has told financial 
institutions to pump in more money or find a new investor to save the Dabhol 
power project, now that U.S.-based Enron Corp. has said it wants out, The 
Financial Express reported Tuesday. 
The Industrial Development Bank of India, and other institutions, have been 
told to work out a package to complete the dlrs 2.9 billion project in 
western Maharashtra state, the paper said, quoting unidentified officials of 
the banks and the Power Ministry.
Power Ministry officials were quoted as saying that Enron had agreed in 
principle to finish the project if the dlrs 230 million can be found, and 
then Enron could sell its majority stake. 
The project was billed as the world's largest natural gas-fired power plant, 
able to generate 2,184 megawatts once completed at Dabhol, 335 kilometers 
(210 miles) south of Bombay. The second phase, to be run on liquefied natural 
gas, was to be commissioned by the end of the year. 
Enron, based in Houston, Texas has invested dlrs 875 million in the project - 
India's biggest foreign investment. Enron said July 28 it wants the Indian 
government and lenders to buy out its 65 per cent stake. 
The plant stopped production in May after its only customer, the Maharashtra 
State Electricity Board, said it was canceling a seven-year-old power 
purchase agreement. The state also stopped buying power from Enron's 
two-year-old naphtha plant. 
The state says Enron's prices are too high and has demanded the contract be 
renegotiated. 
The Financial Express said that lenders are ready to pump another dlrs 320 
million into Dabhol, but there is a shortfall of an additional dlrs 230 
million. 
The financial institutions will have to find a new investor or provide the 
money themselves, the newspaper quoted its sources as saying. 
It also quoted Power Ministry officials as saying it would be difficult to 
find a buyer until the project is completed. Some of the needed money may be 
sought from Maharashtra state, which had committed to making payments, the 
paper quoted Power Ministry officials as saying. 
The current charges for power are still a matter of contention, however. 
The paper said Enron had reduced its price demands, after the government 
offered various tax and customs duty concessions, but the government wants 
the price for electricity to be cut further.

FIs asked to work out deal for Dabhol completion
Soma Banerjee

07/31/2001
The Economic Times
Copyright (C) 2001 The Economic Times; Source: World Reporter (TM)

FINANCIAL institutions led by Industrial Development Bank of India have been 
directed by the Centre to work out a package by which the controversial 
Dabhol Power plant can be completed which in turn could pave the way for the 
sale of equity by Enron. 
Enron, which has a $2.9 billion stake in the project has recently announced 
its decision to pull out of India. This comes barely weeks after the visit of 
Enrons chairman Kenneth Lay who had then maintained that the 'company is 
committed to India' and is looking forward to 'positive talks'.
The package which will be submitted to a high level committee, which is 
represented by the finance, power and law ministry and headed by union 
finance secretary Ajit Kumar. Representatives of the Union power and finance 
ministry met last week to thrash out the main objectives of the package. 
According to FI sources, the package which is expected to be finalised 
shortly will have to have a twin objective of completing the project and 
finding takers for the power to be generated. 
The phase II of the project (phase I of which is already operational) 
requires an additional investment of $550 million to be completed of which 
$320 million has already been tied up with the lenders. 
Another $230 million has to be pumped in into the project. Given the fact 
that Enron is unwilling to pump in any more funds in the project, the FIs 
will have to look for the additional resources. 
The required resources can be moped up only through the infusion of fresh 
investments by a new developer or if the FIs are willing to put in the money 
themselves. 
FIs are also holding discussions with MSEB to honour their obligation and pay 
up the fixed charges of about Rs 95 crore which could then be used for 
completing the project. 
Sources said although Enron has decided to call it a day in the Indian power 
sector, the company is not averse to the proposal of completing this project 
without any further investments. Experts are of the view that this would make 
sense even for Enron who could then expect a better price for its equity. 
On the sale of power and restructuring of tariff, the FIs are holding 
negotiations with DPC and the various agencies who play a role in 
contributing to the tariff. While DPC has offered a tariff of Rs 3.59 per 
unit, the FIs will try and work towards a tariff close to Rs 2.80 per unit. 
Apart from aspects like working a separate arrangement for the LNG plant, 
reduction in Customs duty and sales tax on LNG, attempts would be made to 
also try and reduce LNG prices by asking the suppliers to rework their rates. 
Official sources indicated that Enrons decision to finally announce its 
intention to exit from the Dabhol project is likely to lead to some decision 
this way or the other. 
The Centre which has till now played a passive role and has left the issue to 
be resolved bilaterally is now playing a more proactive role and will 
definitely take every step to avoid litigations at the international lenders 
level.

Houston-Area Firms Brace for Onslaught by Code Red Computer Worm
Tom Fowler

07/31/2001
KRTBN Knight-Ridder Tribune Business News: Houston Chronicle - Texas
Copyright (C) 2001 KRTBN Knight Ridder Tribune Business News; Source: World 
Reporter (TM)

Technicians at Reliant Communications and other Internet service providers 
will burn the midnight oil tonight and well into Wednesday, fighting the 
rebirth of an Internet worm some say could be the worst threat to the Web to 
date. 
The Code Red worm, an online infection first spotted on July 19, is expected 
to awaken from its dormant state on hundreds of thousands of computers around 
the world at about 7 p.m. CST today. Tuesday. It will then start flooding the 
Internet with traffic as it tries to replicate itself, creating the 
equivalent of an overwhelming number of surfers hitting the Web at once.
Dave Power, senior vice president of technology at Reliant Communications, 
said nearly every Internet service provider is taking the threat seriously 
and will monitor it carefully as it develops. 
"At the end of our staff meeting today the message we all left with was, `Be 
prepared for the siege,'" Power said. 
Unlike a virus, which spreads when a user opens an e-mail attachment, Code 
Red is a self-propagating worm that spreads itself without human 
intervention. 
When Code Red first showed up earlier this month it infected more than 
250,000 systems in just nine hours, security officials say. It tried to shut 
down the White House's Web server by sending a flood of data requests its 
way, but officials changed the Internet Protocol address, the numeric 
reference to a computer's location on the Internet, of the White House site 
before the attack began. 
When the worm reactivates Tuesday tonight it could begin spreading more 
quickly, bringing sporadic but widespread Internet slowdowns and defacing Web 
pages. 
The potential threat to Internet service is so severe that several federal 
agencies and companies, including the FBI and Microsoft, held a joint press 
conference Monday. 
"The Internet has become indispensable to our national security and economic 
well-being," said Ron Dick, head of the National Infrastructure Protection 
Center, an arm of the FBI. "Worms like Code Red pose a distinct threat to the 
Internet." 
Code Red scans the Internet for Web servers, sending a string of code to 
those machines that takes up residence not in the hard drive but in the 
buffer memory where it is difficult to detect. The worm targets servers 
running Microsoft Windows NT and Windows 2000 with Internet Information 
Server, or IIS, software versions 4.0 and 5.0. 
The worm isn't likely to infect the computers most people have at home or on 
their desktops at work, but rather will infect Web servers, the powerful 
machines kept in air-conditioned data centers that let people view Web sites 
online. That means any sort of Web surfing, from checking e-mail to buying 
books online to looking up stock quotes, may be anywhere from significantly 
slow to nearly impossible. 
"So the ordinary person using a cable modem or DSL won't be infected, and 
they don't need to worry about their privacy or confidentiality," said Chris 
Pick, vice president of product strategy for Houston-based PentaSafe Security 
Technologies. "But they will notice that some of the Web sites they want to 
hit are either running slowly or are simply not available." 
Unlike an e-mail virus, which spreads when a user opens an e-mail attachment, 
Code Red is a self-propagating worm that spreads itself without human 
intervention. 
Code Red scans the Internet for Web servers, sending a string of code to 
those machines that takes up residence not in the hard drive, but in the 
buffer memory where it is difficult to detect. The worm targets servers 
running Microsoft's Internet Information Server, or IIS, software versions 
4.0 and 5.0. 
From within a server Code Red begins scanning a randomly generated list of 
Internet addresses to find another server to infect. If the infected server's 
default language is English, all Web pages served by that machine will be 
defaced with the message "HELLO! Welcome to http://www.worm.com! Hacked by 
Chinese!" 
Officials say they have not identified the author of the program, but its 
name is said to be a reference to a soda made by Mountain Dew that is popular 
with hackers, and the name is not a reference to "Red" China. 
Officials say they have not identified the author of the virus, but its name 
is said to be a reference to a popular soda made by Mountain Dew with hackers 
and not China. 
The real problems created by Code Red are not related to security or privacy 
issues, or even the Web page graffiti, but rather the amount of traffic that 
will be generated by hundreds of thousands of Web servers sending out data 
packets searching for other machines to infect. 
The first 19 days of a month the worm is set up to scan and infect, but from 
day 20 until day 27 the worm floods a certain Internet address -- in this 
case the White House Web server -- with information requests causing a 
denial-of-service attack. 
The White House changed its Internet address prior to the attack earlier this 
month and avoided being knocked out, but that didn't kill off Code Red. The 
worm has been sitting dormant on servers for the past two weeks, but when the 
date changes from 31st to the 1st, it will begin scanning for new hosts to 
infect again. 
A software patch to fix the Microsoft IIS program's vulnerability has been 
available since June, a few weeks after developers and security experts found 
the problem. Unfortunately, not enough system administrators and Web masters 
installed it before the outbreak. 
"Hacker groups in general are aware of these vulnerabilities, but they can be 
taken care of relatively easily with just a little vigilance," Pick said. 
Jeremy Hewlett, security administrator for Reliant Communications, said 
downloading the software patch should be the first priority for any system 
administrator. In addition to the Microsoft site, the National Infrastructure 
Protection Center, www.nipc.gov, and Symantec Co., www.symantec.com cq for 
both addresseshave information about detecting and removing the worm. 
Observers say Microsoft products are common targets for virus writers because 
the software is found running on so many sites and because Microsoft has not 
always been as attentive to security issues as it could be. 
"With Windows NT and Windows 2000 they were engineered to work in tandem with 
a lot of other systems at once, so security was not engineered into the 
products from the start," Pick said. "They haven't focused on it much in the 
past but are starting to become more aware of it." 
Microsoft is known for not testing its products as well as it could either, 
Power said, which also leads to many post-release patches and updates. 
"They're not very forthcoming with problems, which is why you'll see most 
people go to the public and press with issues first," Power said. 
Microsoft took part in the public warnings about Code Red on Monday and has 
been providing the patch for free on its Web site for weeks. 
Hewlett said the staff at Reliant Communications has already cleared its 
network of the worm but is expecting to work late Tuesday night monitoring 
incoming attacks from other infected servers. University networks are among 
some of the likely breeding grounds since schools' Information Technology 
departments tend to be particularly short-staffed in the summers. 
"We saw enormous volumes of traffic from the schools last time, but nobody 
really monitors the university networks for this," he said. 
While the denial-of-service attack aimed at the White House could have been 
damaging if it had not been redirected in time, there's nothing stopping a 
virus writer from setting his or her sights on another target, like a 
company's Web site. 
"It could be Enron's site, it could be any other government site, or any part 
of the net's infrastructure that's vital to the economy," Pick said. "Houston 
is just as likely as any other city to be infected."

Calif Gov Spokesman Says He Bought Calpine Stock In June

07/30/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- A spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis purchased shares of 
Calpine Corp (CPN) on June 20, 2001, he said Monday, but declined to say how 
many shares he purchased. 
This is the first time an official in Davis' office has admitted to 
purchasing shares in energy companies since the state took on the job of 
buying power in January in lieu of the utilities.
As reported, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has been 
investigating Davis administration officials for more than a month to see if 
they purchased stock in energy companies using information that was 
unavailable to the public. Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said, however, that 
his stock holdings did
not represent a conflict of interest. Maviglio has not been named in the
SEC investigation, and says he made his purchases based on public
information. 

"There's no crime in owning energy company stocks," Maviglio said. "My 
purchase of Calpine was based on information I read in the newspapers." 
Maviglio also owns between $10,001-$100,000 in Enron Corp (ENE) stock, 
according to a 2000/2001 financial disclosure form. He said he has owned 
Enron stock since 1996. 

Last week, five state energy consultants were fired by Davis' staff for 
conflicts of interest because they helped California buy power from Calpine, 
a company in which they owned stock, state officials said. 
The consultants, who were hired by the state in January, did not file 
economic interest statements until July, when Secretary of State Bill Jones 
revealed that the consultants and energy traders held stocks in energy 
companies they were buying from. Jones said Monday that Maviglio's actions 
were "unethical, unconscionable and unacceptable." 
"The Governor should direct all of his staff to immediately file updated 
conflict of interest statements to reflect current holdings and any activity 
since their last Statement of Economic Interests was filed," Jones said in a 
statement. Jones, a Republican who hopes to challenge Democrat Davis next 
year for governor and who has been highly critical of Davis' handling of the 
energy crisis, also called for an expansion of investigations. 
"The SEC, the Attorney General and the Fair Political Practices Commission 
must now expand their investigations to include all of the Governor's staff 
in addition to the consultants who are already under investigation," the 
statement said. 
Attorney General Bill Lockyer has not yet decided whether he will launch an 
investigation into the Davis administration, a Lockyer spokeswoman said. 
The governor's own investments are in a blind trust, meaning a trustee 
handles Davis' financial affairs and the governor has no knowledge of the 
investments. 
"I have always owned mutual funds and have never bought stock in individual 
companies. That has been my policy since the beginning of my administration," 
Davis said Monday at a bill-signing event in Los Angeles. 
State conflict-of-interest laws say that public officials cannot negotiate 
contracts for companies in which they hold stock, and officials cannot use 
their positions to influence the state's decisions with respect to those 
companies. 
The conflict-of-interest laws apply to all state bodies, including the 
California Public Utilities Commission and the California Independent System 
Operator, which runs the state's real-time energy market. 
The five members of the ISO Board of Governors listed no holdings in energy 
companies since Jan. 24 on their most recent disclosure forms, signed between 
Jan. 24-July 24. The board was appointed by Davis in January. Disclosure 
forms for the CPUC and employees with the California Department of Water 
Resources, the state's power-buying arm, could not be immediately obtained. 
SEC investigators said Sunday that a preliminary investigation has revealed 
that several employees and consultants working directly with Davis on energy 
issues have purchased "significant" shares of Calpine stock between January 
and July. Individuals purchased stocks in other energy companies, but 
invested heavily in Calpine, the investigators said. Nearly half of the 
state's $43 billion in long-term energy pacts will come from Calpine, 
according to details of contracts released last month. Some of the contracts 
were signed as early as February, but Davis had refused to release the 
details of the supply until a Superior Court Judge ordered the administration 
to do so in mid-June after news organizations filed a lawsuit. 
Davis has accused power suppliers of price gouging, and his attorney general 
hopes to send power company executives to jail. But Davis has spared Calpine 
the invective, touting the San Jose-based generator as a "California company" 
helping to keep the lights on in the state. 
Maviglio has said the governor has praised Calpine because its prices are 
well below those charged by other generators and because the company has 
invested in California for the long haul. 
Calpine is "not attempting to suck every dime out of the state and throw 
parties in Houston," he said.

Functioning In The Bandwidth Market No One Expected
By Erwin Seba
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

07/30/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Band-X Ltd., the longest-lived bandwidth exchange, has 
survived by moving as the market has developed, said a London-based analyst 
of the London-based company. 
"Their business model is sound," Ciara Ryan, senior manager in the bandwidth 
trading department at Arthur Andersen's London office, told Dow Jones 
Newswires. "They understand the limitations of the market. They didn't try to 
fix the world overnight."
Band-X began trading bandwidth in 1997, two years before Enron Corp. (ENE), 
announced it was going to be a market-maker in bandwidth trading. 
But, a company executive said part of the reason for his company's success is 
it lacks an energy- merchant background. 
"The difference between gas and bandwidth is you can't store bandwidth," 
Donald Noonan, vice president of Networks, told Dow Jones. In 2000, the 
privately held company saw $80 million in bandwidth trades, Noonan said. 
The company has offices across Europe, Asia and in the U.S. 
The company also operates a telecommunications minutes exchange and a 
colocation exchange, which is increasing business as companies seek to gain 
some return on an investment in a network with rapidly declining profit 
potential, while others seek to buy or lease what they would otherwise build. 
"We are constantly seeing the leasing of capacity," Noonan said. 
But the contract time periods are shifting from the previously common 20-year 
lease to 1-year or 10- or 20-year contracts, he said. 
And the company has won favorable reviews from the most conservative part of 
the market, the carriers, Ryan said. 
"They have a lot critical mass and lot of support in the marketplace," she 
said.

INDIA: India evaluating Enron's offer to quit Dabhol.

07/30/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW DELHI, July 30 (Reuters) - Indian officials said on Monday they were 
evaluating an offer by U.S. energy firm Enron to sell its stake in troubled 
Dabhol power project to the federal government. 
A spokesman for the Dabhol Power Company, in which Enron holds a 65-percent 
stake, said on Saturday the firm and its partners wanted to sell equity in 
the project to the federal government or the lenders.
"We are assessing the situation. It is too premature to say anything right 
now," a senior federal power ministry official, who did not want to be 
identified, told Reuters. 
He said the federal government had not received any formal offer from Enron 
to sell its equity in the controversial project. 
Government sources said that ministry officials were talking to Indian 
financial institutions to assess Enron's statement. 
A power ministry official said if the federal government picked up Enron's 
equity in the project, it could save the government millions of dollars in 
penalties which it would have to pay if it lost an arbitration case over the 
project. 
Apart from Enron, DPC's shareholders include U.S. group General Electric and 
Bechtel, which own 10 percent each, and a local utility, the Maharashtra 
State Electricity Board (MSEB), which holds 15 percent. 
Enron has been locked in a bitter payment dispute with MSEB, which had signed 
a contract to buy all the power produced by Dabhol, whose first phase of 740 
MW was completed last year, and the second phase of 1,444 MW is nearly 
complete. 
A BLESSING 
India's western state of Maharashtra, where the project is located, welcomed 
Enron's offer to sell its equity in the controversial project, the Press 
Trust of India reported. 
"It will be God's biggest blessing for us," the agency quoted the state's 
Energy Minister Padamsinh Patil as saying in Bombay. 
It also quoted the head of a negotiating committee, M. Godbole as saying that 
the panel's next meeting, scheduled after a month, would be cancelled in view 
of Enron's statement that it wants to exit Dabhol. 
MSEB and Enron's dispute escalated in April, when the U.S. firm notified the 
government it was applying to an arbitration court in London to consider its 
claim for 1.02 billion rupees owed by MSEB for power it purchased in December 
from DPC. 
The company also sent a political force majeure notice to MSEB. Such a notice 
is a contractual clause dissatisfied parties give as a first step towards 
possibly dissolving a contract. 
In May, the defaulting utility stopped buying power from Dabhol, saying it 
was expensive.

California Governor's Spokesman Says He Bought Calpine Stock

California Governor's Spokesman Says He Bought Calpine Stock

     Sacramento, California, July 30 (Bloomberg) -- A spokesman
for California Governor Gray Davis said bought $12,000 worth of
stock in energy producer Calpine Corp. in June as the state was
working with the company to open new power plants and buying
millions of dollars a day in electricity.
     Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio purchased 300 shares of
Calpine on June 20 after putting in an order on May 31 to buy the
stock when it fell to $40, he said. The purchase is being reviewed
by the Governor's legal office, Maviglio said.
     ``These purchases were based on no knowledge of anything,
just public information about a growing California company,''
Maviglio said. ``I've informed the governor, the chief of staff
and our legal counsel today. I'd be glad to divest myself if
that's what required.''
     Maviglio also said he owns between $10,000 and $100,000 in
Enron Corp. shares, which he said he purchased in 1996. His
purchases came to light three days after California officials said
they fired five consultants hired to advise California on energy
after they disclosed that they owned shares of Calpine.
     The consultants worked for the Department of Water Resources,
which at the time was buying millions in electricity from Calpine
and other energy generators. California has spent almost $8
billion buying electricity for its two largest utilities, which
have been insolvent since January.
     Nine energy consultants were ordered by Davis's lawyer Barry
Goode last week to sell any energy-company stock they owned,
including shares of Enron Corp., Calpine Corp., and Dynegy Inc.,
after Secretary of State Bill Jones pressured Davis to release
details of their holdings.
     Jones said today in a statement that Maviglio should be fired
for the purchases.
     ``These actions are unethical, unconscionable, unacceptable
and heads should role,'' Jones said. ``Mr. Maviglio should be
fired immediately.''
     Jones has publicly called on Davis to force the 50
consultants hired by the state to disclose their holdings in
energy companies. Last week he urged the Securities and Exchange
Commission to investigate whether any of the consultants or
advisers traded stock based on non-public information.
     Maviglio said no one in the administration or at the
Department of Water Resources had been contacted by the SEC. ``No
one's been contacted either here or at DWR,'' Maviglio said.
     A spokeswoman for the SEC in San Francisco, Helane Morrison,
said the agency would not confirm or deny an investigation.
     Calpine shares are down 6.8 percent since June 20, when
Maviglio says he purchased the shares.

Best of the Web Today - January 21, 2002
By JAMES TARANTO
Left-Wing Rag or Right-Wing Gag?

On Friday, acting on a tip from reader Gregory Brunt, we noted that The Nation had published an article on its Web site by  Matt Bivens  http://opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95001749#matt , the very first sentence of which contained a major factual error:

*** QUOTE ***

When George W. Bush co-owned the Houston Astros and construction began on a new stadium, Kenneth Lay agreed to spend $100 million over thirty years for rights to name the park after Enron.

*** END QUOTE ***

Bush, of course, was part-owner of the Texas Rangers, not the Astros. Almost immediately after we published Friday's column, The Nation fixed the error. Or at least it tried. As  The Weekly Standard  http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/000/804gwezk.asp  notes, here's how the modified sentence read:

*** QUOTE ***

When George W. Bush co-owned the Texas Rangers and construction began on a new stadium, Kenneth Lay agreed to spend $100 million over thirty years for rights to name the park after Enron.

*** END QUOTE ***

Alas for The Nation, this was no more accurate.  Enron Field  http://www.ballparks.com/baseball/national/bpkaus.htm  is where the Astros play; the Rangers' home is the  Ballpark in Arlington  http://www.ballparks.com/baseball/american/bpkarl.htm , which has no corporate sponsor. Bivens also screwed up the chronology. Bush sold his interest in the Rangers in 1998; Enron bought naming rights to the Astros' new stadium in 1999. So an accurate version of Bivens's lead would have read:

*** QUOTE ***

A year after George W. Bush sold his interest in the Texas Rangers, construction began on a new stadium for the Houston Astros, and Kenneth Lay agreed to spend $100 million over thirty years for rights to name the latter team's park after Enron.

*** END QUOTE ***

That, of course, does not reflect badly--or indeed, in any way at all--on President Bush, though the incident reflects terribly on the bush-league journalism they practice at The Nation. Apparently the magazine's editors agree; by Saturday afternoon the Bivens piece had disappeared from their Web site (though the  modified version  http://www.thenation.com/cgi-bin/htsearch?config=&restrict=&exclude=&method=and&format=builtin-long&sort=score&words=houston+astros  still shows up in The Nation's search engine).

We all make mistakes, but this is only the latest in a string of staggeringly stupid stumbles by Nation editors and writers that we've chronicled in recent months:
- Katrina vanden Heuvel  http://opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95000919#katrina , editor-in-chief of this political magazine, appeared on national television and could not name her own congressman.
-Columnist  Eric Alterman  http://opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95000740#eric  apparently borrowed a phrase from George Will in 1989--then, 12 years later, accused Will of plagiarizing him.
-Just two weeks after Sept. 11, columnist  Katha Pollitt  http://opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95001214#katha  wrote a piece in which she boasted of her contempt for the American flag.

How could anyone be this dumb? Well, remember David Brock? Back in the early '90s he was the star reporter for The American Spectator, a conservative magazine. He turned out to be a liberal saboteur, and, as erstwhile Spectatorian  Byron York  http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/2001/11/york.htm  reported recently in The Atlantic Monthly, he ended up all but destroying the Spectator. Is it possible that The Nation, that venerable left-wing magazine, has been infiltrated by right-wing moles who are acting like idiots in an effort to discredit the left?

We'd like to go on the record opposing this kind of deception. If vanden Heuvel, Alterman, Pollitt, et al. really are right-wingers, they should come clean and engage their ideological opponents in an honest debate. This sort of deception is juvenile and contemptible, and it's especially inappropriate now. After all, there's a war on.

noted Thursday  http://opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95001739#krugman  a curious report in the New York Times that Times columnist Paul Krugman had once received $50,000 for serving on an Enron "advisory board."  Andrew Sullivan  http://andrewsullivan.com/  smells scandal. But he's overreacting. Based on what we know so far, Krugman's conduct looks foolish but not unethical.

Sullivan has done a manful job of trying to come up with an ethical transgression, unearthing an article Krugman wrote for  Fortune  http://www.wws.princeton.edu/%7Epkrugman/eman.html  while still on the Enron payroll in 1999. It's a puff piece on Enron, and it stands in sharp contrast with Krugman's current views on the subject, most notably  his column of last Friday  http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/18/opinion/18KRUG.html  (Times links require registration), in which he rails against the company as a symbol of the corruption of American capitalism.

But whatever the merits of Krugman's views, before or after the turn of the century, he does seem to have complied with the rules of journalistic ethics. He disclosed his relationship with Enron in the Fortune piece and again in a  January 2001 Times column  http://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/24/opinion/24KRUG.html . When he joined the Times as a columnist in 1999, he gave up the Enron gig, as the Times' conflict-of-interest policy requires.

Sullivan thinks Krugman should also have disclosed the amount of his fee, for "being on an advisory board need not be a source of payment." This seems an exceedingly picayune point, especially for someone who styles himself the scourge of " gotcha journalism  http://thenewrepublic.com/070901/trb070901.html ." Does anyone serve on an advisory board for a for-profit company without compensation? In any case, Sullivan's beef here ought to be not with Krugman but with his editors at Fortune and the Times, who surely knew enough to ask about the fee and insist on disclosure if they thought it necessary.

Krugman's own defense  http://www.wws.princeton.edu/%7Epkrugman/enron.html  is awfully, well, defensive, though at least his self-esteem seems healthy:

*** QUOTE ***

I was not an unknown college professor. On the contrary, I was a hot property, very much in demand as a speaker to business audiences: I was routinely offered as much as $50,000 to speak to investment banks and consulting firms. They thought I might tell them something useful. For what it's worth, Citibank officials said--you can check it out with a Nexis search--that a heads-up I gave them in 1996 about the risks of an Asian currency crisis saved them hundreds of millions of dollars.

*** END QUOTE ***

"Hot property" or not, Krugman does look quite silly thumping his chest about " crony capitalism  http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/15/opinion/15KRUG.html " when he himself has benefited from it and was cheering for today's villains less than three years ago. But being silly has never, as far as we know, disqualified anyone from writing a column for the New York Times.

Medal of Dishonor for America West  http://www.washtimes.com/national/20020119-79003878.htm

Joseph Foss got hassled by security guards at Phoenix's Sky Harbor International Airport last week. These days that's nothing unusual, but Foss is 86. He is a former governor of South Dakota and a retired Marine general. And what made the crack security staff for  America West  http://www.americawest.com/  suspicious was the Medal of Honor he earned in 1943 for his service in the Pacific theater.

"I was held up for 45 minutes, while they decided what to do about the medal," Foss tells the Washington Times. "I almost missed my flight, as they went back and forth." Foss earned the medal for shooting down 26 enemy planes. Good thing he didn't tell the guards that, or they'd never have let him fly.

Yasser, That's the Ticket--III  http://www.haaretzdaily.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=119598

Secretary of State Colin Powell "made a renewed demand on Sunday that Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat explain the arms shipment intercepted by the [Israeli Defense Force] in the Red Sea on January 3," the Israeli newspaper Ha'aretz reports. Pretty tough talk, there, Colin. What'll he do next, threaten to hold his breath until Yasser fesses up?

Actually, Arafat has an explanation: "The Karine A was operated by an Israeli company importing building materials from Romania," Arafat told Egyptian television, according to the  Jerusalem Post  http://www.jpost.com/Editions/2002/01/20/LatestNews/LatestNews.41965.html . In the Saudi daily  Arab News  http://www.arabnews.com/Article.asp?ID=12130 , meanwhile, Abdul Rahman Al-Rashid offers this advice for the Palestinian Arab strongman:

*** QUOTE ***

Arafat should have handled the issue as the former American President Bill Clinton did regarding his involvement with Monica Levinsky [sic]. While admitting that he had some kind of relationship with the girl, Clinton denied having had illicit relations with her. Thus he brought half the issue under control. He did not deny all the charges but neither did he tell the whole truth.

*** END QUOTE ***

OK, guys, these are improving--but  our readers' explanations  http://opinionjournal.com/columnists/jtaranto/?id=95001721  are still funnier.

Where's Churchill When You Need Him?  http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/allnews/page.cfm?objectid=11553940&method=full

It's just sad to see what's happened to the British. The orgy of vulgar sentimentality after Princess Diana's death a few years back made us suspect that the land of the stiff upper lip had somehow turned into a nation of hysterical ninnies. Now we're sure of it, notwithstanding even Tony Blair's resolute support in the terror war.

The U.S. military released some photos of terrorist captives at Guamtanamo Bay--a group that apparently includes three British citizens--and the sob sisters in the British press went into a frenzy of outrage. The Mirror, a London-based tabloid, shrieks that the "barbaric treatment" of the prisoners "is no more than a sick attempt to appeal to the worst red-neck prejudices." That must be why they're getting bagels and cream cheese.

The folks at the  BBC  http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/americas/newsid_1771000/1771687.stm  were more restrained, but the message was the same. In a dispatch last night titled "Prison Camp Pictures Spark Protests," the network reports: "The US Government has released photographs of the Taleban and al-Qaeda suspects held at its prison camp in Cuba which show them being subjected to sensory deprivation. . . . The chief medical officer of the human rights group, Amnesty International, Jim West, said the photographs were reminiscent of torture methods used in eastern Europe in the 1970s."

A  BBC report  http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/uk_politics/newsid_1773000/1773143.stm  from this afternoon, however, tells a different story:

*** QUOTE ***

The three British al-Qaeda suspects being held at Camp X-Ray in Cuba have "no complaints" about their treatment, according to British officials who have seen them.

The three are in "good physical health" and are being treated well, they reported.

*** END QUOTE ***

Oh well, never mind.

Big Man on Campus  http://www.miami.com/herald/content/news/national/digdocs/106181.htm

The Miami Herald reports from Gitmo that "a beefy, one-legged inmate tried to use Muslim prayer time to unite his fellow al Qaeda and Taliban prisoners." Military police "observed the prisoner facing the wrong way during Muslim prayer and chanting in Arabic what a linguist translated as, 'Be strong. Allah will save us.' " Army Capt. Luis Hernandez "described the one-legged prisoner as 'fat and strong' while 'the little kids are coming very skinny.' "

Onward? Not This Christian Soldier.  http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/uk_politics/newsid_1771000/1771086.stm

Rowan Williams, the archbishop of Wales, is denouncing the war on terrorism as "tainted." In an essay reprinted in today's  Guardian  http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,3604,636690,00.html , he suggests that the American campaign in Afghanistan is morally equivalent to the attack on the World Trade Center:

*** QUOTE ***

It is just possible to deplore civilian casualties and retain moral credibility when an action is clearly focused and its goals are on the way to evident achievement. It is not possible when the strategy appears confused and political leaders talk about a "war" that may last years. And there is a fine line between, for example, the crippling of military and aircraft installations and the devastating of an infrastructure with a half-formed aim of destroying morale. Combine that with the use of anti-personnel weapons such as cluster bombs, which ought to raise some serious questions (they have been described as aerial landmines in terms of their randomly lethal character), and the whole enterprise is tainted.

Tainted, because as soon as assaults on public morale by allowing random killing as a matter of calculated policy become part of a military strategy, we are at once vulnerable to the charge that there is no moral difference in kind between our military action and the terror that it attacks.

*** END QUOTE ***

Williams is not so much turning the other cheek as being two-faced. He tells the  Telegraph  http://www.portal.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2002/01/21/narch21.xml  that he didn't really mean that America is guilty of terrorism:

*** QUOTE ***

The 51-year-old Primate of Wales agreed that terrorism was an evil that had to be rooted out, but said: "I don't think you root out terrorism by reproducing its methods. And that's always the danger if we respond in some ways hastily.

"I didn't say that the American campaign was morally equivalent to terrorism, just that there were certain possible tactics in that campaign which would leave them open to that charge."

*** END QUOTE ***

Williams also writes (in a passage quoted by the Telegraph but not reprinted in the Guardian) that he was near ground zero on Sept. 11, and "I know just a little of what it is like for so many human beings--Israelis and Palestinians now, and Iraqis a few years ago." How about Americans?

Anthrax Breakthrough?  http://www.cnn.com/2002/US/01/21/anthrax.probe/index.html

"Investigators appear to be on the verge of cracking the genetic sequencing of the anthrax strain that has killed five Americans since the fall," CNN reports. "Discovering the genetic sequencing could reveal the age of the deadly strain sent in the letters and may lead investigators to the laboratory or laboratories where it was produced, sources said."
 
The  Hartford Courant  http://www.ctnow.com/news/specials/hc-detrick0120.artjan20.story?coll=hc-headlines-home  reports that anthrax specimens disappeared from the Army's biological- warfare research facility at Fort Detrick, Md., in the early 1990s, "during a turbulent period of labor complaints and recriminations among rival scientists there." A 1992 Army inquiry "found evidence that someone was secretly entering a lab late at night to conduct unauthorized research, apparently involving anthrax. A numerical counter on a piece of lab equipment had been rolled back to hide work done by the mystery researcher, who left the misspelled label 'antrax' in the machine's electronic memory, according to the documents obtained by The Courant."

The Courant adds that "Fort Detrick is believed to be the original source of the Ames strain of anthrax used in the mail attacks last fall."

Huh?  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A9869-2002Jan20.html

Bill Clinton was in Saudi Arabia over the weekend, and the Washington Post reports he weighed in against withdrawing U.S. troops from the corrupt and repressive kingdom. The Post's report contains three quotes from the peripatetic past prez:

*** QUOTE ***

"There are not so many [U.S. military] people here as to constitute a sort of occupation or anything like that. That's not the purpose of it."

"It is correct to say it is not just in this region. We have systems in the military. We review everything every four years and then they [the Saudis] have systems within every four-year period to review other things."

"Look at our forces in Asia and even in Latin America. It is a function of what we might be asked to do and being able to do it by having some people there physically present."

*** END QUOTE ***

These quotes are remarkable, of course, for the absence of first-person singular pronouns. But can anyone figure out what the heck Clinton is saying?

Somali Folly  http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/ap/20020118/en/black_hawk_down_boycott_1.html

Somali-American "community leaders" in Minneapolis--home of America's biggest concentration of Somali immigrants--are calling for a boycott of " Black Hawk Down  http://www.spe.sony.com/movies/blackhawkdown/ ," "charging the new movie depicts their African homeland's people as savages and could create a backlash against refugees who fled to the United States," the Associated Press reports.

"The Somali people are depicted as very savage beasts without any human element," Omar Jamal of the St. Paul-based Somali Justice Advocacy Center, tells the AP. "I's just people shooting each other.''

People shooting each other? In a war movie? This is shocking! It's not totally unheard of, though. A few years ago, we went to see "Saving Private Ryan," and it, too, featured people shooting each other. How come German-Americans didn't boycott?

Stupidity Watch  http://www.industryclick.com/magazinearticle.asp?magazineid=17&releaseid=9774&magazinearticleid=138367&siteid=5

National Hog Farmer ("The Pork Business Authority") reports that RFK's son has gone off the deep end:

*** QUOTE ***

In the mind of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., corporate pork production is a greater threat to American life and liberty than terrorist Osama bin Laden.

"This threat is greater than that in Afghanistan," says Kennedy. "This is not only a threat to the environment, it is a threat to the American economy and democracy."

*** END QUOTE ***

Kennedy told a crowd of "anti-agriculture activists and college students" that "closing the last family farm is like tearing out the last pages of the last Bible, Torah or Talmud." Why, we wonder, didn't he mention the Koran?

Several readers took issue with our  Friday smiting  http://opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95001749#stupidity  of Paul Campos over his phrase tofu Taliban. We take the point, which Jeff Arnett put best:

*** QUOTE ***

While I generally concur with you when you identify the overzealous and wrongheaded among us who compare the tactics of the murderous Taliban to irritating but otherwise rather innocuous behaviors, I think a little context is sometimes in order.

You describe Paul Campos's little diatribe as "preposterously overwrought." If he were being totally serious, I'd agree. But it seems in this more tongue-in-cheek context, the humor he's injected makes this comparison no more egregious than the infamous "Soup Nazi" character from the old Seinfeld television series: a metaphor that everyone understood was never meant to be taken literally, so it was perceived as hysterically funny at the time.

Have things changed so much that we've lost our sense of humor? If so, perhaps the terrorists have won . . . heh, heh, heh!

*** END QUOTE ***

This House Isn't a Home
In a  Friday item  http://opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95001749#notnice , we got Robin Cook's title wrong. He is Britain's leader of the house, not home secretary.

"Attorneys Seek Bail for Ex-SLA Soldiers," reads a headline in Friday's Oakland (Calif.) Tribune. Apparently the folks at the Trib think the Symbionese Liberation Army was an actual army, rather than a terrorist organization.

Enron's Bonds Tell the Tale: Stay Away
By Herb Greenberg <<mailto:hgreenberg@thestreet.com>>
Senior Columnist
RealMoney.com
10/24/2001 03:40 PM EDT
URL: <<http://www.thestreet.com/p/rmoney/herbonthestreet-rm/10002953.html>>

Updated from 2:47 p.m. EDT 
If you ever have questions about whether a battered stock is cheap, check out its bonds. Bond analysts almost always know best because they're looking at the guts of a company -- the ability of a company to service its debt. If it can't service the debt, stockholders are at a greater risk of getting pummeled because debtholders always come before stockholders when it comes to getting paid. 
Which brings us to Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) . The only reason to mention it is that some analysts are really reiterating buys based on its low multiple. (Low, fellas, is relative to reality!) Cramer today talks about his hunch that the stock is vulnerable because, as he says, "accounting irregularities = sell." 
Good point. Now let's back that up with the bond market's view, which can be seen in the so-called "swap spread," which is bond-traderspeak for the spread between the LIBOR interest rate and the interest rate for comparable paper, or swaps. It's a benchmark bond traders use to determine risk. Tuesday, that spread on Enron's five-year notes was 650 basis points, or about 6.5 percentage points. Today, it's 1,000 points, or 10 percentage points. As one bond trader told me today, anybody would be crazy to pay that much. Another bond trader told another friend the same thing. 
Why? As of June 30, Enron had cash of just $847 million and debt of nearly $13 billion. 
And this observation: Those five-year notes currently yield more than 11%. That's a junk-bond yield for what is still rated as an investment-grade debt; anything more than 9% is considered ultra-high risk. So while you can make 11%, that's still not enough "where the accounting is questionable," one bond trader says. "You're not being adequately compensated for the fact that the company could default. You have to worry about your recovery value." 
Not the kind of risk/reward an investor wants to see when the company in question still has a market cap of about $12.5 billion with a capital B. 
Speaking of bonds and stocks: Even with its stock at about $1.16, Global Crossing (GX:NYSE - news - commentary) still has a market cap that exceeds $1 billion. But while its stock has rallied, its bank debt has stayed relatively flat at around 50 cents to 53 cents on the dollar. Similar stories can be told for XO Communications (XOXO:Nasdaq - news - commentary) , with a market cap of about $473 million and bank debt trading at around 52 cents on the dollar; Level 3 Communications (LVLT:Nasdaq - news - commentary) , with a market cap of $1.2 billion and bank debt trading at 66 cents; and McLeodUSA (MCLD:Nasdaq - news - commentary) , with a market cap of $462 million and debt that trades at 53 cents. 
Where are opportunistic bond investors, who should be hopping on such cheap debt -- especially bank debt, which is at the top of the getting-paid-back food chain? They're nowhere to be seen, for the same reasons they're not jumping to buy Enron's bonds: Too much risk, because when companies like those go bad, their assets trade for less than the bonds are currently trading. (Try telling that to "hope-springs-eternal" stock investors!) 
Providian pratfalls: Turns out an item here back in May was more fortuitous than it appeared. The item noted how institutional bond investors, who often pony up a slight premium to LIBOR to buy so-called credit default-protection insurance, couldn't find any at any price for Providian (PVN:NYSE - news - commentary) . The insurance is sold by investment banks such as J.P. Morgan Chase and typically involves a complex hedge of stocks and options that requires an investor to take the other side of the trade. If nobody'll take the other side of the trade -- or will charge a ridiculously high price to do so -- investors should beware. Which brings us back to Enron: It is possible to buy credit insurance, but at more than a whopping 1,000 basis points over LIBOR. Hardly a vote of confidence.

Accounting irregularities = sell. Those three words and an equals sign have always served me well. They remain squarely posted on the base of my quote machine, always in view. They have never let me down. When I have deviated from them I have had to pay severely, as I did when I ignored the accounting irregularities in Cendant (CD:NYSE - news - commentary) initially or when, because of my four-month holding period, I couldn't sell Qwest (Q:NYSE - news - commentary) . 
Which is why I came in with guns blazing on this Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) , telling you to sell it. The stock has now lost half its value and all I can say is, I still can't see why you have to tempt fate and own this one. The notion that the businesses are fundamentally sound, that it has a great core business, is just hokum. Who the heck knows? Who has any idea of what this company can really earn? Who knows what it did earn? 
All I know is that soon the drumbeat will be on from the Democrats that the Justice Department is playing political favorites by not pursuing Enron (noted Republican-giving company) for alleged fraud. 
When that happens, when that shoe drops, wherever Enron is, then maybe it is worth some scrutiny. 
But I bet I still won't like it. 


Enron's Excuses Sound Familiar

If you disclose something that is wrong, and you get accountants to check off that wrong deed, and outside lawyers to check off on that wrong deed, is it therefore right? 
That's what Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) is asking us to believe. By telling us that its ridiculous dealings with the chief financial officer and his private partnership were all sanctioned by outside professionals, they have simply compounded the error. Next they will tell us that Janus, the largest shareholder, knew and wanted those partnerships to generate upside surprises! 
What they are doing at Enron is, well, positively -- here we go -- '80s! In the '80s, you had all of these savings-and-loan jokers pleading that the outside accountants and lawyers checked off on massive chicanery. Somehow it was supposed to make the chicanery kosher. 
Nope. 
What it ended up doing was getting the lawyers and accountants in trouble. The government ended up going after them, too, for abetting the travesties. 
Enron didn't use taxpayers' money, so it is arguably not as clear-cut. But the more we probe this Enron, the more we check it out, the more we know it really stinks and that Jeffrey Skilling didn't leave because the stock got hammered, or some other authentic Wall Street gibberish, but because of this nasty, unseemly situation. 
We don't want an SEC probe here. We want a Justice Department probe. This isn't about unclear disclosure. This could end up being about fraud. 
In the meantime, I wouldn't touch this stock with a 10-foot pole. This one's gonna get real nasty before it gets nice. If it ever does. 

FOOL ON THE HILL 
Enron's Disdain for Investors 
The Motley Fool.com
10/24/01
While recent coverage of Enron centers on the CFO's past partnerships, a smaller -- and more obvious -- omission is what should really make individual investors turn the heat up on this company. Not only does it not release its cash flow statement during each quarter's conference call and press release, something we don't like but is prevalent, it also doesn't release its balance sheet. The company must think we're idiots. They're wrong. 
By Tom Jacobs <<http://www.fool.com/About/staff/tomj.htm>> (TMF Tom9) 
October 24, 2001 
Enron's (NYSE: ENE) <<http://quote.fool.com/uberdata.asp?symbols=ENE>> troubles just don't stop. On Monday, the company announced <<http://www.enron.com/corp/pressroom/releases/2001/ene/70-LJMfinalltr.html>> that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had requested information on "certain related party transactions <<http://www.fool.com/specials/2001/sp010802e.htm>>." That was a veiled reference to partnerships until recently organized and directed by Enron CFO Andrew Fastow. There has been a flurry -- a hailstorm -- of financial media attention to this. There are only three possibilities, and none is palatable:
The company's board allowed this deal in order to -- using corporate speak -- "incentivize" the CFO, and it was not legal; 
It was legal, but unethical; or 
Enron has been less than forthcoming, perpetuating a pattern of disdain for investors and keeping them in the dark. 
The accounting machinations involve mind-numbing terms and obfuscation, making a simple explanation of what is being alleged above my capacity to provide. The New York Times' Floyd Norris calls them "some of the most opaque transactions with insiders ever seen." That leads me to one conclusion when I think about burying myself with the company's SEC filings, accounting texts, my high-speed Web connection, and some beer: that of Shakespeare's King Lear -- "that way madness lies." 
On the one hand, I know that pulling all this apart might teach me useful things about accounting, reading financial statements, and finding trouble. (To read what this is all about, check the "Certain Transactions" section of the company's latest proxy statement <<http://quote.fool.com/sec/sec.asp?date=03/27/2001&currTicker=ene&symbols=ene&guid=%7B5D0F1D1D%2D5DB7%2D4F4E%2D9BD9%2DFA154603F662%7D>>.) I fully intend to do that -- someday. For now, though, all I need to know about Enron as an investment is that the company has not made these issues transparent.
What's worse, though, is that Enron has made it a habit to keep investors in the dark, and not only about the potentially troublesome CFO issue. The company goes out of its way to hide its true financials. That really cheeses me off.
The quarterly call and press release parade
Most companies hold quarterly conference calls and simultaneously spew press releases (for which the companies pay good money to Business Wire and PR Newswire for dissemination) that allegedly state their latest quarter's numbers and talk about the business. Sometimes, when they have cleaned off their glasses enough for visibility and run it by their lawyers, execs will even venture to speak about the business climate ahead. At least thanks to Regulation Fair Disclosure <<http://www.fool.com/Specials/2001/sp010418.htm>> -- "Reg. FD" -- analysts don't get a secret call with the "real" numbers at another time than the public. We like that.
Perhaps in a world of pro forma numbers <<http://aol.fool.com/portfolios/rulemaker/2001/rulemaker010815.htm>> and EBITDA <<http://aol.fool.com/portfolios/rulemaker/2001/rulemaker010906.htm>> -- both of which Phil Weiss has skewered appropriately in past columns -- the calls and press releases could never be expected to be that substantive. That makes individual investors increasingly correct to greet such information with cries of "bullfeathers!" It only takes a few reviews of earnings press releases to make anyone a skeptic. The PR department carefully dresses them with spin, leaving the details for the fine print. Headline: "Earnings up!" (Revenues down 40%.) Headline: "Revenues up!" (Earnings down 40%.) The skullduggery of spin and pro forma mangles earnings to meaninglessness <<http://www.fool.com/news/foth/2001/foth010504.htm>>.
At least the conference calls themselves allow you a sense of managers as people and potentially some information about the business, but the financials are not helpful. Why? 
Hiding the cash flow statement
Because almost every company gives up only part of the financial picture at call and press release time. If the income statement is increasingly unhelpful, at least the balance sheet tells you whether the company has increased or decreased cash, right? Well, not quite.
You really need the cash flow statement -- the best measure of how the company's business actually performs. Even then, you may need to make further adjustments <<http://aol.fool.com/portfolios/rulemaker/2001/rulemaker010906.htm>>. Yet the overwhelming majority of companies do not provide the cash flow statement at the call and press release time. 
Check the companies you own. If they don't release cash flow statements with their earnings -- or, at least, prior to SEC filings, you should write and otherwise hound investor relations to push management to do so. Encourage your fellow investors to do so too, and tell the company that The Motley Fool sent ya. They will maintain that the numbers aren't ready at earnings time. Tell them to wait until they are. The numbers are certainly ready in time for the SEC deadline, and wouldn't we be happy to wait a week or two for the complete picture? Or, hey, why not do two releases -- one when the earnings are ready and another for the cash flow? 
If not releasing the cash flow statement were Enron's only sin, it wouldn't be that big a deal. It has plenty of company. But this pre-Halloween < <http://www.fool.com/specials/2001/sp011024.htm>> scary tale gets worse. Unfortunately for Enron investors, the company does the hide-the-cash-flow-statement gig one better.
Hiding the balance sheet
For at least the last three quarters that I checked, Enron hides the balance sheet until SEC filing time. That's right: Not just the cash flow statement, but the balance sheet too. All they release is the income statement -- though, in truth, it does provide pages of income statement information for its many businesses. But why fail to release the balance sheet?
The only conclusion can be that management doesn't want to show its cash balances until it can slip them into SEC filings it thinks people won't bother to read. When questioners on a conference call earlier this year urged former Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling to provide a balance sheet at earnings release, Skilling reportedly "called the questioner a common vulgarity that surprised many listeners."
Off his meds that day? Or a symptom of the company's attitude towards shareholders? Looks like the latter: Skilling's gone, but the practice hasn't changed. 
It's about management
We don't depend on management for the numbers during the quarterly public calls and releases. A publicly traded company's financials will appear a few weeks later through its SEC filings available through our Quotes & Data page <<http://quote.fool.com/>>. No investor should be buying -- or holding -- stock in companies if they don't read their filings carefully. It's hard enough to discern what's going on in a business without doing so, and even in those filings -- such as with options grants to management -- the real meat is buried in footnotes. Not reading 10-Qs and 10-Ks is like getting married without dating, or buying a car by paint color only.
What Enron's failure to release this information says is that its management and corporate governance are sub-par. It says management is willing to hold these events, but it'll be darned if it'll present anything meaningful or make it easy for individual investors to find out anything other than management's spin. In Enron's case, its former CEO heaped abuse on someone who dared ask for a change. Does that make Enron's earnings releases circuses? Draw your own conclusion.
Is management listening? Perhaps. It hastily pulled together a conference call yesterday. TMF community member emschulze took notes <<http://boards.fool.com/Message.asp?mid=15974151>>:
"On call, analyst asks why no balance sheet with recent earnings release given company's previous claim that it will work to offer investors greater transparency in measuring its performance... response was that balance sheet doesn't normally come together until the week after its earnings release and that it will be included in 10-Q to be filed by Nov. 14... CEO indicates that it will do a better job of improving timing of release of earnings and balance sheet in future, implying that investors won't have to wait all the way until 10-Q filing deadlines to see balance sheet."
That's a good sign. But until the company makes an unambiguous commitment to provide the balance sheet at earnings time, Enron should be in the doghouse. 
Good corporate governance means companies release all their quarterly financial statements and discuss them at the same time because today's income statements and pro forma numbers are borderline useless. If it means a delay or a second release to get the numbers together, what's the problem? Shareholders should demand no less. When a company trumpets an income statement, as Enron has, no one should be surprised when smoke appears. And perhaps much more.
Tom Jacobs (TMF Tom9) would like to improve his own cash flow statement. At press time, he owned no shares of Enron.

Bonds Of Troubled Enron Quoted In Dollars, Not Spreads
By Michael C. Barr

Of DOWJONES NEWSWIRES 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The bonds of embattled Enron Corp. (ENE) are trading on a dollar basis and not on a yield margin or spread to Treasurys - another sign of increasing investor skittishness about the once high flying energy trader.
The bonds, which carry investment-grade ratings, "started trading with a dollar price two days ago," said Gary Brown, managing director and head of corporate trading, Wachovia Securities, Charlotte, N.C. 
Bonds are being offered at dollar prices in the high 80's to low 90's, say traders. 
Investment grade bonds typically trade on a spread margin over comparable Treasury issues. "Credit bonds," which have questions about their quality, are traded in dollar quotes, said one analyst. 
Moody's Investors Service rates the company's senior unsecured debt Baa1, but recently placed the debt on review for downgrade. Both Standard & Poor's Corp. and Fitch rate the debt triple-B-plus. 
But the company "may be going into the double-B (non-investment grade) sector, " said Harold Rivkin, principal of H. Rivkin & Co., a distressed debt brokerage firm, Princeton, N.J. 
"I am starting to get inquiry from investment grade holders about the market for Enron bonds," Rivkin said, noting that some high-grade portfolios can't have paper below investment-grade. 
Houston-based Enron, the nation's biggest energy trader, recently announced a large third-quarter loss and an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission into a partnership arrangement that involves the company's chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow. 
Enron has approached Citicorp (C) about obtaining a possible $750 million loan, according to a source close to the bank. But the source indicated Tuesday that nothing has proceeded past the preliminary inquiry. 
The company's stock, while once a favorite of the investment community, has taken a pounding. It traded early this year at more than $80 a share. Late Wednesday, it was at $15.70 a share. 
And, in a reflection of current investor sentiment, for the second time this week analyst Carol Coale of Prudential Securities downgraded the company to a sell recommendation from a hold. Her concern is "not because of the things we know but because of the things that we potentially don't know."

USA: Group to put corporate directors under microscope.
By Kevin Drawbaugh

10/24/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
WASHINGTON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Directors of corporations will be graded according to their performance by a service expected to be launched soon by business research group The Corporate Library, the group's cofounder said on Wednesday. 
In a move that could cause some sweaty palms in boardrooms across the country, long-time shareholder activist Nell Minow said directors will be awarded grades of A, B, C and lower, based on meeting attendance and other benchmarks.
"It's always been my dream to rate individual directors like bonds. Directors have not had the scrutiny they deserve," said Minow, who said the service will be called Board Analyst. 
Planned as an added feature on an existing Web site, thecorporatelibrary.com, Board Analyst is still in testing stages but is expected to launch next year, she said. 
Only directors of U.S. companies will initially be evaluated. Non-U.S. directors may be added later. 
Minow and partner Robert Monks have written several books on corporate governance and shareholder rights. They formerly managed the Washington-based shareholder activist Lens Fund, which they sold last year to British fund management group Hermes. 
Their latest venture may find a receptive audience on the institutional buy-side, said industry spokespersons. 
"There's been growing interest within our membership in board membership, in general, and individual directors, in particular. I definitely think there would be interest in more information on individual directors," said Ann Yerger, spokeswoman for the Council of Institutional Investors, which represents America's large pension funds. 
The corporate governance movement since its beginnings in the 1970s has focused on making directors more accountable and responsible. Many companies have responded by requiring more outside directors and more meaningful stock ownership among directors. But examples of lax board oversight still abound. 
One example would be Enron Corp. , whose stock has plunged in recent days since the company said the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating transactions involving certain outside partnerships and the company's chief financial officer, Minow said. 
"Where was the Enron board in all of this?" she asked. "Boards and outside consultants are supposed to vet ideas for partnerships like these. That apparently didn't happen here." 
Taking the corporate governance argument a step further, Minow argued that effective board membership is more than a theoretical question. It should be an issue for investors to evaluate when they consider buying stock in a company. 
"This isn't just a corporate governance thing. This is part of investment analysis," she said. 
Institutional investors routinely examine corporate management when analyzing stocks. Whether they will begin to examine directors, as well, remained an open question. 
"Nell and Bob Monks have been shareholder activists for a long time and have moved corporate governance in a positive direction," said Peter Gleason, vice president of research and development at the National Association of Corporate Directors, which represents more than 3,000 corporate directors. 
Surveys by the association recently showed that corporate directors rank self-evaluation high on their list of concerns. "More and more directors are saying this is something we should be doing," Gleason said.

Calif Sen Pwr Probe Committee OKs Deposing Energy Execs ?????
Updated: Friday, July 20, 2001 08:16 AM?ET ????? 
?

(This article was originally published Thursday) 

By Jason Leopold 

OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--A California Senate committee investigating 
manipulation in the state's wholesale power market approved a measure late 
Thursday, authorizing the committee to depose the chief executives of major 
energy companies to provide insight into the companies' trading practices. 

The Senate Select Committee to Investigate Market Manipulation voted 28-6 in 
favor of deposing some of the energy sector's most powerful chief executives. 


The move comes a day after the committee held Reliant Energy Inc. (REI, news, 
msgs) and Enron Corp. (ENE, news, msgs) in contempt for refusing to provide 
documents on its electricity trading and sales practices. The full Senate is 
expected to vote on the contempt charge and decide the punishment to impose. 

Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, the committee chair, would have carte blanche to 
depose executives, such as Enron Chairman Ken Lay, who has been singled out 
by Attorney General Bill Lockyer for gouging consumers in the state. 

Representatives of the energy companies under investigation were not 
available for comment. 

The committee has been investigating whether energy companies knowingly 
manipulated the state's wholesale electricity market to drive up prices and 
create artificial shortages. 

It has yet to uncover a "smoking gun." But has secured the testimony of 
former Duke Energy (DUK, news, msgs) power plant employees who told the 
committee that the company reduced output at a San Diego power plant during 
power emergencies to drive up power prices. 

The state's Independent System Operator, however, conceded that it ordered 
the fluctuations in capacity at the power plant.

HEADLINE: Energy secretary, former Gov. Wilson speak on energy crisis

BYLINE: By Rick Jurgens

BODY:

??SAN FRANCISCO _ Two prominent Republicans came here on Thursday to promote
free-market solutions to the energy crisis that has hit California and 
threatens
to spread nationwide.

??Spencer Abraham, energy secretary in the Bush administration, only briefly
mentioned the state's current troubles and instead regaled 600 attendees at a
Bay Area Council banquet with the promises of new technologies.

??Earlier, former Gov. Pete Wilson focused on the past as he offered 90 people
at the Public Policy Institute of California a rambling defense of the 1996
electricity industry restructuring law he signed.

??At the heart of electricity industry restructuring is a traditional
Republican theme: a preference for market forces and competition over 
regulators
and government planning. But the fate of California's electricity industry
restructuring plan now rests in the hands of Gray Davis, the state's 
Democratic
governor. ?

??Abraham never mentioned Davis.

??"I didn't come here to play the blame game," he said in a news conference.

??California's electricity problems are merely the most intense in a nation
facing "rising demand, stagnant supplies and an energy (infrastructure) that 
is
out of date and in need of repair," he said.

??Picking up on an initiative that has emerged as a priority for some 
advocates
of restructuring, Abraham stressed the need for enhanced federal authority to
meld regional networks of high-voltage transmission lines into a national 
grid.

??But Abraham's main pitch was that California technology companies could
contribute "intellectual capital and ingenuity to the world of megawatts."

??Looking far into the new century, he offered a vision of an energy industry
replete with micro turbines, fuel cells and hybrid engines.

??"Our carbon-based economy itself may pass from the scene to be replaced,
perhaps, by a hydrogen- based economy," he said.

??Wilson's concerns were more prosaic. He defended restructuring _ now plagued
by soaring prices and rolling blackouts _ as a step forward from the previous
structure, where electricity came from regulated monopolies.

??"There were flaws," Wilson said of the restructuring bill that he signed 
into
law in 1996. "I acknowledge that. They were less important than launching
California on the path to deregulation."

??Restructuring was the only way to bring down power costs that were higher
than in other states, and to break a regulatory logjam that had limited power
plant development, he said.

??Wilson criticized the law's retail rate freeze. Although it triggered a
financial crisis for the state's utilities, the freeze was largely "a
self-inflicted wound," insisted upon by utilities seeking to be repaid for
costly investments in nuclear plants and contracts with small generators, he
said.

??Wilson also said it had been a mistake to forbid the utilities to sign
long-term contracts with generators. Those were ruled out because regulators
feared such contracts would give utilities an unfair advantage as competition
developed, he said.

??Noting that he had been singled out for criticism by Davis, Wilson fired
back, saying that Davis had been too slow to invoke the "virtually 
dictatorial"
powers that the governor has in emergencies, including electricity shortages.

??But Wilson expressed some sympathy for Davis, noting that the Legislature
would not have allowed faster power plant siting and construction without a
crisis.

??He also grudgingly complimented his successor's political skills.

??"I admire Gov. Davis' ability to conduct public relations," Wilson said,
noting that a visit by President George W. Bush had turned into an "absolute
public relations triumph for the governor."

??Wilson echoed some of Davis' themes. Under presidents Clinton and Bush, the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's response to the crisis had been "a bit
slow off the mark," Wilson said.

??There remain "unanswered questions" about the role of natural gas suppliers,
and whether shortages and high prices in California resulted from "artificial 
or
real constraints on pipeline capacity," he added.

??Generators, while not the cause of the crisis, should also be held to
account.

??"If people have been guilty of gouging, they should pay up," he said.

??Wilson said the current troubles are a symptom of the state's failure to 
plan
for growth. The electricity crisis "will be dwarfed in the future by a water
crisis," he warned.

HEADLINE: Edison Bailout Bills Remain Stalled

BYLINE: MIGUEL BUSTILLO, CARL INGRAM, TIMES STAFF WRITERS

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO

BODY:

??Leading lawmakers conceded they would probably leave on their summer break
without passing legislation aimed at rescuing Southern California Edison from
its financial straits as competing bailouts stalled in the Legislature 
Thursday.

??The Assembly is expected to consider one of two rival measures to save 
Edison
today, and the Senate is expected to take up an Edison rescue deal of its own.

??But all three pending measures face long odds and none have sufficient
support to clear both houses, legislative leaders said.

??With the Legislature set to quit for the summer as early as today, the
leaders predicted they would be forced to continue negotiations during the
monthlong recess in hopes of brokering a deal.

??"I can't imagine that in the next 24 hours" lawmakers will reach consensus 
on
an Edison rescue, said Assemblyman Fred Keeley (D-Boulder Creek), who 
coauthored
one of the lower house's rescue bills with Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg
(D-Sherman Oaks).

??One indication of the lack of enthusiasm for the legislation is that Keeley
himself does not support the measure that bears his name. "I don't believe 
that
this bill in its current form should become law," he said. "This bill is not
ready."

??The maneuvering in both houses Thursday capped a day of frenetic activity in
the state Capitol, which has become flooded with cell phone-carrying lobbyists
seeking to influence the Edison deal for seemingly every special interest in 
the
state.

??Yet amid the flurry of action, there seemed little chance of actually making
law. Many of the participants said the legislative debate appeared to be less 
an
attempt to pass a bill than a war of one-upsmanship between the houses to see
who could "lob a grenade" into the rival house and go home until August. That
way, if Edison soon winds up in Bankruptcy Court, leaders of each house could
argue they were not to blame.

??Hoping to head off a growing sentiment among lawmakers that bankruptcy may
not be such a bad alternative, Gov. Gray Davis spent the day working the 
phones
in hopes of persuading legislators that a government rescue of Edison would be
good for the state.

??To avoid mass blackouts, California has been purchasing billions of dollars
worth of electricity since the beginning of this year because the state's two
largest private utilities, Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric, are no longer
credit-worthy enough to buy power on behalf of their customers.

??The utilities lost that status and ran up billions in debt the last two 
years
because they were paying high prices for power on the wholesale market and 
could
not recover those costs from customers because of a state-imposed rate freeze.

??As a result, the state government is stuck in the power-buying business 
until
the utilities regain their financial footing--an expensive predicament that
threatens the state's financial health.

??Davis attempted to head off the crisis by negotiating rescues of the two
utilities, but PG&E lost faith in the talks and opted to take itself into
Bankruptcy Court in April, embarrassing the Democratic governor. 

??Days later, Davis reached a tentative rescue deal with Southern California
Edison. But the plan hit the Legislature with a thud amid concerns it was 
overly
generous to Edison, and it has languished for months.

??Last week, lawmakers finally picked up the pace and began moving forward 
with
a series of competing proposals to alter the governor's deal with Edison. But 
it
was clear from the outset that no consensus had emerged, and many lawmakers 
are
becoming convinced that legislative inaction--even if it means bankruptcy--may
be the best way to resolve Edison's financial predicament.

??"We're bailing out people who don't need to be bailed out," said Sen. Ross
Johnson (R-Irvine).

??Legislative leaders hoped to pass something before today when the Assembly
and Senate are scheduled to break for their traditional summer recess. The 
date
is considered important because Edison and Davis had set an Aug. 15 deadline 
for
lawmakers to take action on the rescue deal. If no bill is passed by then--as
seems likely--the utility has the right to walk away from negotiations.

??However, it became evident Thursday that the dueling measures making their
way through both houses lacked strong support.

??In the Assembly, the Hertzberg-Keeley bill, a modification of Davis' 
original
plan, was competing against a rival bill by Assemblyman Rod Wright (D-Los
Angeles), who had teamed with Republicans to push what he bluntly called a
"straight bailout" of Edison.

??In the Senate, Davis' original plan was amended by Sen. Byron Sher
(D-Stanford) and turned into a trimmed-down rescue plan that was opposed by
Edison.

??Sher's bill was voted down twice in policy committees Wednesday and 
Thursday,
but it was resuscitated both times, and is now on the Senate floor.

HEADLINE: Edison May Avert Bankruptcy Filing;
Energy: Thanks to a rate increase and natural gas price drop, the utility's
improved cash flow may cover its electricity costs.

BYLINE: JERRY HIRSCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER

BODY:

??For the first time in months, Southern California Edison is collecting more
money than it is spending on electricity, a shift that could enable the 
utility
to avoid bankruptcy without a state intervention as dramatic as the proposed $
2.8-billion purchase of the company's transmission lines.

??The turnabout has come during the last several weeks as natural gas 
prices--a
major component in the cost of electricity--have plummeted and as Edison has
collected more money from customers through a record increase in rates 
approved
by state regulators.

??The utility this month expects to collect more than it will spend on
electricity--the first time that has happened since the state's power crunch
started in May 2000. If the trend holds, Edison would be able to cover several
hundred million dollars in losses that piled up after Feb. 1 from its 
purchases
of electricity, said executives at the Rosemead-based company.

??Edison's relief comes against a backdrop in which the California power 
crisis
appears to be easing, as consumers conserve energy, new power plants come 
online
and wholesale prices moderate from the high levels of last winter.

??The executives said that barring an unusually severe heat wave, which would
prompt customers to crank up energy-guzzling air conditioners, or another 
spike
in natural gas prices, Edison by early next year also could make payments on a
proposed bond offering to pay down its $3.5 billion in debt from energy
purchases before Feb. 1.

??Creditors of the utility and consultants working with the governor's office
agree that such a scenario could mean that Edison would be able to stay out of
U.S. Bankruptcy Court without the state buying the company's transmission 
lines,
which is a key element in Gov. Gray Davis' now-stalled proposal to rescue the
utility.

??Jim Scilacci, the utility's chief financial officer, has hinted at improving
company finances during conference calls with creditors holding $931 million 
in
defaulted bonds and notes in recent weeks. Investors have responded 
positively,
boosting the company's depressed stock price about 45% in the last six weeks 
to
a Thursday close of $14.70 on the New York Stock Exchange.

??Although Edison's cash flow may be enough to cover its electricity costs, 
its
huge debts keep it far from solvency. Moreover, the company still faces two 
wild
cards in its fight to avoid bankruptcy: California's own claims on that cash 
and
the utility's uncertain prospects of gaining state approval to use the money 
to
repay its debts.

??The Department of Water Resources is buying electricity for 27 million
Californians served by Edison and the state's two other regulated utilities. 
The
agency could disclose as soon as today how big a slice it will take from
Edison's rate collections to repay a proposed $13.4-billion bond offering to
cover the state's purchases.

??The water agency began buying electricity from private generators in 
January,
after Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric Co., the Northern California utility,
became mired in debt. PG&E went on to file for bankruptcy protection in April.

??"What this means for Edison all depends on how much money it can keep," said
Paul Patterson, an analyst with investment bank ABN Amro in New York.

??The water department's requirements could eat up much of the margin that has
provided Edison with its small cushion this month. However, Joseph Fichera,
chief executive of Saber Partners, which is advising the governor, said the
latest numbers indicate that there is enough money in current rates to 
implement
the governor's plan to pay for the utility's debt as well as the state's 
current
and future power purchases.

??Even if the water department allocation still left room for Edison to pay 
off
its debts, such a course of action would require approval by the state
Legislature and the Public Utilities Commission. Although energy trends appear
to allow the utility to regain its financial footing, analysts cautioned that
the utility still could find itself in Bankruptcy Court if the state doesn't
provide a method for Edison to pay its debts.

??"While we might be able to cover our costs going forward, it is equally
important that we have a way to pay off that $3.5-billion debt," said Brian
Bennett, an Edison vice president. "But without knowing what [the water
department's] revenue needs are, we won't know what is left over in rates to
cover our costs."

??Bennett blamed the utility's so-called under-collection--debts that piled up
as frozen consumer rates could not cover soaring wholesale electricity 
costs--on
what he called "flawed regulatory policies."

??Based on recent energy prices, Bennett said, "We are just only beginning to
repay the under-collection."

??The recently enacted rate increases, which kicked in last month, have pushed
what Edison can charge customers for the electricity component of their bills
from about 7 cents a kilowatt-hour to 10.27 cents.

??At the same time, declining natural gas prices have sliced in half what the
utility must pay to a group of small and alternative-energy companies that
generate about 27% of its electricity needs. Edison, for example, paid this
group 18.6 cents a kilowatt-hour in February. That dropped to 13.6 cents by 
May
and now stands at about 7.5 cents. Each penny decline in the cost of 
electricity
from this group of generators represents more than $200 million in savings for
Edison on an annual basis.

??Bennett cautioned that if the water department requires additional funds or
if Edison's energy costs were to turn upward again, "then rates once again may
not be adequate to cover our generation costs. It is therefore imperative that
this uncertainty in the rate structure be cured now so we establish 
predictable,
stable rates for our customers."

??Three plans to aid Edison to varying degrees are working their way through
the Legislature, though late Thursday it appeared none would be approved 
before
lawmakers adjourn for a summer recess. Several legislators have said they are
content to let Edison join PG&E in bankruptcy.

??Any plan that would allow Edison to use a portion of the rates it is
collecting to pay off a bond offering would meet the objection of some 
consumer
groups, which label the concept a corporate bailout.

??"Just as the utilities gambled on deregulation and were winners at first,
Edison now has to be responsible for its losses," said Harvey Rosenfield,
president of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica. 
He
said Bankruptcy Court is the most appropriate place for Edison to resolve its
financial problems.

??Several creditors of the utility, however, said that as long as Edison can
tread water or even work down its debts, there is little incentive to put the
company into bankruptcy, which would only add another legal layer and more
expenses to an exceptionally complicated situation.

??Creditors could move against the company if they believed its finances were
declining and thus shrinking the amount of cash and assets that could be
distributed in a bankruptcy proceeding. They also could put Edison into
involuntary bankruptcy if some creditors exacted payment from the company 
ahead
of others that are owed money.

CONFLICT: Holdings called unethical

SOURCE: Chronicle Staff Writer

BYLINE: Mark Martin

DATELINE: Sacramento

BODY:
One consultant hired by the state to negotiate long-term electricity contracts
owned stock in a company that signed billion-dollar deals with California.

???Another fresh hire bought more than $10,000 in stock in Enron Corp. -- the
Houston power trader frequently vilified by Gov. Gray Davis and lawmakers -- 
as
he helped the state develop electricity buying strategy.

???A top Davis lawyer told the two consultants and seven others on Wednesday
morning to sell off stock in companies like Enron and Calpine Corp. within 
four
hours or lose their jobs.

???Having a financial interest in electric companies while working for the
state on power issues was not ethical, said Barry Goode, Davis' legal affairs
secretary, in a memo.

???All nine complied with the directive, said Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio
said, but controversy intensified yesterday over whether some of the state's
hired guns managing the energy crisis have conflicts of interest.

???The stock investments have come to light in the past week as 35 consultants
hired by the state to buy and schedule power and to negotiate energy contracts
have submitted documents detailing their personal finances.

???Most of the consultants who owned stock list their jobs as schedulers --
those who schedule electricity deliveries after power has been purchased.

???But others more directly involved with power trading also owned stock in
energy companies, documents show.

???Richard Ferreira earns $200 an hour to help negotiate and manage the 
state's
long-term contracts with power companies. He started his job Jan. 31.

???According to Ferreira's financial statement, he owned between $2,000 and $
10,000 worth of stock in Calpine Corp. -- the company based in San Jose that
announced on Feb. 28 it had signed two long-term contracts with the state 
worth
$8.3 billion.

???Ferreira could not be reached for comment, and spokesmen for the Department
of Water Resources, which hired the consultants, said he did not know if
Ferreira worked on the Calpine contracts.

???Another consultant, Richard Nichols, bought between $10,000 and $100,000
worth of stock in Enron in April -- more than three months after his company
signed on with the state to help "in the procurement of power supplies,"
according to his job description. The stock buy came at a time when the 
Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission was taking a hard line against wholesale
electricity price caps for California.

???Nichols' company, Navigant Consulting, Inc., could make as much as $800,000
for its work for the state this year. Nichols could not be reached for 
comment.

???Citing invoices from Controller Kathleen Connell's office, Secretary of
State Bill Jones, an announced GOP candidate for governor, argued that there 
are
at least seven other Navigant employees who are billing the state for work on
energy issues. None of them have disclosed their financial interests.

???Jones said he takes issue with the Davis administration's decisions on who
should file financial statements and who should be exempt.

???FINANCES NOT DISCLOSED

???Several consultants, including two Wall Street firms that made $275,000 a
month to negotiate the state's attempts to bail out troubled public utilities,
have not disclosed their finances because Davis officials have concluded they 
do
not fit the definition of a consultant.

???Jones has suggested that the state's long-term deals with several companies
to deliver electricity might be invalid if negotiators had a financial stake 
in
those companies.

???Maviglio said Davis officials were investigating whether there had been any
direct conflicts. The state attorney general's office and the state's Fair
Political Practices Commission also are reviewing Jones' allegations.

???Maviglio and a spokesman for the state's Department of Water and Power 
could
not say yesterday whether new employees were asked before they were hired
whether they had any financial stake in the energy market.

???STOCKS SOLD VOLUNTARILY

???But some consultants acknowledged a potential conflict and got rid of 
stocks
before this week. In his filing, Mark Skowdronski reports owning more than $
10,000 worth of Reliant Energy stocks when he began his job in March of
negotiating long-term contracts for the state. When he was given the task of
negotiating with Reliant, he said he sold his stock on March 20.

???Jones has stopped short of accusing anyone of criminal activity. And a
letter from Attorney General Bill Lockyer to Jones notes that the consultants
would have to own more than 3 percent of a company they dealt with to be
prosecuted criminally.

???Maviglio said the accusations come from a man who is launching his run for
Davis' job next year.

???"This is all politics," said Steve Maviglio, Davis' press secretary. "We're
following the law."

???He said that when the state was forced to enter the business of buying 
power
earlier this year, officials had to quickly hire people who knew the energy
business, including some who still had investments in power companies.

???"If you want a plumber, you hire a guy who has plumbing experience,"
Maviglio said.E-mail Mark Martin at markmartin@sfchronicle.com.

HEADLINE: Democrats defy Davis with bill on PUC;

Utilities panel would keep power over rates

SOURCE: Chronicle Sacramento Bureau

BYLINE: Lynda Gledhill

DATELINE: Sacramento

BODY:
Lawmakers moved with lightning speed yesterday to undo a plan that would force
California regulators to raise electricity rates whenever state power buyers
deem it necessary.

???A hastily introduced bill pits Democratic lawmakers against the
administration of Gov. Gray Davis, which is counting on the state Public
Utilities Commission to approve rate increases to pay for electricity without
questioning whether the state got a good price.

???Historically, utilities bought their electricity and asked the PUC to
approve rate hikes. The PUC decided whether the requests were justified.

???But with the utilities now deeply in debt and the state buying electricity,
the old system has broken down. This week, the PUC issued a draft agreement 
that
would guarantee the state would get as much money as it needs to pay for the
electricity it is buying.

???Consumer advocates said the proposed agreement would force the PUC to cede
its responsibility to protect customers from unreasonable rate increases.

???Senate leader John Burton, D-San Francisco, called the agreement
"overreaching" by the governor's Department of Water Resources, which is 
buying
the state's power.

???Under Burton's bill, consumers would still have to repay $13.4 billion in
bonds that the state plans to float to cover its purchases. But the bill would
allow the PUC to scrutinize the state's expenses beyond those covered by the
bond -- costs mounting to billions of dollars over the next 15 to 20 years.

???The bill passed out of two committees with bipartisan support yesterday and
now faces a vote by the full Senate. Both business and consumer groups 
expressed
their support for the measure.

???"This is better for ratepayers," said Lenny Goldberg of the Utility Reform
Network. "It makes the bond issue secure and gives a chance to look into all 
of
the contracts."

???PUC Commissioner Richard Bilas said some change is needed to restore
commission oversight.

???"The only check and balance on the Department of Water Resources as it is
would be the governor," Bilas said. "I think it takes a different branch of
government to do that oversight."

???But Bruce Van Dusen, a lawyer hired by the Department of Water Resources,
said Burton's bill could delay the bond sale and jeopardize the general fund.

???The concern is that while Burton's bill guarantees that the bond issue 
would
be repaid, it does not spell out how all the long-term electricity contracts
that the state has signed will be covered. The contracts stipulate that the
generators will be paid through electricity rates.Chronicle staff writer

HEADLINE: More energy fallout

BODY:
THEY SAY nothing is fair in love and war. It isn't. But nor is it fair when it
comes to energy.

???In Washington, Vice President Dick Cheney, champion of the drill-and-burn
industry, asks the Navy to foot the electric bills for his mansion.

???At the same time, the vice president refuses to disclose the costs incurred
by his energy task force or to reveal the hot shots from the oil and gas
industry who helped shape its final policies.

???Closer to home, California residents brace for the aftershocks of the 
energy
crisis. With the state now locked into secret, long-term and costly energy
contracts, it is the public -- not the energy suppliers who made out like
bandits -- who will be burdened by the billions spent purchasing electricity.

???At present, only 39 percent of those surveyed approve of the way Gov. Gray
Davis has handled this crisis. Approval may drop even lower when California 
residents absorb the astonishing news that we suddenly enjoy an energy surplus
and that our state is now selling it on a glutted market.

???Add to the disgruntled those folks who were already in the habit of 
shutting
off lights and lowering their thermostats. For them, the mail brought no 20
percent rebate on their electricity bill. It is the watt hogs, who never 
lowered
the air conditioner and left lights burning all over their homes, whose paltry
efforts netted them the governor's award.

???Give the governor credit for keeping the lights on in California. But his
less-than-bold decisions will result in serious political and economic
consequences. Soon, we will have to confront the grave reality that we have
mortgaged many of our dreams for expanded health care, improved education and
support for the mentally ill for a future burdened by crushing debt.

HEADLINE: PUC agrees to adjust electric rates if necessary

BYLINE: By KAREN GAUDETTE, Associated Press Writer

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

BODY:

??When the California Department of Water Resources asks the Public Utilities
Commission to raise electric rates, the PUC no longer will be able to refuse 
if
it feel those hikes are unjustified or are not in the public's best interest.

??So reads a proposal between the DWR and the state Public Utilities 
Commission
released earlier this week that could go into effect next month and has both 
PUC
members and public advocacy groups worried.

??"This gives an unelected unaccountable state agency ... the unilateral right
to order rate increases for the next 15 years," Harvey Rosenfield, President 
of
the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer rights said earlier this week. "Every
mistake they could possibly make will also be passed along to ratepayers."

??The numbers that will indicate whether the state will need to try out the
proposed process are scheduled to be released by the DWR on Friday. Loretta
Lynch, PUC president, and Oscar Hidalgo, a DWR spokesman, both said they 
believe
current electric rates cover the state's power buying costs for now.

??But the thought of a state agency potentially hitting residents and
businesses in the pocketbook without any oversight so troubles Sen. John 
Burton,
D-San Francisco, that he is pushing legislation that would retain the PUC's
authority to say no.

??Since January, the DWR has spent more than $8 billion buying electricity for
the customers of three financially ailing utilities. It will likely spend $43
billion to supply Californians with electricity over the next 20 years.

??The PUC raised rates twice already this year, money which the utilities pass
along to the DWR to help it pay its debts. But in order for the state to issue
some $13 billion in bonds later this summer, it must show Wall Street that it
has a solid stream of money rolling in that will cover its power-buying needs.
Ratepayers will pay off those bonds over 15 years, and state officials say a
solid revenue stream could help keep interest low.

??The PUC/DWR proposal gives the DWR - a state agency whose director is not
elected, critics point out - the ability to ask for rate increases that would
essentially be rubber-stamped by the PUC with a 30 to 90 day turnaround.

??"This authority to pass through costs without CPUC review would never be
permitted for costs incurred by a utility," Burton wrote.

??Burton's bill would set aside a certain amount of ratepayer revenue to go to
DWR, rather than steering the entire amount in its direction.

??Power buying expenses and administrative costs would be reviewed by the PUC
and the public to determine if it is appropriate to raise electric rates to 
fund
them.

??The bill would also retain the right of Californians to have someone other
than their local utility provide their electricity, a tenant of deregulation 
which the PUC has seemed likely to end.

??In May, the PUC issued a record rate increase that raises electric rates by
roughly 38 percent for residential ratepayers who use the most power, and by
varying amounts for farmers and businesses. That followed a roughly 10 percent
rate hike in January.

??The state has bought electricity for the customers of Pacific Gas and
Electric Co., Southern California Edison Co. and San Diego Gas and Electric 
Co.
since January, when the utilities warned the state that high power prices and
the inability to recoup their costs through frozen electric rates were driving
them into debt.

??PG&E filed for federal bankruptcy protection April 6. Edison and SDG&E both
have agreed to sell their transmission lines at above market value to the 
state
for to make up for their losses, though the Legislature has not decided 
whether
to approve the deals.

??The PUC will take comments on the agreement until Aug. 1.

HEADLINE: Power Struggle

ANCHORS: ALISON SMITH

BODY:

??ALISON SMITH: Oil. Gas. Alberta. Three words often said in the same breath.
But it's coal that supplies the province with most of its electricity. A
plentiful resource with enormous potential. Especially for export to the 
United
States. Canada's largest private power company TransAlta is planning a huge
expansion to one of its coal fired plants. But it's a plan that's meeting 
plenty
of resistance. Here's the CBC's Margo McDiarmid with the power struggle.

??TYKE DREVER: It used to be where the kids used to play in the sand and the
level of the lake was basically right here. At that point in time I could 
bring
my motor boat into here and actually winch it into the boathouse for the 
winter.
Now if we look in the distance behind me, you'll see how far out my motor boat
is now.

??MARGO MCDIARMID: Tyke Drever has seen his lake change a lot over the years.
The water is simply disappearing.

??DREVER: That used to all be lake bottom. That was all lake bottom. There was
water covering all that but not has turned into green grass.

??MCDIARMID: Drever's home is on Lake Wabamun, about 75 kilometers west of
Edmonton, one of the region's most popular recreation spots. It's also the 
site
of three coal fired power plants owned by TransAlta, two of them right on the
lake. The coal comes from the mine right across the bay. Drever and his
neighbours have an on-going battle with TransAlta, Canada's largest private
power company. They blame TransAlta for blocking streams that drain into the
lake, for sucking up water to make power.

??DREVER: I think it would be fair to say that probably the mining is the
starting point of the problems because nobody knows what in actual fact, what
the mining has done to the natural mother nature's inflow, influx of water 
into
the lake.

??MCDIARMID: And now there'll be an even larger power plant just down the 
road.
TransAlta wants to double the size of its Keephills plant, adding two new
generators like these. Alone they'd be enough to power a city the size of
Edmonton.

??LINDA DUNCAN (Wabamun Lake Resident): I'd rather have the lake back.

??UNIDENTIFIED MAN (1): I'd rather have the lake back too.

??MCDIARMID: Drever and other members of a local group don't like the thought
of an even bigger power plant nearby.

??DREVER: They will say that the Keephills plant is outside of the watershed
area of the Lake Wabamun. Question mark. We don't know that.

??BOB CALHOON (Wabamun Lake Resident): It scares me.

??MCDIARMID: Why is that?

??CALHOON: Because we've seen the damage that is done now with the plants we
have here now. What kind of damage is going to be done when they expand these
plants even greater than they are now?

??MCDIARMID: TransAlta hasn't built a new plant in years because of 
uncertainty
over deregulation. Now the rules are clear. Power is bought and sold by 
private
companies. With an energy shortage in Alberta, TransAlta is ready to expand.

??MIKE KELLY (TransAlta): We have such a shortage of electricity and demand is
so high that we thought we really had to move, to do something about that, to
fill the gap.

??MCDIARMID: TransAlta says most of its new power will stay in Alberta. Any
extra will be exported to B.C. and then possibly to California. But Americans
want more from any Alberta company willing to sell. With natural gas prices
going up, cheap Alberta coal power is a hot item.

??MURRAY SMITH: When the Americans come to visit you, they don't come for tea.
And they want things.

??MCDIARMID: Energy Minister Murray Smith says Alberta will help them out. At 
a
recent gathering of energy ministers, Smith pointed out the province is ready 
to
cash in on the export business.

??SMITH: I think that exports are actually, in the long run, a good thing for
Alberta. To be able to reach out with exports allows us to build the grids,
build the inner connects and then allows us to generate more power that will
give Albertans lower prices.

??MCDIARMID: And they're already lining up to buy Alberta's power. The 
National
Energy Board is now juggling seven applications for export licenses to bring
power from Alberta to the U.S. and more than half are from big American
companies. One of the largest is Morgan Stanley, an international investment
bank based in New York. Morgan Stanley wants a 20 year export license from the
National Energy Board. The plan? Buy up extra power in Alberta and sell it to
California.

??BRIAN STAZINSKI (Clean Air Coalition): I think they're profiteers. They're
coming in here and asking for about three percent of our supply to sell to the
United States and when we ask them where are you getting supplied from, they 
go,
hm, we don't know. We don't care. We're just going to get a piece of the 
action
and make some money on this. What's cost effective about continuing to 
generate
all kinds of emissions?

??MCDIARMID: Brian Stazinski is an environmentalist, named on of Time Magazine
six heroes of the planet for his work with conservation. But now he's taken on
new work. To stop Morgan Stanley's export application and others like it.
Because exports mean building more plants and burning more coal.

??STAZINSKI: It's just fast track approval all the way to the bank. And so
we're going to see a lot of developments if the Morgan Stanley's get their 
way.
I don't think the people of Alberta understand that.

??PAT SPILSTEAD (Wabamun Lake Resident): So many of these things are now
sensible.

??MCDIARMID: The residents of Wabamun Lake understand it. They just have to
look out the window. TransAlta is expanding one plant now. The power will 
mostly
stay in Alberta. But no one around this table thinks it will stop there.

??DREVER: At five or six applications a year, it's not unreasonable to assume
that there might be eight plants around the shore of this lake. I mean where
does it stop?

??DUNCAN: We're swamped and we keep saying who's there in the Government of
Alberta and the Government of Canada to represent the interests of the public 
of
Alberta?

??SPILSTEAD: Where do the economics become more important than the 
environment.
Now we're an isolated little problem, but maybe a perfect example of a great
intrusion on the Alberta environment.

??MCDIARMID: And critics say the environment will pay the price. Alberta coal
is considered cleaner because it has low amounts of chemicals that cause smog.
But burning it still creates a long list of toxins like particulants -- tiny
bits of dust that can lodge in the lungs. They're considered a toxic 
substance.
Coal power increases carbon dioxide linked to global warming. And then there's
mercury. It's linked to birth defects and nerve damage. New research by 
federal
committee on mercury shows that among the provinces, Alberta's coal plants
generate 41 percent of all the mercury in the country, the highest rate in
Canada. Environmentalists are pushing for a public debate on exporting power.

??STAZINSKI: They should have a say about whether or not we should be digging
up our farm land, burning the coal, getting all of the emissions so that the
Americans can get the benefits of the electricity. People of Alberta should 
have
an opportunity to say whether or not that's a good idea.

??UNIDENTIFIED MAN (2): Anything you didn't understand or anything you need to
clarify?

??MCDIARMID: Power companies are well aware the public is nervous.

??UNIDENTIFIED MAN (3): I was just wondering how much increase of mercury...

??MCDIARMID: TransAlta is hosting meetings to answer questions. It's promising
the Keephills plant will use state of the art technology to keep its pollution
to a minimum.

??KELLY: There are new standards that have been put in place by Alberta
environment and we're going to meet those standards and we're going to put on
some, some pretty solid technology actually to control our emissions.

??DREVER: Come on, Kilt

???Come on

???That a girl



??MCDIARMID: It will get busier in the Lake Wabamun area. TransAlta wants to
open its bigger plant in four years. The company says the Keephills plant and
the mine are too far away to affect the lake. In fact, it's now putting some 
of
the water back to raise the level. Tyke Drever would like to think that's 
true.

??DREVER: Wouldn't it be wonderful if in my lifetime I could see this water
lapping at those piers again, lapping at those railway ties again? And my 
kids'
kids playing in water at the edge here. Kiltie

???Come on Kilt



??MCDIARMID: Drever is also realistic. He knows there's a big thirst for
electricity. It's very political. New projects will be hard to stop. And he
wonders what price in the end Alberta will have to pay for its power.

??DREVER: It's raining. It's raining a little bit.

??MCDIARMID: For The National, I'm Margo McDiarmid in Wabamun Lake, Alberta.

??SMITH: We'll be back in a moment with a program note.

KR-ACC-NO: LD-CHEAPER-POWER

LENGTH: 809 words

HEADLINE: Cheaper Energy Undercuts California's Long-Term Power Contracts

BYLINE: By Dana Bartholomew

BODY:


??California suddenly faces an energy surplus, forcing the state to sell power
it bought for an average of $ 138 per megawatt for as little as a dollar,
electricity traders say.

??In fact, the state has sold its unused power so cheaply that the Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power -- which has made tens of millions selling power
to the state during the crisis -- has become an occasional buyer of power from
the state at rates below its normal costs.

??State officials acknowledged that cool temperatures and the surprising
success of conservation efforts have glutted the energy market in the past 
week
but they dismissed the surplus as a "blip."

??They said they are getting $ 15 to $ 30 per megawatt for up to 6,000
megawatts a day during the early-morning hours -- losing millions of dollars 
on
power purchased in recent months under long-term contracts.

??"Both $ 1 and $ 5 have occurred," said Gary Ackerman, executive director of
the Western Power Trading Forum, which represents many generators and 
utilities
that sell millions in power to the state each day.

??"It gives Californians a great glimpse of what happens when the state moves
into private industry. They (legislators) do the right thing politically, and 
it
backfires economically," he said.

??Critics say the state, in an effort to capture runaway wholesale energy 
costs
this spring, locked in power at too high a price. Ultimately, ratepayers of 
such
private utilities as Southern California Edison, will be forced to pick up the
tab.

??"We think it's an outrage," said Kris Vosburgh of the Howard Jarvis 
Taxpayers
Association. "The governor went willingly into these agreements and tried to
prevent the public and the press from seeing them (and) didn't ask for public 
or
expert participation.

??"Now it's the ratepayers that are paying for his mistake."

??The state, assisted by former Los Angeles DWP General Manager David Freeman,
has negotiated more than $ 42 billion in such contracts that stretch as far as
2021.

??State officials disputed the rock-bottom rates quoted by forum traders.

??"I'm looking at the average price, and (it) far exceeds a dollar," said 
Oscar
Hidalgo, spokesman for the state Department of Water Resources, which now 
spends
$ 30 million a day on power, down from $ 65 million in May.

??"This is an overall blip on our picture here."

??Gov. Gray Davis defended the state's purchases, saying through spokesman
Steve Maviglio that they had stabilized the market.

??"Like we said all along, we're doing everything within our power to control
the situation and stabilize things," he told The New York Times. "But the
weather is not within our control. When the utilities were in this business,
they ran into this situation routinely."

??While the state once spent most of its money for energy on the volatile spot
market, it currently buys 95 percent of its power under long-term contracts.

??Unlike natural gas, electrical energy can't be stored and must be passed on.
When usage fails to meet expected demand, during a cooler summer for example,
suppliers are forced to accept whatever price they can get for the surplus --
sometimes at a loss.

??Some of that loss, Hidalgo said, was to pay back power loans from the 
federal
Bonneville Power Authority in Washington state.

??While the state admitted shedding up to 20 percent of its power since July
11, Ackerman said that up to 6,000 megawatts a night of surplus power was
previously "laid off."

??Selling surplus power is common to any utility -- or acting utility -- in 
the
energy business. California Energy Markets, a trade weekly, said the state 
sold
such power July 12 at $ 25 a megawatt.

??Critics have called the state contracts with 42 energy generators turkeys 
for
locking in power purchases at $ 138 per megawatt hour, or $ 70 long-term.

??"The state was in a terrible bargaining position at the time (it wrote the
contracts)," said Pasadena Councilman Sid Tyler, chairman of the Deregulation 
Committee for the Pasadena Water and Power Department.

??"There's nothing quite as bad as having to buy high and sell low -- we all
know the consequences of that, long-term."

??Assemblyman Keith Richman, R-Granada Hills, has written an alternative bill
to rescue Southern California Edison that he said has a provision to scrap the
state's energy contracts.

??Richman, who had sued the state to release details of the contracts, said an
estimate from the state Controller's Office pegs them closer to $ 50 billion.

??"I am very concerned we have entered into these long-term contracts that 
will
not only cause an excess of power, but will cost the ratepayers for years to
come and be a burden on the back of Californians."

SECTION: COMMENTARY

LENGTH: 687 words

HEADLINE: Six months later, utility debts are still toughest nut to crack

SOURCE: Scripps-McClatchy Western Service

BYLINE: DAN WALTERS

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif.

BODY:

??When Gov. Gray Davis and other state politicians finally became engaged in
the energy crisis last January - a half-year late - the state's major
investor-owned utilities had already amassed more than $13 billion in debt 
from
runaway power costs and were out of credit.

??Davis and the Legislature launched a massive state power purchase program, a
speed-up of new power plants, conservation subsidies and other actions, not 
all
of which have successful. But everyone involved knew that the utilities' 
debts,
which had driven them to the brink of bankruptcy, would be the most complex 
and
politically difficult aspect of the crisis.

??Six months later, that's still true.

??An administration team negotiated for weeks with Pacific Gas and Electric 
and
Southern California Edison on schemes to retire their debts and bring them 
back
to a creditworthy status. The talks with PG&E went nowhere and three months 
ago,
the huge San Francisco-based utility filed for bankruptcy. Davis, clearly
concerned that Edison would follow, hammered out a deal with the smaller 
utility
within hours.

??It was, by any standard, a sweet deal for Edison and its parent company,
Edison International, too sweet for just about everyone in the Legislature, 
and
immediately efforts began to change it.

??Edison lobbyists worked the Legislature and the utility cranked up a massive
advertising and public relations campaign, to no apparent avail. And Davis,
oddly, pulled back from the fray. The governor concentrated on another aspect 
of
the crisis with greater political sex appeal: demanding that generators, many 
of
whom are PG&E and Edison creditors, be forced to repay many billions of 
dollars
because, as he put it, they had gouged the state. Ultimately, Davis' campaign
failed, although his strident advocacy did, apparently, arrest his decline in
public opinion polls. Meanwhile, the Edison deal languished. With the
Legislature now poised to leave Sacramento on a month-long summer recess and a
self-imposed deadline for enacting the Edison plan approaching, the Capitol is
newly aflutter with efforts.

??"Complex" doesn't even begin to describe the situation. There are at least
three alternative plans kicking around, none of which can be passed as 
written.
Davis may be willing to accept almost anything that would save him from the
embarrassment of another utility bankruptcy on his watch, but currently backs 
a
scheme ginned up by Assembly Democratic leaders. Edison, however, has split 
with
Davis and now favors an alternative offered by Republicans and some moderate
Democrats - one that consumer advocates denounced as a corporate bailout.
Meanwhile, liberal senators are pushing another version that Edison likes even
less, but its critics among consumer activists like more.

??With both lawmakers and outside interest groups so widely scattered over
what, if anything, should be done to rescue Edison, a consensus developed late
Thursday to keep the vehicles alive with preliminary floor votes, but continue
private negotiations through the month-long vacation recess.

??The many-sided stalemate stems from both the rivals plans' provisions -
farmers, for example, fear environmentalists' gaining authority through the
state over Edison-owned watershed in the Sierra - and the convoluted dynamics 
of
the Capitol.

??Legislative leadership is very weak in the era of term limits, especially in
the Assembly, and lawmakers are leery about voting for any complex utility
measure, particularly one that might raise rates. Some call it "1890 disease"
for the number of the 1996 deregulation bill that backfired so badly.

??Then, too, some liberals and consumer activists appear to want all of the
measures to fail, forcing Edison into bankruptcy court. Then, they believe, 
the
newly created but still inactive state power authority could step in, using 
its
$5 billion in untapped bonding authority, and pick up assets of the utilities 
on
the cheap, thus creating a massive state utility system.

??Wheels within wheels, and none of them meshing.

Calif Lawmakers Seen Adjourning Without Deal For Edison
By Jason Leopold

Dow Jones Energy Service

OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The California Legislature is unlikely to pass a 
bill to rescue insolvent utility Southern California Edison before an Aug. 15 
deadline, key lawmakers said Monday.
The state Assembly is expected to adjourn for a monthlong break later Monday 
after it votes on the state's $101 billion budget, which has been fought over 
in both houses for more than a month. The Senate approved the budget early 
Saturday morning 
Once the budget is approved, Assembly members plan to leave for summer 
recess, according to Assembly Speaker Pro Tem Fred Keeley's office, and some 
said they won't return until Aug. 20. 
"I'm fairly sure nothing, other than behind-the-scenes talks will take place 
until after the break," said Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, chairman of the 
Senate committee investigating price gouging by generators. 
Jamie Fisfis, spokesman for the Assembly Republican Minority Caucus, said GOP 
members are leaving for trips and have no intention of returning before Aug. 
20. 
Failure to approve a rescue by Aug. 15 would put the Edison International 
(EIX) utility in a difficult spot. Southern California Edison, in default on 
debt obligations and power bills, is banking on a political solution and has 
said its creditors could drag it into bankruptcy if lawmakers don't pass a 
relief measure by the deadline. 
Gov. Gray Davis, who is also counting on a political solution, may call a 
special session to force action on a rescue plan if lawmakers don't pass 
something before recessing. 
"The governor said he will not hesitate to call a special session if he needs 
to," spokesman Steve Maviglio said. Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, 
D-San Francisco, has disputed the governor's authority to do so. 
Brian Bennett, Edison International's vice president of external affairs, 
remained optimistic that a rescue agreement can be worked out before Aug. 15. 
"There's a group of naysayers out there saying this is not going to get 
done," Bennett said. "The Senate is on the record saying a legislative 
solution is better than bankruptcy. And for the millionth time, this company 
has no intention of filing for bankruptcy." 
Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys, and Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, who 
sponsored legislation to rescue Southern California Edison but failed to gain 
the support of a majority of the Assembly, are expected to hold work sessions 
this week to put together a comprehensive piece of legislation that can gain 
the support of the Senate, Gov. Gray Davis and the utility. 
It's unclear who will participate in the work group or whether lawmakers can 
hammer out legislation and pass it before the Aug. 15 deadline set in a 
memorandum of understanding Southern California Edison Ed signed with the 
state in April. 
The MOU calls for the state to buy the utility's transmission lines for $2.76 
billion and enable it to issue debt backed by ratepayers to recoup $3.5 
billion in unrecovered wholesale power costs. 
Each house of the state Legislature is working on its own plan, neither of 
which would implement the MOU in full. 
The Senate bill, which narrowly passed that body Friday, would allow Southern 
California Edison to recover $2.5 billion of its power costs by issuing bonds 
and give the state a five-year option on the utility's transmission lines. 
Edison executives have already said the bill doesn't provide the company with 
sufficient funds to become creditworthy.

California; Metro Desk
Sanctions Against Enron Urged Electricity: A state Senate panel probing 
suspected price gouging says the Houston generator refuses to disclose 
documents.
CARL INGRAM
TIMES STAFF WRITER

07/22/2001
Los Angeles Times
Home Edition

SACRAMENTO -- A Senate committee investigating suspected price gouging in the 
California electricity market recommended Saturday that a Texas generator be 
found in contempt and fined for refusing to disclose top-secret business 
records. 
The special committee recommended the actions against Enron Corp. of Houston, 
a major wholesaler of electricity. Swift ratification by the full Senate is 
expected.
The committee, investigating whether generators have manipulated prices to 
drive up profits during the state's energy crisis, urged that Enron be fined 
an initial $1,000 and that the cumulative sum be doubled for each day the 
company continues to defy the panel. 
In its controversial probe, the committee has found eight power sellers in 
contempt for failure to produce subpoenaed documents about their production 
and pricing practices. Recently, six of the companies have sought to have the 
contempt citations cleared by agreeing to hand over the records. 
But Enron and Reliant Energy have refused. Last week, the committee voted a 
second time to hold Reliant in contempt, but has so far suggested fines only 
against Enron. 
If Enron obeys the demand to turn over its trade secrets and other 
confidential information before the full Senate acts, the contempt action 
will be stopped, lawmakers said. 
"We have no hope they will comply," said Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana), 
committee chairman. 
Senate President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco) said upper chamber 
approval of the committee's recommendations would occur quickly, but called 
the progressively severe fines "pocket change" for Enron. 
"Ken Lay spends more than that on his Rolex watches," Burton said of Enron 
Chairman Kenneth Lay. 
An Enron official, Karen Denne, said the committee's recommendations took the 
company by surprise. She said Enron had been working in "good faith" with the 
committee to provide the information, but now was being exclusively targeted 
for punishment. 
"No one else has been singled out by the committee. Why is Enron being 
singled out?" she said. 
Denne said Enron in the last week had agreed to provide all its California 
transaction documents for last year. "That's far more than anyone else has 
turned over," she said. 
She conceded that the records did not detail out-of-state transactions, which 
the committee also had subpoenaed. 
Enron has refused to let the committee inspect its records, contending that 
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is the only regulatory entity that 
can legally investigate and control the wholesale electricity market in 
California. 
Enron and other generators also argued that their most closely guarded trade 
secrets would be put at risk of exposure to competitors if they were given to 
the committee, even under confidentiality agreements proposed by the panel. 
Though it is rarely used, the Senate last exercised its contempt power in 
1929 during a price-fixing investigation of the cement industry. Several 
executives were found in contempt for refusing to answer questions and were 
ordered to jail. 
The state Supreme Court, however, voided the contempt citations on grounds 
that the Senate's demands for information were too vague. 
Dunn said the committee considered recommending other punishments, including 
the jailing of top Enron executives and forbidding the firm from doing 
business in California as long as it was in contempt. 
He said the committee, which adopted the report on a unanimous bipartisan 
vote, agreed that payment of fines, known as "coercive penalties," was the 
best choice. 
The Senate ordered the investigation last winter as Gov. Gray Davis declared 
the state to be in an "energy emergency" and a series of rolling blackouts 
was imposed statewide. 
At the time, wholesale generators, most located out of state, were charging 
what some called "rip-off" prices. Davis has asked the federal government to 
order generators to refund almost $9 billion in alleged overcharges, but 
indications are that only about $1 billion may be paid. 
The committee was charged with examining the wholesale market and making 
recommendations for legislation if abuses were found. 
The committee subpoenaed Enron and seven other generators in April, insisting 
that they turn over millions of records relating to bidding strategies, 
prices, energy availability and documents dealing with possible antitrust 
issues, including out-of-state transactions. 
All the companies initially defied the subpoenas. But under the threat of 
contempt, most recently have said they will provide the information under 
confidentiality agreements. 
Enron and Reliant of Houston held out. Enron filed 20 objections to the 
subpoenas and argued that the committee's investigation was out of bounds. 
Reliant has sued the committee in Sacramento Superior Court to stop the 
investigation, charging that the panel violated the company's rights to due 
process and refused to hear its objections to the subpoena.

NEWS
THE ENERGY CRUNCH / Power firms' financial records destroyed, state is told
Robert Salladay
Chronicle Sacramento Bureau

07/22/2001
The San Francisco Chronicle
FINAL
A.9
(Copyright 2001)

A state Senate committee is investigating why Morgan Stanley, a financial 
adviser to several power generators, destroyed documents that could show a 
well-planned effort to gouge California consumers. 
After several weeks of asking for the documents, and getting a positive 
response from Morgan Stanley, the Senate committee was told last week that 
the documents were destroyed as a matter of routine "years ago."
"I got a call Wednesday from a Washington, D.C., counsel for Morgan Stanley, 
who said, 'I regret to inform you the documents have been destroyed,' " Sen. 
Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana (Orange County), chairman of the Senate investigating 
committee, said yesterday. 
The revelation came as the Senate moved against another company under 
scrutiny by Dunn's committee -- Enron Corp., the world's largest energy 
trader. The Senate was meeting yesterday to vote on the 2001-02 state budget 
but approved another step in contempt proceedings against Houston's Enron for 
its refusal to hand over documents to committee investigators. 
The central question is whether power companies colluded to raise prices by 
purposely withholding electricity. At one point this year, the price of power 
was the highest in state history -- more than $5,000 per megawatt -- as 
supplies sank to unusually low levels. 
The Senate inquiry into Morgan Stanley involves activity years before the 
energy crisis. Investigators suspect that power companies and their financial 
advisers knew well before the crisis began that prices could be raised. Any 
records confirming that suspicion would be evidence of extraordinary market 
power. 
At the time deregulation was being implemented during the late 1990s, nearly 
everyone involved was talking about how competition would push down the price 
of electricity. At the same time, however, power companies like North 
Carolina's Duke Energy Corp. were paying inflated prices to purchase power 
plants in California. 
After deregulation, the power companies paid nearly $2 billion total for 
aging plants worth an estimated $1.1 billion. 
"Electricity prices were stable and there was an oversupply (of energy) at 
the time, and these were the oldest units they were buying," Dunn said. "Why 
would they pay two or three times for these plants?" 
Dunn requested that Morgan Stanley (now called Morgan Stanley Dean Witter) 
provide all the supporting documentation regarding the purchase of the 
plants. He said he received commitments from company attorneys that no 
documents had been destroyed. 
A representative with Morgan Stanley declined to comment yesterday. But a 
Morgan Stanley attorney told the Orange County Register, which reported the 
story yesterday, that the company did not destroy any documents after the 
first May 16 request from Dunn's committee. 
"At the end of the project, they decided what they were going to keep and 
what they weren't going to keep, and those decisions were made years before 
the energy crisis and years before this committee existed," attorney Paul 
Patono told the Register. 
Dunn noted it is not illegal to raise prices or exert "market power," as long 
as the energy companies don't collude. But the issue is important to federal 
regulators, who could impose price controls on energy if they believe the 
system is not truly competitive. 
Only a few power firms have refused to hand over documents that the Senate 
committee has requested. Last week, Dunn's committee voted to move forward 
with contempt fines against Enron and Reliant Energy. They also authorized 
the committee to depose executives from the companies. 
Dunn also has recommended fines that would start at $1,000 on the first day 
and double each subsequent day. A $1,000 fine imposed on a Monday would rise 
to $16,000 by Friday, then double to $32,000 on Saturday. A week of delay 
would cost Enron $127,000. 
Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco, and the Rules 
Committee he controls have the option to raise the fines even higher. They 
plan to take up the matter this week. 
"They can afford it," Burton said yesterday about the proposed fines against 
Enron. "That's like pocket change. Ken Lay (chairman of Enron) spends more 
than that on his Rolex watches." 
Enron representatives could not be reached for comment. Their attorneys have 
previously told Senate investigators that they want a confidentiality 
agreement to protect their bidding practices from being made public.

Senate committee told Morgan Stanley destroyed power records

Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

SACRAMENTO (AP) - A state Senate committee wants to know why Morgan Stanley, 
a multibillion dollar financial firm and adviser to several power generators, 
destroyed documents that potentially could show efforts to gouge California 
consumers. 
The company recently also has come under the scrutiny of an Oregon lawmaker 
who is concerned the company's purchase of the rights to move power between 
California and Oregon could result in artificially high prices.
For several weeks, Morgan Stanley had told the committee it would provide the 
documents, but said last week they had been destroyed as a matter of routine 
"years ago," said Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, the committee's chairman. 
Members of the committee are trying to determine whether power companies 
worked together to raise prices by purposefully holding back electricity to 
drive up demand. 
Morgan Stanley's involvement would have been several years ago, when it 
advised out-of-state energy companies to buy California power plants up for 
sale. 
A Morgan Stanley attorney told the Orange County Register that the company 
did not destroy any documents after Dunn's committee requested the documents 
May 16. 
"At the end of the project, they decided what they were going to keep and 
what they weren't going to keep, and those decisions were made years before 
the energy crisis and years before the committee existed," said Paul Patono, 
a company attorney. 
Dunn noted it is not illegal to raise prices as long as a company doesn't 
collude to force prices upward. 
Private utilities became able to sell their plants as part of the 1996 plan 
to deregulate the electricity market. Although the plants were expected to 
sell below their book value, they instead sold for up to three times that 
price, although the state then had an oversupply of electricity and old 
plants. 
While the public was told deregulation would lead to lower electricity 
prices, energy officials and experts testifying before the committee have 
said it's unlikely investors would buy aging power plants if they believed 
that to be true. 
Dunn is curious if there was any kind of plan or advertising that said the 
plants, if bought a certain way, would give of the buyers market power in the 
wholesale electricity market. 
The committee is still moving forward with contempt proceedings against 
Houston-based power marketers Enron Corp. and Reliant Energy for refusing to 
hand over documents to committee investigators. 
New York-based Morgan Stanley, now Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co., got into 
the energy trading in 1984 and now is one of the top 20 U.S. power marketers. 
The company also has come under the scope of Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore. 
Morgan Stanley bought the rights to transmit just under a third of the power 
flowing between California and Oregon from the Bonneville Power 
Administration through February 2002. 
DeFazio has written a letter to the BPA, asking that the agency make sure the 
Northwest keeps its "reliable, affordable" energy source. 
"The ability of a financial services company, which has no obligation to 
serve electricity consumers, to lock up all available capacity for a year 
raises serious concerns," DeFazio wrote. 
A company spokeswoman said Morgan Stanley acquired the transmission capacity 
from BPA to meet its power delivery obligations in the Northwest, and had no 
intention of manipulating the market.

USA: UPDATE 1-Calif. govt panel wants Reliant cited for contempt.

07/18/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

SACRAMENTO, Calif., July 18 (Reuters) - A California legislative panel voted 
on Wednesday to ask the state Senate to cite Reliant Energy Inc. for contempt 
for failing to comply with a subpoena seeking confidential documents. 
The Senate Select Committee to Investigate Market Manipulation voted 6-0 to 
move against Houston-based Reliant, which joins fellow Texas energy giant 
Enron Corp. in facing what could be the first contempt citations imposed by 
California's state senate since 1929.
State Sen. Joe Dunn, the Democratic chair of the panel investigating charges 
of market manipulation and price gouging in California's energy crisis, would 
now begin preparing a full report on Reliant's noncompliance for the full 
Senate. 
The committee's report on Enron could be ready for submission to the full 
Senate Thursday, he said, adding that continued efforts to negotiate an 
agreement had proved fruitless. 
"We have been discussing this with them virtually every single day, and they 
are not in compliance yet," Dunn told Reuters. "Twenty-four hours ago I was 
cautiously optimistic about them, I am now back to pessimistic." 
According to state law, California's senators must use the reports to decide 
whether to slap sanctions on the two companies. They also have the option of 
fining or imprisoning company senior officers. 
Enron, for its part, has filed a lawsuit in Sacramento Superior Court 
challenging the investigative committee's authority to subpoena company 
documents. 
Senate aides said Reliant could follow the lead of another energy company, 
Atlanta-based Mirant Corp. , which has avoided the contempt threat by 
cooperating with legislators' demands to sign confidentiality agreements, 
open a document depository close to Sacramento, and begin placing documents 
there relating to the company's recent business in California. 
The vote against Reliant came despite the company's offer of some 10,000 
documents in an effort to satisfy some of the compliance requirements. 
Larry Drivon, special counsel with the select committee, said Reliant's offer 
represented far fewer documents than some other generators have produced, and 
that "virtually none" of the Reliant documents offered addressed the main 
points of concern as cited in the legislative subpoena. 
"What we've gotten this time is both insignificant and largely irrelevant," 
Drivon said. 
The committee also voted on Wednesday to suspend for 30 days proceedings 
against number of other energy firms, including Duke Energy Corp. , Dynegy 
Inc. , Williams Cos. Inc. , AES Corp. and NRG Energy Inc. , pending a review 
of their compliance efforts to date. 
Enron has argued the committee has no legal jurisdiction over wholesale 
electricity prices, which are regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Committee (FERC), and that the committee's proceedings violate the company's 
legal rights. 
State officials have accused the energy companies of overcharging California 
power agencies and utilities some $8.9 billion for wholesale electricity over 
the past 14 months, which saw power prices in the state soar tenfold. 
Independent energy merchants have blamed the price spike on the state's 
poorly designed electricity deregulation law and a failure to build enough 
power plants to meet the growing needs of its 34 million residents and its 
industries.

Calif Senator: Enron Contempt Charge Seen Dropped Tue

07/16/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- A California Senate committee is likely to drop a 
contempt charge against Enron Corp. (ENE) Tuesday because the company is 
close to agreeing to provide information for an investigation into wholesale 
electricity prices, Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, said late Monday. 
"There has been a dramatic change, and I am optimistic that by noon (Tuesday) 
there will be a resolution with Enron," said Dunn, who chairs the Senate 
Select Committee to Investigate Market Manipulation.
The committee voted last week to forward a contempt charge to the full Senate 
because Enron refused to provide certain financial documents and sign the 
committee's version of a confidentiality agreement. If the full Senate voted 
to hold Enron in contempt, it could issue punishments including hefty fines 
and incarceration of executives. - - 17/07/01 00-46G 

The committee also voted last week to drop its contempt charge at any time 
before a full Senate vote if Enron agreed to meet the committee's requests. 
"Enron has chosen to intimate to us that they will comply with our demands. 
They have asked us for the ability to preserve certain objections. There's a 
possibility we may be sued by other market participants, and if so, Enron 
wants to preserve its opportunities to pursue objections at that time," Dunn 
said. 
Enron filed a lawsuit last week to stop the committee's subpoena of financial 
records, and a company attorney said during hearings that Enron was likely to 
contest the contempt charge as well. 
In talks Monday, however, Enron mentioned the possibility of dropping the 
lawsuit, Dunn said, which is not a requirement to the committee's dropping 
the contempt charge. 
No-one at Enron could be reached immediately for comment. 
The documents sought by the price manipulation committee include information 
on bidding and pricing behavior in the state's electricity markets. The 
committee originally was poised to cite seven other electricity generators 
for contempt, but all eventually agreed to provide the requested information.

SACRAMENTO A Senate committee probing California's troubled energy market 
urged the full Senate to declare Enron Corp. in contempt for shunning a 
legislative subpoena, a move that could put the defiant power company's top 
executives at risk of arrest as early as next week. 
Shortly before the bipartisan vote, the Texas-based energy merchant sued the 
committee in a Sacramento Superior Court four blocks from the Capitol, 
contending lawmakers' demands for documents exceeded their jurisdiction, 
jeopardized confidential business information and trampled the company's 
rights.
The panel -- the Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation of the 
Wholesale Energy Market -- voted 6-0 in favor of the contempt finding. The 
decision means a report will be offered to the Senate, which has final 
authority to approve it. That decision could be made by early next week, 
although it could be postponed or withdrawn if the company cooperates, said 
Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana. 
If upheld, the Senate then will have broad authority to impose sanctions, 
including daily fines until the documents are produced or even arrests of 
company executives, said Clark Kelso, a law professor at the University of 
the Pacific's McGeorge Law School. A simple majority vote in the 40-member 
Senate is required. 
Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne disputed the authority of the Senate to order 
arrests. "Our key executives do not even live in the state of California. The 
first issue here is jurisdiction. They (California senators) don't have 
jurisdiction outside the state." 
The full Senate is likely to endorse the contempt finding. There is 
bipartisan sentiment for it, and lawmakers often unite when legislative 
authority is challenged. 
In one major case, a company official was held in contempt and briefly jailed 
until he agreed to cooperate with the Legislature during a investigation of a 
concrete company in 1929. 
"What they do in these circumstances can include sending the sergeant at arms 
out to arrest responsible officials and bring them back before the committee. 
Arrest, contingency fines -- they have a wide range of options," said Kelso, 
a legal trouble-shooter for the Davis administration. 
Matthew G. Jacobs, an attorney, former federal prosecutor and a legal 
consultant to the Legislature, agreed. 
"The government code says the Senate can take whatever action they deem 
appropriate," Jacobs said. The Senate could even refer the contempt finding 
to a local prosecutor, who could file misdemeanor criminal charges. 
Denne said the committee's investigation, and its contempt vote, was an 
attempt to "find a political scapegoat."

CALIFORNIA POWER CRISIS
Senate panel, energy firm fighting tough

SACRAMENTO -- A Senate panel moved a step toward holding Enron, an energy 
trading firm, in contempt for refusing to turn over documents senators hope 
can shed light on the state's soaring energy prices. 
Enron fired back by filing a lawsuit yesterday asserting that only the 
federal government has the authority to investigate the power market.
The panel, which had previously reached agreements with all the other major 
generators and marketing companies in California, voted 6- 0 to prepare a 
contempt recommendation for the Senate to consider next week. 
The Senate, which last issued a contempt citation in 1929, must approve any 
contempt recommendation. It then has wide-ranging powers to impose fines or 
jail time. 
The chairman of the Senate committee, state Sen. Joe Dunn, D- Laguna Nigel, 
said that if Enron agrees to turn over documents to the committee soon, then 
he will recommend that contempt proceedings be dropped. 
The Senate Select Committee to Investigate Market Manipulation also decided 
yesterday to drop contempt proceedings against Mirant, an Atlanta-based 
marketing company, because it had agreed to turn over documents. 
The dispute also touched on broader issues. 
Enron, the politically connected Houston-based marketing company, has been 
pushing electricity deregulation throughout the world. Company chairman 
Kenneth Lay is a friend and campaign contributor to President Bush. 
Last month the firm helped sponsor a congressional fund-raiser featuring the 
president, where contributors in tuxedos and gowns dined and drank around a 
giant gold "W" that reached to the rafters at the Washington Convention 
Center ballroom. 
Enron has also helped shape Bush's energy plan. It is one of several major 
donors accused of meeting secretly with Vice President Dick Cheney to draft 
the plan. 
Several senators on the panel disputed Enron's claim that only federal 
regulators, and not the state government, could investigate the electricity 
market. 
Further, they blasted the company for saying that California could not have 
access to documents stored outside the state at the firm's Houston 
headquarters. 
State Sen. Steve Peace, D-El Cajon, said the company was so defiant that it 
looked suspicious. 
"Your client doth protest too much," he said to Enron's attorney, Michael 
Kirby. "One can only wonder: What do you have to hide?" 
But Kirby said the company merely wanted to protect confidential information 
and get answers to its objections. That, he said, is why it filed a lawsuit 
contesting the committee's power to seek documents that Enron claimed would 
reveal trade secrets. 
Peace, however, took issue with the lawsuit, calling it a dramatic escalation 
in the dispute over an energy crisis that has cost the state billions. 
"You just declared war on this state's political system," he said.

Enron files suit over subpoena / Provider challenges move for documents

FINAL
A.15
(Copyright 2001)

In another escalation in the war between California and out-of- state energy 
providers, Enron Corp. filed a lawsuit yesterday challenging the 
Legislature's authority to subpoena company documents. 
The suit came as a Senate panel investigating market manipulation voted 6 to 
0 to move forward with a contempt motion against Enron. A report will be 
forwarded to the full Senate early next week if the marketer continues to 
refuse to comply with the subpoena.
"You just went to war with the state of California," Sen. Steve Peace, D-El 
Cajon, told the lawyer representing Enron. ". . . You already initiated a war 
economically; now you're in a political war." 
The Senate committee investigating price manipulation found Enron and Mirant 
Corp. in contempt last month for not turning over subpoenaed documents. The 
finding against Mirant was vacated yesterday because it agreed to turn over 
documents. 
The committee, chaired by Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, requested documents 
from power providers in early April. When the requests were ignored, the 
committee issued subpoenas asking generators for documents covering business 
plans, operations, risk management and investment strategies. 
Peace argued that forcing a judge to decide the scope of the Legislature's 
authority could provoke a constitutional crisis. 
"You are treading into the territory of asking the court to make judgment on 
the rules and the law governing the rights of the Legislature," Peace said. 
"It is a separation of powers issue of the highest order." 
But Michael Kirby, a lawyer hired by Enron, said the Houston company was 
simply looking for due process. 
"A subpoena is a subpoena and once you go that route you must comply with the 
law," he told the committee. "We are entitled to some kind of hearing with a 
neutral arbitrator. It was not our preference to file a lawsuit." 
Kirby and the lawsuit cite several objections to the Senate's subpoena. These 
include the confidentiality of the documents and whether a California body 
can require documents from outside the state. Enron also says that only 
federal regulators have the power to subpoena their records. 
Kirby and members of the committee disagreed over the scope of what a 
legislative subpoena covers versus one used in a criminal matter. 
"I think there is a fundamental misunderstanding about our legislative 
inquiry," Dunn said. "We are not drawing conclusions about guilt or 
innocence. We want to see what fixes must be made in the law." 
Kirby did say Enron has set up a depository in Sacramento and has 30,000 
documents ready to be deposited, pending an agreement can be reached on 
confidentiality issues. 
But that is not good enough for committee members, who believe that Enron has 
continue to evade the committee. 
"We have no indication that Enron ever intends to comply with the subpoena," 
said Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Marina del Ray.

California Officials Press Contempt Findings against Houston-Based Power Firm

Reporter (TM)

State legislators pressed forward with contempt findings against Enron Corp. 
on Wednesday after the company failed to produce subpoenaed documents and 
filed a lawsuit asking the court to intervene on its behalf. 
Lawmakers on a special Senate committee investigating electricity price 
manipulation warned that the voluminous lawsuit, filed in Sacramento Superior 
Court, could have far-reaching implications for the Legislature's ability to 
conduct investigations and make findings. A few even suggested the legal 
action could trigger "a constitutional crisis" that could end up in the 
California or U.S. supreme court.
"You are treading into the territory of asking a court to make judgment on 
the rules and the law governing the rights of the Legislature," said state 
Sen. Steve Peace, D-El Cajon. "It is a separation of powers issue of the 
highest order." 
Representatives from Enron, a power marketer based in Houston, said they are 
merely concerned that the committee has violated their due process rights. 
Enron and another company, Mirant, were initially found in contempt by the 
committee June 28 for refusing to turn over thousands of pages of documents 
that had been subpoenaed June 11. 
But the committee offered the companies a reprieve. If they complied with the 
subpoenas, signed confidentiality agreements and set up a document depository 
in Sacramento by Tuesday, the contempt findings would be expunged. 
Committee attorney Laurence Drivon reported at the hearing that Mirant had 
complied with the requirements, and had set up a document depository in the 
U.S. Bank building downtown. 
Mirant spokesman Patrick Dorinson said 159,000 pages of documents had been 
turned over in 44 boxes as of Wednesday morning. 
As a result, the panel voted to purge the contempt findings against Mirant, 
but said it would review the company's compliance again in about 30 days. 
Enron, however, did not turn over any documents or sign a confidentiality 
agreement since the last hearing, Drivon said, and negotiations yielded 
little progress. On a 6-0 vote, the panel agreed to move forward with 
contempt proceedings against Enron. 
As early as next week, the committee will forward a report to the Senate, 
which will vote on the contempt findings and levy punishments that could 
range from jail time for company officials to steep fines. 
The panel said Enron could still purge the contempt findings if it complies 
with the subpoena before the report is forwarded. 
But company officials fired back at the committee, accusing members of 
unfairly singling out Enron and treating it differently from other energy 
companies. 
"It is exceedingly difficult to discern whether the committee's actions are 
designed to uncover the facts underlying the price spikes in California's 
wholesale electric power market, or to create a convenient political 
scapegoat to shoulder the blame for California's policy mistakes," one 
official wrote to the committee. 
All along, Enron officials have said they have several objections to the 
committee's process. They believe the panel is violating the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission's jurisdiction in its investigation; that it isn't 
entitled to documents that are stored outside California; and that it doesn't 
have the right to the confidential information and trade secrets in the 
documents. 
They also argue that their due process rights have been violated because they 
received no response to their written objections to the subpoena before the 
June 28 contempt vote. 
The committee chairman, Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, overruled most of their 
objections Wednesday. However, Enron officials argued it's unfair for a 
committee member to rule on their objections. 
"It is a foregone conclusion that the objections are going to be overruled," 
Enron lawyer Michael Kirby said at the hearing. 
Officials believe an impartial third party should determine the merits of 
their concerns, which was a primary reason the company filed the lawsuit, 
said Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne. 
In the lawsuit, Enron seeks a court injunction to end contempt proceedings 
until the company's objections "have been duly considered and ruled upon by 
an impartial hearing officer." 
But Dunn said the Legislature's investigations are different from court 
inquiries, and so are its procedures. "The same due process concerns 
applicable to a court proceeding are not equally applicable to an 
investigation by the Legislature," he said. 
He denied the committee had singled out Enron, and said he believes Enron's 
lawsuit is really asking the court to force the Legislature to end its 
investigation. 
The committee is scheduled to consider contempt findings against other power 
companies next week. 
"Enron (has) raised, potentially, a constitutional crisis with this 
litigation," Dunn said. 
Constitutional scholar Clark Kelso said legislators clamoring about a 
constitutional crisis may be exaggerating. But Kelso, a professor at McGeorge 
School of Law in Sacramento, believes the suit should be dismissed because it 
is premature. He said the contempt process is still under way in the Capitol, 
and has yet to be acted upon by the Senate. 
Reacting to Enron's claims that an impartial third party should hear its 
objections, Kelso also disagreed. "A court is not going to hold a Senate 
committee to the same standard of impartiality it would hold a judge to," he 
said.

California Senate Committee Pushes Enron Contempt Citation Forward

Dow Jones Newswires 
LOS ANGELES -- A California Senate committee voted Wednesday to forward to 
the full Senate a contempt charge against Enron Corp. because the company 
refuses to provide certain financial documents for an investigation into 
wholesale power prices in the state.
If Enron is deemed to be in contempt by the full Senate, the legislators will 
vote on punishments that could include fines against the company or 
incarceration for company executives. 
"When Enron decides it is so important to keep its information private, I can 
only assume there is much more there to find than I can imagine," said Sen. 
Steve Peace (D., El Cajon), a member of the Senate Select Committee to 
Investigate Market Manipulation. 
Enron (ENE) filed a lawsuit Tuesday to stop the Senate's subpoena of 
financial records, saying the documents were outside of California's 
jurisdiction. 
The Houston company also is likely to legally contest the contempt charge, an 
Enron attorney said during Wednesday's hearings. 
The market manipulation committee will forward its contempt report to the 
full Senate by early next week, at the earliest, said Sen. Joe Dunn (D., 
Santa Ana), chairman of the committee. 
If at any point between now and then Enron decides to comply with the 
committee's requests, the contempt charge will be dropped, Sen. Dunn said. 
The committee also voted not to recommend a contempt charge for Mirant Corp 
(MIR), which agreed to provide financial documents Wednesday morning shortly 
before the hearing. 
The documents sought by Mr. Dunn's committee include information on bidding 
and pricing behavior in the state's electricity markets. The committee 
originally was poised to cite eight electricity generators for contempt, but 
all except Enron have since agreed to provide the requested information.

Duke Energy Asked to Allow Release of Data Power: Senator says the generator 
is refusing to make public some information crucial to the price-gouging 
probe. Firm says it's complying.
CARL INGRAM

SACRAMENTO -- The chairman of a Senate committee probing suspected price 
gouging during the California energy crisis charged Monday that Duke Energy 
is refusing to allow him to make public information key to his investigation. 
Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana) said Duke has made the price bidding information 
from its Chula Vista plant available to committee members and staffers. But 
under a federal confidentiality rule, the data cannot be made public without 
Duke's consent.
The documents concern the Chula Vista plant, which former employees have 
alleged was ramped up and down to drive up power prices during three days in 
January. However, state records show that the agency overseeing the 
electricity grid ordered those gyrations to keep the power flowing throughout 
the state. 
Dunn said Duke's refusal thwarts the committee's investigation and efforts to 
enact possible remedial legislation because the confidential information 
cannot be shared with others in the Legislature or the public. 
Dunn said Duke cited a rule of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that 
gives the company the authority to decide which records it makes public and 
which stay secret. 
"The only one who can release the data is Duke. We agreed to be bound by what 
is provided in the FERC tariff, nothing more or less," he said. 
Former Employees Tell of Maneuvers 
Dunn noted that the committee is considering trying to obtain the information 
elsewhere and "release it over Duke's objections." 
Three former workers at the Duke plant near Chula Vista testified last month 
under oath that the plant, among other things, was ramped up and down in what 
seemed to be an effort to maximize revenue during the Jan. 16-18 emergency. 
But Duke countered immediately that it had merely obeyed orders of the 
California Independent System Operator, which keeps the state's electricity 
grid in balance. Duke later provided Cal-ISO documents backing up its 
explanation. 
Duke executives insisted that the former employees failed to provide a full 
picture of the plant's operation during the three days. 
But Dunn, chairman of the select Senate committee on alleged price gouging, 
said Monday that by refusing to authorize release of all the subpoenaed data, 
Duke was guilty of the same tactics. 
"Duke is trying to draw the impression that it has [provided] the full 
picture. But they are fully aware that we cannot draw any final conclusions 
until all that data has been released. That hasn't occurred," Dunn said. 
To make a determination whether the Chula Vista power was withheld to drive 
up prices, Dunn said, the committee must publicly examine "the bids Duke 
submitted from which the ISO issued orders to the plant." They include the 
expensive hour-ahead and day-ahead markets, he said. 
Duke, a North Carolina-based wholesaler that operates several plants in 
California, noted that it considers the information proprietary and 
off-limits to legislators not on the committee. 
Duke spokesman Tom Williams insisted that the generator is attempting to 
comply with the committee's demands. But he was unable to say whether Duke 
would agree to make the bidding documents public along with other records the 
committee plans to turn over. 
"We are complying now," Williams said. "There is some suggestion that we are 
leaving stuff out when we have not had a chance to testify. . . . I don't 
know what we are ultimately going to do." 
The committee had threatened to cite eight wholesale generators unless they 
provide pricing and bidding documents by Wednesday. Six, including Duke, have 
said they would comply to avoid a contempt citation. Two, Enron and Mirant, 
were cited. 
Dunn said the committee on Wednesday likely will give companies that are 
trying to comply an extra week to do so, but others probably will be formally 
charged with contempt in a report to the full Senate. The upper house is the 
final arbiter of such issues. 
Although there is scant precedent for levying penalties against those cited 
for contempt, Dunn said he favors imposing severe fines. In 1929, the most 
recent case, a cement company executive was sent to jail.

Calif Pwr Plant Outages Dn In Jun, Still Top 2000 -Report

07/09/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The average amount of electricity generating 
capacity unavailable to California due to breakdowns or planned maintenance 
at power plants fell by half in June from the three previous months, the 
California Energy Commission said Monday. 
But the 6,758 megawatts of generation that was off line on average last month 
was still more than twice the 2,683 MW off line in June 2000.
Generators, including Duke Energy (DUK), Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) and Dynegy 
Inc. (DYN), said that's because the half-century-old power plants ran at 
maximum capacity during the past year to help cover the state's massive 
electricity shortfall. 
Generators said there's nothing suspicious about the increased amount of 
capacity that went off line this year. In fact, they schedule maintenance a 
year in advance. 
"We ran the heck out of our plants," said Duke spokesman Tom Williams. "These 
plants are about 50 years old. They broke down because we ran them so hard." 
In addition, about 5,000 MW of generation operated by small power producers 
known as qualifying facilities shut down their units this spring, because 
they were owed for power supplied to Edison International (EIX) unit Southern 
Californa Edison and PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric. Those 
plants began operating again late last month after striking deals to settle 
their claims. 
State officials, however, believe the generators have purposely kept their 
power plants off line to drive-up wholesale electricity prices. State Sen. 
Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, said it appears generators have the ability to 
influence wholesale power prices and have done so by forcing some of their 
units off line. 
"Whether they did it in a concerted fashion is the question we're trying to 
answer," Dunn said. "But it's clear that some of these plants may have shut 
down for unnecessary maintenance." 
The amount of generation off line between March and May averaged 14,026 MW, 
according to the commission's report. Since January, average outages each

More Employees To Testify Vs Calif Generators -Senator
By Jason Leopold

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- Current and former power plant employees are 
expected to testify soon against California's major power suppliers, alleging 
the companies manipulated the state's wholesale electricity market in an 
effort to boost power prices, the head of the state Senate committee 
investigating the claims told Dow Jones Newswires. 
The whistleblowers are non-management employees who work for or were once 
employed by Reliant Energy Inc. (REI), Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Mirant Corp. (MIR), 
Williams Cos. (WMB) and Duke Energy (DUK), said state Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa 
Ana, chairman of the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price 
Manipulation.
"We have been dealing with a whole number of whistleblowers to provide their 
view, whether good or bad," Dunn said. "These are whistleblowers from 
virtually all five generators who are either current or former employees." 
California is seeking $9 billion in refunds from suppliers, which it accuses 
of price gouging. The state also hopes to pursue criminal charges against 
power company executives. 
So far, Dunn's committee has only heard testimony from former employees of 
Duke. The testimony against the other generators could come as early as July 
10, Dunn said. Some of the whistleblowers are concerned about losing their 
jobs or being blacklisted once they testify, he said. 
Two former employees of Duke's South Bay power plant are slated to testify 
Thursday before the Senate committee that Duke reduced output at the 
706-megawatt power plant to drive up wholesale power prices. 
Last month, three former Duke power plant employees testified that Duke 
tossed out spare parts and "ramped down" two turbines during power 
emergencies. The men produced control room logs to back up their testimony. 
"The testimony by the new whistleblowers is headed in the same direction as 
the other three (Duke) employees," Dunn said, adding that evidence may 
include some control room logs that show power plants being ramped up and 
down. 
The California Independent System Operator, manager of the state's power 
grid, admitted last week that Duke was acting on its orders when the company 
reduced output at the plant, but said it issued those orders because Duke's 
power prices were too high. 
Generators Deny Manipulation 

Energy companies will have an opportunity to give their side of the story to 
the committee by the end of the month, Dunn said. 
The companies deny allegations they manipulated the market. 
"We have not withheld," said Mirant spokesman Pat Dorinson. "We have not 
manipulated the market. We follow dispatch instructions given to us by the 
ISO." 
Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel said the company hasn't been told by Dunn's 
office that anyone would be making specific allegations about its operations. 
Repeating an argument used by Duke, Stengel said plant employees weren't 
aware of the big picture. 
"No one at our power plants is in a position to know why the plants ramp up 
and down," Stengel said. "Communication is between the ISO and the Dynegy 
marketing staff. We take dispatch orders from the ISO." 
Dunn said additional employees have come forward since the Duke employees 
first testified and that his staff interviews potential whistleblowers. 
"We see if they have something to add to the investigation," Dunn said. 
Despite the emergence of new witnesses, Dunn wouldn't claim to have found a 
"smoking gun." 
"I tend to shy away from that term," Dunn said. "To be honest, if a (smoking 
gun) exists, I doubt we will ever get our hands on it." 
Dunn's committee started its hearings three months ago. The senator said he 
has concluded that generators have the ability to set the price of wholesale 
electricity and should be stripped of their ability to charge market rates. 
"We still have to hear from the generators," Dunn said. "But it seems very 
clear that the Big Five generators have market power. The question is how do 
they exercise market power and what is the impact on the price? If market 
power has been exercised in a concerted fashion, that's a potential antitrust 
charge. That's illegal." 
The committee will continue its investigation through the summer break, which 
begins July 15, and expects to complete its probe by September, Dunn said.

Power producers in contempt Energy Companies withhold documents in probe of 
possible price fixing. Series: energy.0628

Sacramento Two power producers were found in contempt Thursday by a Senate 
committee investigating possible price manipulation after company officials 
refused to turn over thousands of subpoenaed documents. Such an action hadn't 
been taken since 1929, when the Legislature was investigating the cement 
industry. 
Enron Corp. and Mirant Energy both failed to reach an agreement by Thursday's 
deadline to turn over internal memos, business strategies, contracts for 
electricity sales, and volumes of other documents that will reveal how 
they've run their businesses under deregulation.
Mirant spokesman Patrick Dorinson said his company hopes to reach an 
agreement with the committee within two weeks and said company officials 
would continue to negotiate in good faith. 
But Enron was defiant. No company official attended the hearing. Instead, San 
Diego attorney Michael Kirby faxed a four-page letter, announcing for the 
first time that the company has no intention of handing over documents. Enron 
challenged the committee's legal authority to investigate the industry and 
said that most of the documents were stored outside California, so the 
committee had no legal right to ask for them. 
Enron officials refused further comment. The response outraged Sen. Steve 
Peace, D-Chula Vista, who said Enron should face harsher punishment than the 
rest and warned other power producers to not follow Enron's lead. 
"These guys make the tobacco guys look like paupers," Peace said. "(The 
tobacco industry was) nowhere near as slick as these guys." 
Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, chairman of the Senate Select Committee to 
Investigate Market Manipulation, said that if the two companies don't comply 
by July 10, the full Senate will likely be asked to hold them in contempt. 
The Senate could order the immediate delivery of the documents in addition to 
fines and other penalties. 
The other five companies that faced a possible contempt citation Thursday 
were given an extension to July 10 because they were starting to turn over 
documents or had agreed to a method of turning them over. 
Those companies include Dynegy Inc., which handed over 18,000 pages Thursday, 
and Reliant Energy, which turned over 1,800, Dunn said. 
Duke Energy and Williams Cos. agreed to turn over the requested documents to 
a central location in Sacramento, provided a confidentiality agreement can be 
reached. AES Corp. was not found in contempt because Williams' compliance 
likely covers the company; Williams pays AES to run the plants and sells the 
energy the plants produce.

TWO COMPANIES FOUND IN CONTEMPT OF LEGISLATURE; ENRON, MIRANT HAVE 12 DAYS TO 
WORK OUT DEAL TO PROVIDE DOCUMENTS

SACRAMENTO -- California lawmakers found two companies in contempt on 
Thursday for refusing to turn over thousands of pages of documents as part of 
an investigation into possible electricity price gouging, the first time 
since the Great Depression that a committee has resorted to such a drastic 
measure. 
After weeks of fruitless negotiations, a special state Senate committee 
unanimously found Enron and Mirant -- two of the state's largest private 
power providers -- in contempt of the Legislature.
''These companies have shown contempt for the people of California, and it 
adds to the strong suspicion that they have a lot to hide,'' said Sen. Wes 
Chesbro, D-Santa Rosa. 
Five other energy companies avoided a similar fate with a series of 11th-hour 
faxes, phone calls and deliveries to the Capitol meant to signal their 
willingness to cooperate. 
But lawmakers offered sharp criticism of Enron and Mirant. ''Am I prepared to 
throw someone in jail for non-compliance? Hell, yes,'' said Sen. Bill Morrow, 
the top Republican on the committee. 
The companies have 12 days to work out an agreement with the committee or 
face punishment. Because the action is taken so rarely, there is little 
guidance for lawmakers on how to proceed. 
Any punishment must be approved by the full Senate, which has wide latitude 
to order the arrest of company officials, impose financial penalties or take 
some other action. 
An attorney for Mirant sought to avert the vote with a last-minute agreement, 
rejected by the committee, to turn over some documents. Enron's response was 
a four-page letter in which it questioned the committee's right to examine 
its business practices. 
The last time the state Senate took such an action came in 1929 when 
lawmakers ordered the arrest and brief imprisonment of a cement company 
executive who refused to speak to them about alleged price fixing. 
More recently, a state Assembly committee investigating former Insurance 
Commissioner Charles Quackenbush ordered the arrest last summer of a witness 
who failed to appear at a hearing. The witness came to the Capitol several 
hours later. 
The Senate committee has been trying for months to gain access to 
internaldocuments. 
All seven companies fought the requests and asked the committee to adopt 
broad restrictions on what material it would make public. But the committee 
refused. 
In light of the stalemate, the committee vowed to hold the companies in 
contempt. 
Five companies -- Duke Energy, Dynegy, Reliant, Williams and AES -- managed 
to ward off a contempt vote by turning over, or agreeing to turn over, 
documents under the less-stringent secrecy protections offered by the 
committee in May. 
As the hearing got under way, Reliant turned over 1,800 pages of what it 
called non-confidential documents. A few hours later, Dynegy delivered seven 
boxes filled with more than 18,000 documents. 
Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Garden Grove, called the last-minute flurry of activity 
''unfortunate and disturbing'' and said his committee will spend the next two 
weeks looking over the documents to see if they satisfy the panel's demands. 
Should the companies balk on their last-minute agreements, Dunn said, the 
committee will take a second look at finding them in contempt. {CHART} CHART:

FIRMS FACE CONTEMPT RULING FOR WITHHOLDING DOCUMENTS

SACRAMENTO -- A special legislative committee looking into alleged 
electricity price gouging is poised to take the almost unprecedented step of 
declaring power companies in contempt for failing to turn over thousands of 
pages of documents. 
State Sen. Joe Dunn is expected to grill the major power companies at a 
hearing today for refusing to turn over records the Garden Grove Democrat and 
his committee want to examine.
''We have reached the end of our patience,'' Dunn said Wednesday. 
If the committee declares the companies in contempt, Senate aides said, it 
would be the first time in 72 years that the Legislature has taken such a 
step. 
Just what might happen to the companies remains unclear. State law gives 
lawmakers broad, but vague, power to impose financial penalties on the 
companies, arrest witnesses or take stronger action. 
The full Democrat-controlled state Senate would have to decide what 
punishment, if any, to impose. 
Dunn and his committee have taken a lead in the Capitol in exploring 
allegations that power companies, including Duke Energy, Reliant, Mirant, 
Williams and Dynegy, used unethical or illegal tactics to drive up the price 
of power and rake in billions in profits. 
For nearly three months, the committee has been working with company lawyers 
to gain access to thousands of pages of documents. After weeks of stalemate, 
the committee issued a 15-page subpoena earlier this month to the companies. 
But the companies have balked. 
Tom Williams, a Duke spokesman, said his company was unwilling to turn over 
information until the committee agreed to some restrictions. 
''We have not gotten adequate confidentiality agreements from Sen. Dunn's 
committee and that's a big stumbling block,'' he said. 
Dunn said he is willing to protect company trade secrets but will not agree 
to broad confidentiality rules. 
According to Senate aides, the last time the Senate found someone in contempt 
was in 1929, when lawmakers ordered the arrest of a witness in a price fixing 
investigation. The state Assembly made similar threats last year during an 
investigation of former Insurance Commissioner Charles Quackenbush. Exactly 
one year ago, the Assembly committee ordered the arrest of a witness who 
failed to appear. The witness appeared several hours later.

Two power firms held in contempt by state Senate panel / Enron, Mirant cited 
over subpoenaed documents

A state Senate committee held Enron and Mirant corporations in contempt 
yesterday for not turning over subpoenaed documents as six other energy 
companies made frantic, last-minute deals to comply with the lawmakers' 
orders. 
The contempt finding is the first of its kind since 1929 when a Senate panel 
investigating price fixing in cement prices briefly jailed a Portland 
businessman for refusing to comply with a subpoena.
"Jailing is an option and we preserve all options at this point," said state 
Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, the chairman of the committee investigating 
charges of price manipulation in the wholesale electricity market. 
Although Dunn's committee voted 5 to 0 to find the companies in contempt, the 
panel will decide July 10 whether to ask the full Senate to issue sanctions 
against Enron and Mirant. 
Dunn's committee requested documents from power providers in early April. 
When the requests were ignored, the committee issued subpoenas on June 11 
asking generators for documents covering business plans, operations, risk 
management, and investment strategies. 
Based on their pledges yesterday to cooperate with the committee, six energy 
providers escaped contempt citations and were given until July 10 to comply 
with the orders. All of the companies cited concerns about confidentiality of 
the documents. 
As committee members met, generators' lawyers stepped into hallways and made 
hurried calls from cell phones to their corporate headquarters, and one 
company delivered a truckload of documents to the Capitol. 
"While we have received certain documents today, we have no idea what has 
been given to us," Dunn said. "That it has taken until today to get these 
responses is unfortunate and disturbing." 
Enron drew most of the wrath from the committee after sending only a letter 
questioning the committee's jurisdiction. The company also criticized an 
investigation by Attorney General Bill Lockyer, which company officials 
called "fatally and irreparably compromised" by what it said was blatant 
bias. 
Lockyer has said in published articles that the heads of some of the power 
generating companies, like Enron, should go to jail. 
Lawmakers took Enron to task for not bothering to send a representative to 
the hearing. 
"There is clearly a stark contrast in the conduct in the marketplace between 
Enron and other companies," said Sen. Steve Peace, D-El Cajon. "The irony of 
the Enron letter is that they were the architect of the whole (deregulation) 
concept." 
An Enron spokeswoman reached after the hearing declined to comment. 
An attorney for Duke told lawmakers his company would agree to place all 
requested documents in a Sacramento depository for the committee to review. 
He also agreed that except for a few minor changes the company would agree to 
a proposed confidentiality agreement. 
Under the plan, information such as trade secrets and other proprietary 
information would be kept confidential and companies would receive a 10-day 
notice if the committee planned to make public any confidential materials. 
The company would then have that time to ask for a court order preventing any 
release. 
A lawyer for Williams Energy agreed to the same conditions as Duke, and an 
attorney for Mirant pursued a similar strategy but stopped short of pledging 
that all documents would be made available. 
A Mirant spokesman said later that the company has compiled thousands of 
pages of documents and will continue to work with the committee. 
"We want some assurance from committee that the documents will not end up in 
some public forum where they could be misused," said Patrick Dorinson. 
If Mirant or Enron comply with the subpoena before the July 10 hearing, the 
contempt citation will be rescinded, Dunn said. 
As the committee met, it received boxes from Dynegy containing 18,000 pages, 
plus 1,800 documents from Reliant. Two other companies, AES and NRG Energy 
Inc., were given an extension because the requests for their documents were 
made later. 
The committee will review the documents before July 10 to see if those 
companies have complied, Dunn said. 
The last time the Legislature found someone in contempt was 72 years ago when 
H.T. Battelle of the Pacific Portland Cement Co. was thrown in jail for 
ignoring a Senate subpoena. 
Dunn said it is not clear what the Senate would do in this case. 
The Democratic lawmaker's committee made national headlines last week when 
three former employees of a Duke power plant testified that they were told to 
ramp power production up and down in an apparent attempt to manipulate 
electricity prices. Duke countered that it was merely following the orders of 
the state's power grid operators.

USA: Calif. Senate panel cites generators for contempt.

06/28/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

SACRAMENTO, Calif., June 28 (Reuters) - A California state Senate committee 
voted to cite Mirant Corp . and Enron Corp for contempt on Thursday after the 
energy generators failed to supply confidential documents as required by 
subpoena. 
The committee, which is seeking evidence of power price manipulation in 
California's chaotic energy market, voted unanimously for the contempt 
citations after Mirant and Enron did not produce the required papers.
"The step we took today is historic," said state Sen. Joe Dunn, Democratic 
chair of the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Market Manipulation. "We 
haven't done this in 72 years." 
Dunn said his committee would draw up a contempt report which would be 
forwarded to the Senate by July 10. 
The full Senate, in turn, will be charged with determining what sanctions to 
impose - which could range from renewed orders for documents to fines to jail 
time for individuals determined to have obstructed compliance with the 
subpoenas. 
The committee postponed action on possible contempt citations for other 
energy companies, including Reliant , Dynegy , Williams Cos , Duke Energy , 
AES Corp and NRG Energy , giving them until July 10 to follow through on 
promises to provide the required documentation. 
Dunn said the citations against Mirant and Enron - which would be the first 
imposed by California's state Senate since 1929 - would be vacated if the 
companies comply with the subpoenas by the July 10 deadline. 
The companies have objected to providing the confidential materials, which 
they argue includes proprietary information on bidding and pricing for 
California energy purchases that, if disclosed, could damage their 
competitive ability. 
Enron, in particular, has rejected the committee's authority, saying it keeps 
its documentation in Texas and is therefore outside California jurisdiction.

SACRAMENTO The Senate might exercise its contempt powers for the first time 
in more than 70 years if electricity producers fail today to obey a subpoena 
ordering them to turn over documents that would provide an inside look at 
their business practices, lawmakers said Wednesday. 
The power producers are flying in representatives to appear before a Senate 
committee today, but they are not expected to turn over any of the documents, 
which were first requested in April.
They are seeking a protective order that would ban the committee from 
disclosing the information to the public or to other government agencies, 
said Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, 
which represents many of the major power producers. 
"They want to have some control over these confidential documents, and they 
have this right," Ackerman said. "The Senate has subpoena powers, but they 
also have obligations." 
State Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana -- who chairs the Senate committee that 
issued the subpoenas -- said he hopes the power producers will comply, but if 
they don't he'll be forced to take more aggressive actions. 
There are two possibilities, including the reissuance of subpoenas, this time 
naming company officials instead of a faceless corporation. The full Senate 
would have the power then to throw the named person in jail, as it did in 
1929 when the Legislature was investigating the cement industry for possible 
collusion and price- fixing. In that case, the state Supreme Court stood 
behind the Senate's authority. 
The focus of Dunn's committee is similar to the 1929 investigation. He is 
looking into accusations of collusion and price fixing, this time among some 
of the nation's largest electricity producers. 
Dunn said the other possible action is to ask the full Senate to hold the 
companies in contempt, and order that they turn over the documents or face 
possible court action. Failure to comply with a legislative subpoena is a 
misdemeanor. The Senate also could probably ask the court to intervene in the 
dispute, said Matthew Jacobs, an attorney who's studied the Legislature's 
powers in this area. 
"It is my sincere hope that we can avoid the ultimate penalty for 
noncompliance, which is to jail the individual to comply," Dunn said. "There 
is no legal basis for refusing to comply with the legislative subpoena based 
on an assertion of confidentiality." 
Senate Leader John Burton, D-San Francisco, said the Senate will likely 
support whatever action the committee asks it to take. 
"The Senate would probably support what they would want to do," Burton said. 
"If they make the case, then we will probably take the action that they 
believe is appropriate." 
Jacobs, who served as special counsel to the Assembly during the hearings 
that led to the resignation of former Insurance Commissioner Chuck 
Quakenbush, said the Legislature's subpoena power is the greatest when a 
specific person is named. 
"The (Senate) sergeant-at- arms goes out and places the person under arrest 
and takes him down to the county jail," said Jacobs. "If they comply with the 
subpoena, they can get out of jail. You can't throw a corporation in jail." 
In the 1929 case, the sergeant-at-arms arrested H.T. Battelle, secretary of 
the Pacific Portland Cement Co. The company protested, saying the Senate 
didn't have such authority, but the Supreme Court sided with the Senate. 
Battelle was forced to comply, according to a copy of the published decision. 
Dunn said since Battelle's case is the only trailblazing that's been done on 
the Senate's contempt and subpoena power, it will rely on the advice of the 
Legislative Counsel's Office as to its options should the generators fail to 
turn over documents. 
Power producers are angry with Dunn and his committee's aggressive approach 
to unearthing information. During a committee hearing last week -- which 
showcased three former power-plant workers who have accused the producers of 
wrongdoing -- the power merchants' group labeled the committee's work a 
"witch hunt."

Testimonies point to power manipulation Electricity Davis calls account of 
ex-Duke Energy workers a potential `smoking gun.' Series: energy.0623

SACRAMENTO Three former workers at a Duke Energy plant moved from obscurity 
into the national spotlight Friday as they became the first eyewitnesses to 
provide sworn testimony accusing a generator of unethical -- and perhaps 
illegal -- conduct in California's energy crisis. 
Gov. Gray Davis called the men "heroes," and before the first witness even 
completed his testimony, he invited them and their families to have breakfast 
with him Monday.
"If these allegations are true, it might be the smoking gun we thought 
existed all along." 
With 10 television crews and twice as many radio and print reporters 
recording one of the most dramatic Capitol hearings in recent history, the 
men spent six hours before a special Senate committee that is investigating 
whether price-fixing and collusion among generators either fueled or created 
the crisis. 
The accounts of mechanics Ed Edwards and Glenn Johnson and control- room 
operator Jimmy Olkjer included accusations of equipment tampering at a Chula 
Vista plant in order to withhold production and drive up electricity prices. 
The testimony drew an immediate response. A consortium of power generators 
labeled the hearing a "witch hunt" in a letter that reached committee 
chairman Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, even before the last witness had 
finished testifying. Dunn diverted briefly from the questioning to read the 
letter aloud and then dismissed the charge as "nonsense." 
Duke spokesman Tom Wil liams said the former employees' testimony should be 
questioned because when Duke assembled its own team this spring, they were 
not hired. "It's absolutely absurd," Williams said of the allegations. 
But Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamente said he believes the accounts of the three men 
are solid. He believes that Duke perhaps didn't hire them because they were 
at the top of their pay scale, each of them working more than two decades in 
the business. 
"I think they provide clear evidence of tampering at the facility," said 
Bustamente. "They have distinguished careers and service records and they are 
coming forward as good Californians." 
The testimony of the three men recounted much of the same information they 
provided to The Orange County Register and CBS News on Thursday, but expanded 
it and added a few revelations. 
Dunn believes the most important testimony focused on a series of 
control-room logs for three days in mid-January that show how frequently Duke 
ordered the "ramping up" and "ramping down" of their generators. 
Johnson called it "yo-yoing" and said the charts on the generators that track 
production levels started looking like "cardiac monitors" after Duke took 
over the plant. 
The significance of the constant ramping up and down is two-fold: It could be 
used as partial evidence to prove allegations that Duke manipulated its 
production levels to drive up prices. And it backs up testimony from the 
former employees that this behavior led to the erosion of good equipment, 
causing further breakdowns and outages that would affect supply. 
Duke officials said most of this ramping up and down was on orders of the 
California Independent Systems Operator, which operates the state's power 
grid, but they could not quantify what percentage of the decisions were their 
own. 
"This amount of ramping up and down is unusual," said Dunn. "There were 
decisions made in three-, four-, five- minute intervals. I don't think that 
kind of micromanagement comes from ISO." 
The three men -- whom Duke had inherited from former plant operator San Diego 
Gas & Electric -- said they were shut out of decision- making that led to the 
powering down of generators. But after a while, they said, they were able to 
pick up on the longtime Duke employees' jargon and began to make their own 
interpretations for the company's motives behind powering down. 
"They would say they were `down for economics.' That was thrown around a 
lot," said Johnson, who added that he came to believe it was done 
deliberately to "reduce load to boast prices." 
Again, Duke officials deny these allegations, saying they never powered down 
generators to "game" the market. 
Sen. Steve Peace, D-El Cajon, said the testimony convinced him that Duke 
Energy is in violation of its lease with the San Diego Unified Port 
Authority, which owns the plant. 
The lease, which Peace read from during the hearing, requires that Duke use 
"prudent utility practices" in its management of the plant - - something that 
both Edwards and Johnson said was violated as routine maintenance was 
abandoned and generators fell into disrepair. 
If found in violation of the lease -- which the port authority is 
investigating -- Duke presumably could lose control of the plant. 
Williams said Duke has improved, rather than downgraded, the service record 
of the plant. 
On Thursday, the employees said in interviews with the Register that they 
were ordered to fill Dumpsters with valuable new parts that were sold as 
scrap metal. The parts were later needed to perform repairs, and since they 
were not on hand, generators were not able to operate at full capacity. 
Olkjer, the control-room operator, said he also noticed a correlation between 
Duke's decision to ramp down its generators and a precipitous rise in energy 
prices. He believes that the Duke was able to influence prices by withholding 
power. 
"None of these allegations are true," said Williams. "Many of the parts were 
obsolete, so we did clear them out ... we did nothing unethical." 
Dunn said the next committee hearing, in mid-July, will provide power 
generators with an opportunity to respond to allegations that they have 
price-gouged Californians. He said that so far, three months after asking for 
and then serving subpoenas for documents, the committee has received nothing 
from the generators. 
"They have also refused to agree to a non-destruct order for documents. We 
want them to promise to not destroy documents, which could provide critical 
evidence, and they will not do it," Dunn said adding that the contempt 
charges are a possibility. 
Dunn said if the committee finds evidence of criminal wrongdoing, it will 
hand it over to Attorney General Bill Lockyer. If it finds evidence of 
misconduct that shows the market is being wrongly manipulated, it will use 
that information to push for system reforms and refunds for overcharges. 
After the hearing, the men said they were amazed and frightened by the media 
circus and by attention they received. 
"I'm shocked," said Johnson, who Friday was also awarded a Medal of Valor by 
the California National Guard after a three-year delay because of

SACRAMENTO -- After months of resisting disclosure, Gov. Gray Davis on Friday 
released 38 long-term power contracts that aides said show the administration 
is deftly managing the energy crisis, but that critics warn contain clauses 
and costs that may burden consumers with unpredictably high prices for years. 
Provisions in some of the contracts protect generators from new state taxes, 
shield them from potential action by federal regulators and give them a break 
on environmental costs. At the same time, the documents are so heavily 
censored in crucial areas that it is impossible to fully assess their impact 
on the state and its residents.
State officials insist that the complex agreements, extending as much as 20 
years and costing an estimated $43 billion, already have slowed the 
hemorrhaging of state spending on power and sheltered consumers from wild 
electricity price swings in the future. 
"These provide a major building block for lifting this energy crisis," Davis' 
top energy advisor, S. David Freeman, said as a 600-page stack of agreements 
was made public in response to a court order. "That was our longer-term 
strategy. We implemented it, and it's worked." 
The governor, questioned after a public appearance at Mather Air Force Base, 
echoed his advisor's optimism, but added: "I'm under no illusions. I think 
the summer is going to be hot and the peak prices will spike up." 
For months, Davis has publicly vilified the generators with whom his 
administration has now become contractually bound. Asked whether his nemeses 
negotiated in good faith, the governor said: "I do not think the generators 
have our best interests at heart. . . . They're laughing all the way to the 
bank. My job is to fight back." 
Davis has a heavy political investment in the pacts, which the state began 
negotiating in January as blackouts hit, power prices soared and the state's 
large utilities slipped toward insolvency. 
Crediting the contracts, Davis aides noted the state was paying an average of 
$332 a megawatt hour for power in January, but only $179 this month. The 
contracts call for an average price of about $85 per megawatt hour over the 
next five years and about $69 over the next 10 years. 
Critics have noted that the state's current average costs under the contracts 
exceed those now available on the daily market. But Davis contends the 
current reduced prices are largely a result of his contracting strategy. 
Partly because of the secrecy Davis imposed on the deals, they have become a 
focal point of suspicion over his handling of the crisis. News 
organizations--including The Times--and Republican officeholders sued to get 
them. Consumer groups, meanwhile, complained about being hit with historic 
utility rate increases for deals no one could examine. 
The controversy seemed to intensify Friday, despite efforts by the governor's 
team to portray the agreements as a major tactical victory against 
out-of-state power marketers who exploited the state's flawed deregulation 
scheme. 
GOP Leader Attacks 'Sweetheart Deals' 
Assembly Republican Leader Dave Cox of Fair Oaks, whose staff pored over the 
documents, attacked the governor for brokering "sweetheart deals for the 
generators." 
Even a key Democrat, state Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Garden Grove), expressed serious 
concerns about a number of provisions in the deals that seem to offer special 
relief to generators. 
Some lawmakers and consumer groups pointed to provisions that would allow 
generators to shift the cost of new taxes to the state and possibly exempt 
the firms from a windfall profits tax. 
"It ups the ante as far as the ultimate burden that the contracts will place 
on the shoulders of California ratepayers and taxpayers," said Dunn, who is 
heading a special committee investigating alleged manipulation of the state's 
energy market. 
The senator said he also is concerned about provisions such as one negotiated 
with GWF Energy, which prevents the state from pressing any future claims 
with federal regulators regarding the company's profits. 
"It is very disconcerting that we would willingly give up the right to 
challenge any of these [prices]," Dunn said. 
Consumer advocate Harvey Rosenfield called some of the contract terms 
outrageous. Rosenfield, who heads the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer 
Rights in Santa Monica, said it was "bad enough" that the long-term contracts 
resulted in "high rates for Californians for a decade." He said Friday's 
disclosures pointed to other "giveaway" perks. 
Freeman, who formerly headed Los Angeles' Department of Water and Power, 
insisted that generators won no special windfall profit protections. The only 
tax increases generators can pass along to the state, he said, are those 
directly tied to production of the power in the contracts, such as new taxes 
on natural gas. 
"I'm not going to say some lawyer won't argue" that the generators will not 
claim they are exempt from a windfall profits tax. "But the contract is very 
clear and the law is very clear." 
Some of the pacts lock in specific prices, such as $58 a megawatt hour for 
around-the-clock power from Baltimore-based Constellation Energy Group. The 
Davis administration said those guard against price spikes in future years. 
Other contracts, officials said, balance the portfolio. They include deals 
such as those with Dynegy Inc., which tie prices to the cost of fuel in 
future years. 
A number of energy insiders found reason to praise the contracts. 
"The point of signing long-term contracts is not to get a great deal, it's to 
reduce risk" from the volatility of spot markets, said Severin Borenstein, 
director of the Energy Institute at UC Berkeley. 
Edison Cites Hedge Against Price Spike 
The long-term power contracts will be an important factor in limiting the 
state's exposure to future price spikes, said Bob Foster, senior vice 
president of public affairs for Rosemead-based Edison International, the 
corporate parent of Southern California Edison. 
"This was California's problem to begin with," Foster said. "You don't want 
to be buying a lot of power traded on the spot market. What we really need is 
a portfolio of contracts that range from one to seven years and that take out 
the volatility from a large percentage of the market." 
Davis advisors stressed that most of the contracted power also is linked to 
development of new California generating plants, a key part of the governor's 
drive to free the state from reliance on out-of-state power trading 
companies. 
About 60% to 70% of all the power that will be purchased in future years 
under the contracts will be from new plants. The agreements, Freeman said, 
helped developers obtain bank financing for their proposed plants. 
By nurturing new plants, the state is signaling energy companies that "this 
gravy train of high [prices] is not going to last forever," said Vikram 
Budhraja, California's lead consultant in the bargaining. 
But as analysts pored over the details, some challenged the governor's basic 
premise that the long-term deals were largely responsible for recent falling 
prices. They attribute the softening market to a host of other factors, 
including cooler weather, falling natural gas prices and more plants 
completing spring maintenance. 
In fact, some scholars say that the current prices simply prove that the 
state committed to paying the power companies too much for too long. 
"The governor's spin doctors claim that not entering into the contracts would 
have been gambling," said UC Irvine economist Peter Navarro. He said that in 
the years ahead, odds are are heavily against the contracts being a bargain. 
"That makes those contracts a long shot," he said, "which is gambling in the 
worst sense of the word." 
Analyst Sees Too Much Uncertainty in Contracts 
Reviewing contracts Friday, energy economist Robert Michaels of Cal State 
Fullerton said he was also troubled by the financial risks the state appears 
to be assuming in some contracts for power plant pollution control expenses. 
In some cases, he said, the state could be charged for costly emission 
control upgrades. 
"There's such uncertainty about what future state policy is going to be in 
terms of cost of permits, retrofit requirements and new technology," said 
Michaels, who reviewed the contracts at The Times' request. "I am not 
familiar with any power contracts where I've seen that. It strikes me as 
unusual." 
Assemblyman Tony Strickland (R-Thousand Oaks), who independently sued Davis 
to reveal the power contracts, said the public would not have been able to 
weigh such trade-offs if the governor had continued the secrecy. 
Davis relented Tuesday, a day before a San Diego Superior Court judge was to 
hear the public records challenge. 
Some complained the administration is still withholding key information. 
Attorneys for the news organizations who sued the administration will return 
to court later this month to argue for release of the redacted material. 
The released contracts blacked out the indexes used to set natural gas 
prices, the amount of natural gas needed to fire specific generators and 
which pipelines are being used to ship the gas. That's important because gas 
shipped into Southern California is more costly than gas shipped into 
Northern California. 
Additionally, the state is withholding information on whether the state or 
the generators should pay when there are breakdowns or congestion on the 
transmission system, resulting in a failure to deliver power. 
Documents' Release Doesn't Stop Dispute 
Experts said transmission-related provisions can be crucial to such contracts 
final costs. 
In arguing for continuing confidentiality, Davis maintained that the 
disclosure of detailed contract information would undercut the state's 
negotiators by tipping off competing generators. On Friday, however, some 
critics attributed to the move to politics. 
"If they were great contracts, they would have been released months ago," 
said Navarro of UC Irvine. 
But Davis' defenders, including Assemblyman Roderick Wright (D-Los Angeles), 
chairman of the Utilities and Commerce Committee, said the contracts 
accomplished exactly what they were intended to do: stabilize the price and 
supply of electricity. 
"If all of a sudden you dump all these contracts, and all this power went 
back into the spot market, guess what? We'd be in the same damn position we 
were in last year."

PG&E announces deals with smaller suppliers


(Published July 20, 2001) 
SAN FRANCISCO -- Two weeks after reaching a long-term agreement with a major 
electricity supplier, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. on Thursday announced 
similar pacts with 130 smaller alternative energy companies. 
The deals, which must be submitted to a federal bankruptcy judge for 
approval, are expected to provide about 1,600 megawatts at 5.37 cents per 
kilowatt hour -- a price set by the Public Utilities Commission for long-term 
agreements sealed by July 15. The total is about two-thirds of the 
electricity that the utility usually receives under contracts with 
alternative energy suppliers. 
The utility has promised to repay the 131 companies the $740 million it owes 
them when its plan goes into effect. 
It owes an additional $260 million to other small producers who have not 
settled. Some of those companies are trying to get out of PG&E contracts. 
--Claire Cooper 
County sues over bond sale
Monterey County officials sued the county's investment adviser for selling 
them $4.9 million in Pacific Gas and Electric Co. bonds as the utility was 
collapsing financially. 
PG&E defaulted on the bonds, which came due March 26, although it has paid 
the county $5,334 in interest, the county said in its lawsuit. 
The lawsuit, filed in San Francisco Superior Court, says Banc of America 
Securities sold the bonds to Monterey County on Dec. 11 even though the 
county "was seeking a conservative, low risk investment." 
At the time, the securities firm was aware that PG&E "was financially 
unstable and its securities subject to potential default," the lawsuit says. 
BofA Securities said the PG&E bonds were "similar in risk to investment in a 
certificate of deposit and less risky than an investment in treasury bonds," 
the suit says. 
BofA Securities couldn't be reached for comment. 
--Dale Kasler 






Dan Walters: Six months later, utility debts are still the toughest nut to 
crack 


(Published July 20, 2001) 
When Gov. Gray Davis and other state politicians finally became engaged in 
the energy crisis last January -- a half-year late -- the state's major 
investor-owned utilities had already amassed more than $13 billion in debt 
from runaway power costs and were out of credit. 
Davis and the Legislature launched a massive state power purchase program, a 
speed-up of new power plants, conservation subsidies and other actions, not 
all of which have been successful. But everyone involved knew that the 
utilities' debts, which had driven them to the brink of bankruptcy, would be 
the most complex and politically difficult aspect of the crisis. 
Six months later, that's still true. 
An administration team negotiated for weeks with Pacific Gas and Electric and 
Southern California Edison on schemes to retire their debts and bring them 
back to a creditworthy status. The talks with PG&E went nowhere, and three 
months ago, the huge San Francisco-based utility filed for bankruptcy 
protection. Davis, clearly concerned that Edison would follow, hammered out a 
deal with the smaller utility within hours. 
It was, by any standard, a sweet deal for Edison and its parent company, 
Edison International -- too sweet for just about everyone in the Legislature 
-- and immediately, efforts began to change it. 
Edison lobbyists worked the Legislature, and the utility cranked up a massive 
advertising and public relations campaign, to no apparent avail. And Davis, 
oddly, pulled back from the fray. The Democratic governor concentrated on 
another aspect of the crisis with greater political sex appeal: demanding 
that power generators, many of whom are PG&E and Edison creditors, be forced 
to repay many billions of dollars because, as he put it, they had gouged the 
state. Ultimately, Davis' campaign failed, although his strident advocacy 
did, apparently, arrest his decline in public opinion polls. Meanwhile, the 
Edison deal languished. With the Legislature now poised to leave Sacramento 
on a monthlong summer recess and a self-imposed deadline for enacting the 
Edison plan approaching, the Capitol is newly aflutter with efforts. 
"Complex" doesn't even begin to describe the situation. There are at least 
three alternative plans kicking around, none of which can be passed as 
written. Davis may be willing to accept almost anything that would save him 
from the embarrassment of another utility going to bankruptcy court on his 
watch, but currently backs a scheme ginned up by Assembly Democratic leaders. 
Edison, however, has split with Davis and now favors an alternative offered 
by Republicans and some moderate Democrats -- one that consumer advocates 
denounced as a corporate bailout. Meanwhile, liberal senators are pushing 
another version that Edison likes even less, but its critics among consumer 
activists like more. 
With both lawmakers and outside interest groups so widely scattered over 
what, if anything, should be done to rescue Edison, a consensus developed 
late Thursday to keep the vehicles alive with preliminary floor votes but 
continue private negotiations through the monthlong legislative recess. 
The many-sided stalemate stems from both the rival plans' provisions -- 
farmers, for example, fear environmentalists' gaining authority through the 
state over Edison-owned watershed in the Sierra -- and the convoluted 
dynamics of the Capitol. 
Legislative leadership is very weak in the era of term limits, especially in 
the Assembly, and lawmakers are leery about voting for any complex utility 
measure, particularly one that might raise rates. Some call it "1890 disease" 
for the number of the 1996 deregulation bill that backfired so badly. 
Then, too, some liberals and consumer activists appear to want all of the 
measures to fail, forcing Edison into bankruptcy court. Then, they believe, 
the newly created but still inactive state power authority could step in, 
using its $5 billion in untapped bonding authority, and pick up assets of the 
utilities on the cheap, thus creating a massive state utility system. 
Wheels within wheels, and none of them meshing.

California selling surplus power at fraction of cost it paid  


\
objattph 
By Karen Gaudette ASSOCIATED PRESS  July 19, 2001  SAN FRANCISCO ) California 
has begun selling power for a fraction of its purchase price as cool weather 
creates an abundance of electricity, spending that has been criticized by 
some watching the state's power crisis closely.  Power the state bought at an 
average of $138 per megawatt is being sold for as little as $1, energy 
traders say, though the price is disputed by state officials.  The state 
acknowleges the power sales, but says the surplus represented only a blip in 
an otherwise typical scorching summer and that blackouts still could roll if 
temperatures increase again. 

However, the surplus power selloff could encourage criticism that the state 
bought too much power at too high a price in its haste to fend off rolling 
blackouts and power prices 10 times higher than the year before.  "If the 
price is $138 on average for a month and you have to turn around and sell a 
chunk of it for a dollar, you're not going to look real good to a number of 
people," said Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading 
Forum in San Jose.  "I just don't think many people in California truly 
understood what their state did when they stepped into this business."  
Unlike natural gas, extra electricity cannot be stored away for a later day. 
Since Californians haven't been running their air conditioners as often as 
expected over the past week, the state hasn't needed the entire 38,000 
megawatts it had figured it would need.  The state Department of Water 
Resources, in charge of buying power for three financially ailing utilities, 
has spent the past few months arming the state with long-term energy 
contracts while weaning itself away from buying the highest-priced power on 
the last-minute electricity market.  Those contracts, along with last month's 
20 percent boost in energy conservation and the temperate weather, mean 
there's suddenly more power than Californians can use.  Energy traders say 
the state has tried to sell as much as 6,000 megawatts at one time, Ackerman 
said.  That's around 16 percent of the 38,000 megawatts the state estimated 
it would use around this time of year, Ackerman said. A megawatt is enough 
electricity to power roughly 750 homes.  "We know from traders who have 
bought that it's gone as low as a dollar and last week we know it was as low 
as $5," Ackerman said. "When a seller shows up with an enormous amount of 
power for sale and the market knows it, it has a depressing effect on 
prices."  California Energy Markets, a trade weekly, said the state sold 
power last Thursday at $25 per megawatt ) a price that Steve Maviglio, a 
spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis, said was "much closer to reality."  The state 
"never sold anything more than 1,000 megawatts on any single day," Maviglio 
said. "(Ackerman) has no evidence" of California selling power for $1, 
Maviglio said. "California Energy Markets is much closer to reality."  Oscar 
Hidalgo, a DWR spokesman, acknowledged the state has been trying to sell as 
much as 20 percent of its daily megawatts, though he would not say at what 
price. That could put the state at a disadvantage in the market if 
competitors knew how much it was paying, Hidalgo said.  "This is unusual, but 
it was anticipated, it is typical in the power buying operation," Hidalgo 
said.  "It's better than doing nothing with surplus power," Hidalgo said. 
"Scheduling energy is a balancing act because you can't store the item."  
Hidalgo said the state is sending some of the extra electricity up to the 
Bonneville Power Administration to repay it for power it had loaned 
California earlier this year.  "This is not a bad position for us to be in 
every once in a while," Hidalgo said. "If someone were to make these 
long-term contracts go away, we would fall off a cliff and be back where we 
were in January." 




PUC reveals plan to transfer much of watchdog role  


\
objattph 
By Craig D. Rose  UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER  July 19, 2001  The California 
Public Utilities Commission laid out a framework yesterday for transferring 
much of its watchdog role in ensuring fair electricity rates to the state 
Department of Water Resources.  The controversial proposal is in response to 
legislation earlier this year that puts the water department in charge of 
state power purchases. Utilities commission action is needed to ensure that 
the water department has enough revenue to make the purchases and to clarify 
areas of responsibility, including oversight of power rates.  Under the draft 
agreement made public yesterday, the commission would guarantee that 
consumers pay enough to cover interest payments on a planned $13.4 billion 
bond sale later this year. The guarantee is considered an essential element 
for completing the bond sale.  The bonds' proceeds are needed to repay some 
$8 billion the water department already has spent to purchase electricity and 
to cover future payments.  California began buying electricity through the 
water department earlier this year after the state's utilities were unable to 
make purchases because of credit problems brought on by the state's failed 
deregulation plan.  No mention was made in the draft agreement of the 
possibility of further rate increases to cover electricity purchases. Some 
observers have speculated that the current rate structure, even after two 
rounds of rate increases, may not cover all costs.  On the other hand, the 
draft agreement states that the water department itself will determine if the 
prices it pays for electricity meet the legal test of being just and 
reasonable, a determination heretofore made by the utilities commission.  
Under the utilities commission's procedure, the public is invited to comment 
on the draft. An administrative law judge for the commission will consider 
the draft before issuing a proposed decision. A full commission vote is 
expected Aug. 23, a deadline that would have to be met if the bond offering 
is to proceed as planned later this year.  Harvey Rosenfield, president of 
the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, said the utilities 
commission's draft agreement would allow a "secretive agency of dubious 
competence controlled by the governor and completely unaccountable to the 
public" to unilaterally order rate increases.  "It was deregulation which got 
us into the mess we are in today," Rosenfield said. "Now Wall Street is 
demanding that the (utilities commission) be forced to surrender its 
authority and legal responsibility."  He urged the commission to reject the 
draft proposal.  Carl Wood, one of five members of the Public Utilities 
Commission, said the draft agreement was driven largely by legislation 
empowering the water department as an electricity purchaser. With a state 
department buying power, Wood said, oversight shifts to the governor and the 
Legislature.  Commissioner Richard Bilas said he saw the agreement as 
empowering the water department as "prosecutor, judge and jury" in matters of 
electricity purchasing.  "The argument is that it's better off this way than 
the way we were," Bilas said. "And that's true in the short run. But what 
about in the long term?" 




Variety of plans to help Edison find friends, foes  


\
objattph 
Agreement in Legislature doesn't seem likely soon By Ed Mendel  UNION-TRIBUNE 
STAFF WRITER  July 19, 2001  SACRAMENTO -- Plans to aid Southern California 
Edison met mixed fates in legislative committees yesterday amid opposition 
from business, consumers and Edison itself, which said one of the plans would 
not restore its ability to borrow money.  The Senate energy committee 
rejected a plan that is tough on Edison, but the committee plans to consider 
it again today.  In the Assembly, a committee approved two plans. One has the 
support of Democratic leaders, is viewed more favorably by Gov. Gray Davis 
and has not drawn opposition from Edison. The other, crafted by the committee 
chairman, Rod Wright, D-Los Angeles, and Republicans, is supported by 
businesses and Edison.  Senate President Pro Tempore John Burton, D-San 
Francisco, told an Edison official during a committee hearing that financial 
experts have told him repeatedly that bankruptcy is the logical course for 
Edison.  "They keep saying they don't understand why a business in your 
situation does not avail themselves of that," Burton said.  The Senate leader 
told the Edison official not to expect the usual legislative compromises that 
would give the utility most of what it is seeking in a rescue plan.  "I want 
to disabuse you of the fact that somehow you are going to get some great big 
deal at the end of the rainbow," Burton said. "Because you are not going 
to."  The Senate and Assembly Democratic leadership plans require businesses 
to pay off most or all of Edison's debt, while also preventing businesses 
from shopping around for cheaper power. Business groups oppose the plans 
because of those provisions.  Davis is pushing for a legislative plan that 
would keep Edison from joining Pacific Gas and Electric in bankruptcy. He 
wants an Edison rescue plan that could become a model for getting PG&E out of 
bankruptcy.  Once their financial health is restored, the utilities could 
resume buying power for their customers, allowing the state to get out of the 
power-buying business it entered in January, when the utilities were crippled 
by a failed deregulation plan and no longer able to borrow money.  But the 
lengthy and sometimes emotional debates in legislative committees yesterday 
made it clear that reaching an agreement on an Edison rescue plan in the next 
few days will not be easy.  A plan that Davis negotiated with Edison in early 
April found little support in the Legislature and is not being considered. 
Opponents said the plan was too generous to Edison.  But the alternative 
rescue plans prepared in the Legislature also are called too generous to 
Edison by a consumer group, the Foundation for Consumer and Taxpayer Rights, 
which is threatening to put an initiative on the ballot to repeal any Edison 
"bailout."  Edison, on the other hand, fears that it will be saddled with too 
much debt and placed under a regulatory system that does not assure lenders 
that the utility will be able to pay costs for operating and buying equipment 
and power.  "We don't believe this bill in its present form would restore us 
to creditworthiness," Bob Foster, an Edison vice president, told a committee 
hearing the Senate plan.  The plan by Wright and Republicans was supported by 
business groups and Edison but opposed by consumers. All ratepayers would pay 
off the Edison debt and businesses would be allowed to shop for cheaper power 
as state long-term contracts expire.  "What will come out of the mix is hard 
to tell," said Steve Maviglio, Davis' press secretary. "Everyone is working 
feverishly to get something passed in the next few days." 






Baja is hoping energy squeeze can spark boom

New electricity, gas plants seen spurring a fresh wave of growth By Diane 
Lindquist  UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER  July 19, 2001  Energy shortages in 
California and Mexico are firing hopes for a new wave of industrial 
development in Baja California, where a maquiladora slowdown has cut 
thousands of jobs.  The power squeeze has triggered a rush to build 
electricity and natural gas projects in Baja California.  Once those plants 
are up and running, energy experts and Tijuana boosters say, the state will 
be able to make an unusual pitch to global manufacturers: Come to Baja 
California, where power is plentiful, reliable and relatively cheap.  "It's a 
new frontier for Baja California," said Institute of the Americas president 
Paul Boeker, a frontier that "opens up investment opportunities that aren't 
possible at the moment."  To seize the possibilities, Tijuana's Economic 
Development Corp. is pushing the Baja California government to fund a study 
to identify the United States' biggest electricity and natural gas users.  
"When we saw the price of energy going up so high in California, we thought 
we might be able to use this as a marketing tool," said David Mayagoitia, a 
director of the development group.  The hope is that an influx of big-energy 
users, such as high-tech firms that operate clean rooms, will offset serious 
problems in the region's sputtering maquiladora industry.  Since October, 
Baja California has lost 11,700 maquiladora jobs, 4 percent of the sector's 
total. In Tijuana alone, 7,600 positions have disappeared.  "I've never seen 
so many large and small and medium companies narrow their operations in such 
a short amount of time," said Deloitte & Touche accountant Mauricio Munroy.  
Maquiladora insiders like Munroy blame the U.S. economic downturn, rising 
costs, a strong peso and a new Mexican regulatory regime for reining in the 
operations.  Mayagoitia calls it a crisis.  "Our labor costs are going up. 
We're not as competitive as other places in the world. We have to look for 
other angles."  Over the past three decades, the arrival of foreign-owned 
maquiladoras has pushed Baja California's population to 2.5 million and 
transformed the state into one of the world's manufacturing hot spots. The 
region now ranks as a top producer of televisions and other consumer 
electronic products, and many other goods.  There are 1,287 factories in the 
state, employing 278,900 workers.  New operators continue to come. Since 
October, when employment began dropping, 33 companies have established 
factories in the state. Other companies, including Korean electronics giant 
Samsung, the state's largest operator, are expanding.  But in the past nine 
months, the sector's growth has dropped below its routine double-digit rate.  
Some companies, such as Sanyo and Day Runner, have shut factories. Others are 
threatening to. And so many have trimmed operations that Munroy said, "I 
don't think we can feel comfortable the industry's going to recover."  But 
now, California's energy crisis and cross-border power demands could alter 
that picture. A natural gas pipeline and three power plants in the works will 
boost the state's electricity output by 2,200 megawatts. As much as 1,500 
megawatts could flow to California consumers.  Additional plants are 
anticipated. Mexican Energy Secretary Ernesto Martens has said there's no 
limit to the number that could be built in Baja California. And California 
and Mexican officials are considering recruiting energy companies to start 
projects in Baja California.  Meanwhile, numerous companies -- El Paso and 
Phillips, Sempra, Chevron and Chiyoda among them -- have expressed interest 
in building liquid natural gas facilities near Rosarito and Ensenada. The 
operations would convert into vapor form liquified natural gas imported from 
other regions for use in Mexico and the United States.  Such projects could 
give Baja California billions of dollars in investment, thousands of 
construction and operating jobs, and a reputation as an energy-abundant place 
to do business.  "Large energy consumers could come down here, set up 
operations and get a big break on their utilities," Mayagoitia said.  
Previously, such operators have shunned Baja California.  "They've always 
said electricity down here is not constant. There are too many fluctuations 
on the line," Mayagoitia said.  While a bigger supply would overcome that 
obstacle, other challenges must be met before the region can use energy as a 
marketing tool.  At a San Diego Dialogue forum on energy last week, Boeker 
listed the key elements needed to attract the next wave of industrial 
development to Baja California. As he sees it, they need at least one liquid 
natural gas import facility, to allow power generators to export to 
California and sell directly to companies in Baja California, and to upgrade 
the cross-border gas and electricity transmission infrastructure.  Mexico 
also needs to make sure its business laws and regulations, which in the past 
have restricted the energy sector, allow corporations to get the supplies and 
prices they need to be competitive, Mayagoitia said.  "We think if the 
numbers make sense, and they have confidence that Mexico can deliver what 
they need, then we'll have the market niche."






GOP pushes energy bill with billions in tax breaks, emphasis on coal, oil, 
nuclear power  


\
objattph 
By H. Josef Hebert ASSOCIATED PRESS  July 19, 2001  WASHINGTON ) House 
Republican leaders hope to pass a broad energy package in the coming weeks 
that offers billions of dollars in tax breaks and favors for the coal, oil 
and nuclear industries as well as conservation incentives.  Much of the 
legislation, which emerged in bits and pieces this week from four House 
committees, mirrors ) and in some cases goes beyond ) the energy blueprint 
outlined by President Bush two months ago.  House GOP leaders have promised 
to enact energy legislation before Congress leaves for its summer recess in 
August.  The energy package includes drilling in an Arctic wildlife refuge, a 
top priority of the White House; incentives for technology to allow continued 
use of coal for power production; and tax breaks for high-mileage hybrid 
gas-electric automobiles.  But in some cases, the House committees have 
cleared measures not even sought by the administration.  Within one of the 
energy bills is a provision giving some of the largest, most profitable oil 
companies a waiver on having to pay the government royalties on oil and gas 
taken from new lease areas in the Gulf of Mexico. During the presidential 
campaign, Bush opposed such a royalty waiver, which critics claim amounts to 
a $7.3 billion windfall to the oil companies.  The House tax-writing 
committee, meanwhile, produced $33.5 billion worth of energy-related tax 
breaks ) a much broader sweep of tax incentives than Bush has sought ) even 
though some Democrats wondered whether there will be money available.  About 
half the tax breaks would go to oil, gas and coal industries and an 
additional $9 billion was earmarked to promote conservation and energy 
efficiency  Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., chairman of the Ways and Means 
Committee, said the aim was to produced "a balanced package of tax measures" 
that helps conservation and development of energy supplies.  But the breath 
of the tax incentives went far beyond those proposed by the White House 
energy task force headed by Vice President Dick Cheney.  In addition to tax 
breaks for clean coal initiatives, refineries, pipelines and nuclear power 
plants, the committee also approved tax credits on a wide range of 
conservation programs, from helping to sell hybrid-fueled cars to making it 
cheaper to insulate homes, buy residential solar panels, reduce energy use in 
commercial buildings and develop and sell more efficient appliances.  Still, 
"overall the (legislative) package is disappointing," said David Nemtzow, 
president of the Alliance to Save Energy, a private energy conservation 
advocacy group.  While Nemtzow praised the tax writers for some of their 
provisions, he said big-ticket energy saving items ) such as a major increase 
in automobile fuel economy and tougher appliance standards ) were largely 
rejected in other energy legislation advanced to the House floor this week.  
The disagreements over energy efficiency, a fight Democrats pledged to 
continue when the legislation is considered by the full House, was apparent 
during the Energy and Commerce Committee's crafting of its energy bill.  A 
proposal to boost the federal corporate average fuel economy standard, or 
CAFE, from the current 27.5 mpg to 37.5 mpg was soundly defeated, 43-11. 
Another fuel economy increase and an attempt to force the Bush administration 
to accept a more stringent federal air conditioner standard also fell by 
similar margins.  Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., the committee chairman, dismissed 
the criticism. He called the legislation that emerged from committee by a 
50-5 vote a "landmark conservation bill" that for the first time in years has 
Congress taking steps to increase motor vehicle fuel economy.  The bill 
requires that CAFE standards for light trucks be adjusted to reduce gasoline 
consumption by new sport utility vehicles and minivans by 5 billion gallons 
over six years. Critics called that far too little, noting that the gasoline 
savings over six years would amount to about what all cars and trucks consume 
in two weeks.  The Bush administration's biggest victory came in the 
Resources Committee, where Democrats failed 19-29 to strip the legislation of 
a provision that would allow oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife 
Refuge in northeastern Alaska.  Opponents vowed to kill the provision on the 
House floor, where Democrats will be joined by many moderate Republicans in 
opposing it. Senate Democrats also have said no Arctic refuge drilling 
measure would pass.  Nevertheless, Rep. James Hansen, R-Utah, sponsor of the 
legislation, said he was optimistic. "It's a selling job," he said, noting 
that with the various energy bills before the full House, "we're now down to 
serious business." 








Edison May Avert Bankruptcy Filing
Energy: Thanks to a rate increase and natural gas price drop, the utility's 
improved cash flow may cover its electricity costs.
By JERRY HIRSCH
Times Staff Writer

July 20 2001

For the first time in months, Southern California Edison is collecting more 
money than it is spending on electricity, a shift that could enable the 
utility to avoid bankruptcy without a state intervention as dramatic as the 
proposed $2.8-billion purchase of the company's transmission lines.

The turnabout has come during the last several weeks as natural gas prices--a 
major component in the cost of electricity--have plummeted and as Edison has 
collected more money from customers through a record increase in rates 
approved by state regulators.

The utility this month expects to collect more than it will spend on 
electricity--the first time that has happened since the state's power crunch 
started in May 2000. If the trend holds, Edison would be able to cover 
several hundred million dollars in losses that piled up after Feb. 1 from its 
purchases of electricity, said executives at the Rosemead-based company.

Edison's relief comes against a backdrop in which the California power crisis 
appears to be easing, as consumers conserve energy, new power plants come 
online and wholesale prices moderate from the high levels of last winter.

The executives said that barring an unusually severe heat wave, which would 
prompt customers to crank up energy-guzzling air conditioners, or another 
spike in natural gas prices, Edison by early next year also could make 
payments on a proposed bond offering to pay down its $3.5 billion in debt 
from energy purchases before Feb. 1.

Creditors of the utility and consultants working with the governor's office 
agree that such a scenario could mean that Edison would be able to stay out 
of U.S. Bankruptcy Court without the state buying the company's transmission 
lines, which is a key element in Gov. Gray Davis' now-stalled proposal to 
rescue the utility.

Jim Scilacci, the utility's chief financial officer, has hinted at improving 
company finances during conference calls with creditors holding $931 million 
in defaulted bonds and notes in recent weeks. Investors have responded 
positively, boosting the company's depressed stock price about 45% in the 
last six weeks to a Thursday close of $14.70 on the New York Stock Exchange.

Although Edison's cash flow may be enough to cover its electricity costs, its 
huge debts keep it far from solvency. Moreover, the company still faces two 
wild cards in its fight to avoid bankruptcy: California's own claims on that 
cash and the utility's uncertain prospects of gaining state approval to use 
the money to repay its debts.

The Department of Water Resources is buying electricity for 27 million 
Californians served by Edison and the state's two other regulated utilities. 
The agency could disclose as soon as today how big a slice it will take from 
Edison's rate collections to repay a proposed $13.4-billion bond offering to 
cover the state's purchases.

The water agency began buying electricity from private generators in January, 
after Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric Co., the Northern California utility, 
became mired in debt. PG&E went on to file for bankruptcy protection in April.

"What this means for Edison all depends on how much money it can keep," said 
Paul Patterson, an analyst with investment bank ABN Amro in New York.

The water department's requirements could eat up much of the margin that has 
provided Edison with its small cushion this month. However, Joseph Fichera, 
chief executive of Saber Partners, which is advising the governor, said the 
latest numbers indicate that there is enough money in current rates to 
implement the governor's plan to pay for the utility's debt as well as the 
state's current and future power purchases.

Even if the water department allocation still left room for Edison to pay off 
its debts, such a course of action would require approval by the state 
Legislature and the Public Utilities Commission. Although energy trends 
appear to allow the utility to regain its financial footing, analysts 
cautioned that the utility still could find itself in Bankruptcy Court if the 
state doesn't provide a method for Edison to pay its debts.

"While we might be able to cover our costs going forward, it is equally 
important that we have a way to pay off that $3.5-billion debt," said Brian 
Bennett, an Edison vice president. "But without knowing what [the water 
department's] revenue needs are, we won't know what is left over in rates to 
cover our costs."

Bennett blamed the utility's so-called under-collection--debts that piled up 
as frozen consumer rates could not cover soaring wholesale electricity 
costs--on what he called "flawed regulatory policies."

Based on recent energy prices, Bennett said, "We are just only beginning to 
repay the under-collection."

The recently enacted rate increases, which kicked in last month, have pushed 
what Edison can charge customers for the electricity component of their bills 
from about 7 cents a kilowatt-hour to 10.27 cents.

At the same time, declining natural gas prices have sliced in half what the 
utility must pay to a group of small and alternative-energy companies that 
generate about 27% of its electricity needs. Edison, for example, paid this 
group 18.6 cents a kilowatt-hour in February. That dropped to 13.6 cents by 
May and now stands at about 7.5 cents. Each penny decline in the cost of 
electricity from this group of generators represents more than $200 million 
in savings for Edison on an annual basis.

Bennett cautioned that if the water department requires additional funds or 
if Edison's energy costs were to turn upward again, "then rates once again 
may not be adequate to cover our generation costs. It is therefore imperative 
that this uncertainty in the rate structure be cured now so we establish 
predictable, stable rates for our customers."

Three plans to aid Edison to varying degrees are working their way through 
the Legislature, though late Thursday it appeared none would be approved 
before lawmakers adjourn for a summer recess. Several legislators have said 
they are content to let Edison join PG&E in bankruptcy.

Any plan that would allow Edison to use a portion of the rates it is 
collecting to pay off a bond offering would meet the objection of some 
consumer groups, which label the concept a corporate bailout.

"Just as the utilities gambled on deregulation and were winners at first, 
Edison now has to be responsible for its losses," said Harvey Rosenfield, 
president of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica. 
He said Bankruptcy Court is the most appropriate place for Edison to resolve 
its financial problems.

Several creditors of the utility, however, said that as long as Edison can 
tread water or even work down its debts, there is little incentive to put the 
company into bankruptcy, which would only add another legal layer and more 
expenses to an exceptionally complicated situation.

Creditors could move against the company if they believed its finances were 
declining and thus shrinking the amount of cash and assets that could be 
distributed in a bankruptcy proceeding. They also could put Edison into 
involuntary bankruptcy if some creditors exacted payment from the company 
ahead of others that are owed money.

Summer blackout seers missing the mark -- so far 
Blackout visions only bad dreams 
WHAT OUTAGES? State efforts paying off 
Joe Garofoli, Chronicle Staff Writer <mailto:jgarofoli@sfchronicle.com>

Months ago, the experts said there might be a blackout today. 
If not today, then probably this week. 
Well, most likely this month. 
If not, then for sure sometime this summer, so Californians had better unplug 
the toaster and pray for rain because there are going to be 260 hours of 
blackouts this summer. Or more. 
It's starting to feel like the day after Y2K around here. 
An unexpected thing happened on the way to California's summer of darkness - 
- nothing. Zero blackouts this summer, thanks to Gray-friendly skies and 
Californians conserving power in record amounts. 
Now the state is so flush with power that it's selling back the surplus at a 
loss. Even Disneyland has cranked up its flashy Electrical Parade again. 
Still, the doomsayers aren't backpedaling, merely clarifying their fevered 
springtime predictions. Like Michael Zenker, of Cambridge Research 
Associates. 
"I think (the reporter) was asking me to speculate," Zenker said of his 
comment in May that there could be hundreds of hours of darkness this summer. 
Officially, he said, his organization predicted 20 to 40 hours of blackouts. 
And it doesn't plan to adjust that figure. "We've decided not to do any live 
forecasting," Zenker said. 
Who knew what the summer would bring? Not California's power officials. The 
state's Department of Water Resources was in such a blackout-fearing frenzy 
earlier this year that it purchased too much power. So, over the past few 
days, 
the state has been forced to sell power it bought for as much $133 per 
megawatt for between $15 and $30, department spokesman Oscar Hidalgo said 
yesterday. 
"If you would have told us last winter that there would be a week in July 
that there would be a surplus of power, a lot of people would have had smiles 
on their faces," Hidalgo said. 
That isn't the only fallout from the summer of surprising light. A group of 
California business and development leaders worries that the rest of the 
country is asking the same misinformed question as your Aunt Minnie in 
Cleveland: "How do all you people in California work by candlelight all the 
time?" 
That kind of ignorance cost a Hewlett-Packard manufacturing plant in 
Roseville some business two months ago. A longtime Midwestern customer was so 
afraid that his company's order wouldn't be filled on time because of 
blackouts that he sent his business to an HP plant in California's energy 
nemesis: Texas. 
"If that company thought that way, then how many others back East are 
thinking that way?" said Ken Larson, a spokesman for Hewlett-Packard. He is 
helping a $150,000, six-month promotional campaign called the Power of 
California, which will send economic and business leaders across the country 
to counter the misrepresentation that blackouts are a part of daily life in 
the Golden State. The campaign is being funded mostly with private money. 
Looking back, there was no shortage of blackout Henny Pennys last spring. 
The North American Electrical Reliability Council predicted 260 hours of 
darkness. The Bay Area Economic Council said there would be a blackout every 
business day this summer. 
Neither organization regrets yelling "Blackout!" in a crowded state. 
"At the time (March), there was good reason to expect that things would be 
that bad," said Sean Randolph, president of the Bay Area Economic Forum, a 
group of public and private leaders. 
"Without that elevation of public consciousness, we wouldn't have gotten the 
demand change (conservation) that we expected." 
Others resorted to two favorite scapegoats: the weather and the media. 
"The headlines on blackouts were around last summer," said Ellen Vancko, a 
spokeswoman for the North American Electrical Reliability Council in New 
Jersey. "You should check out your own paper." 
Besides, Vancko said, nobody could have predicted that temperatures would 
remain at or below average in California's major cities. 
Actually, temperatures were 1.3 degrees above normal at San Francisco 
International Airport in June and 3 degrees above normal in most Central 
Valley cities. And yet, no blackouts. 
Nearly every forecaster cautions that summer is only half over and the 
hottest part of the season lies ahead. 
"Conservation is still important," said Stephanie McCorkle, a spokeswoman for 
the California Independent System Operator, which runs the state's power 
grid. She offered a prediction on when Californians could relax about the 
threat of blackouts. 
"At the first frost," she said. "November, maybe?"

State advisers forced to sell energy stocks 
CONFLICT: Holdings called unethical 
Mark Martin, Chronicle Staff Writer <mailto:mmartin@sfchronicle.com>

Sacramento -- One consultant hired by the state to negotiate long-term 
electricity contracts owned stock in a company that signed billion-dollar 
deals with California. 
Another fresh hire bought more than $10,000 in stock in Enron Corp. -- the 
Houston power trader frequently vilified by Gov. Gray Davis and lawmakers -- 
as he helped the state develop electricity buying strategy. 
A top Davis lawyer told the two consultants and seven others on Wednesday 
morning to sell off stock in companies like Enron and Calpine Corp. within 
four hours or lose their jobs. 
Having a financial interest in electric companies while working for the state 
on power issues was not ethical, said Barry Goode, Davis' legal affairs 
secretary, in a memo. 
All nine complied with the directive, said Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio 
said, but controversy intensified yesterday over whether some of the state's 
hired guns managing the energy crisis have conflicts of interest. 
The stock investments have come to light in the past week as 35 consultants 
hired by the state to buy and schedule power and to negotiate energy 
contracts have submitted documents detailing their personal finances. 
Most of the consultants who owned stock list their jobs as schedulers -- 
those who schedule electricity deliveries after power has been purchased. 
But others more directly involved with power trading also owned stock in 
energy companies, documents show. 
Richard Ferreira earns $200 an hour to help negotiate and manage the state's 
long-term contracts with power companies. He started his job Jan. 31. 
According to Ferreira's financial statement, he owned between $2,000 and 
$10,000 worth of stock in Calpine Corp. -- the company based in San Jose that 
announced on Feb. 28 it had signed two long-term contracts with the state 
worth $8.3 billion. 
Ferreira could not be reached for comment, and spokesmen for the Department 
of Water Resources, which hired the consultants, said he did not know if 
Ferreira worked on the Calpine contracts. 
Another consultant, Richard Nichols, bought between $10,000 and $100,000 
worth of stock in Enron in April -- more than three months after his company 
signed on with the state to help "in the procurement of power supplies," 
according to his job description. The stock buy came at a time when the 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission was taking a hard line against wholesale 
electricity price caps for California. 
Nichols' company, Navigant Consulting, Inc., could make as much as $800,000 
for its work for the state this year. Nichols could not be reached for 
comment. 
Citing invoices from Controller Kathleen Connell's office, Secretary of State 
Bill Jones, an announced GOP candidate for governor, argued that there are at 
least seven other Navigant employees who are billing the state for work on 
energy issues. None of them have disclosed their financial interests. 
Jones said he takes issue with the Davis administration's decisions on who 
should file financial statements and who should be exempt. 
FINANCES NOT DISCLOSED
Several consultants, including two Wall Street firms that made $275,000 a 
month to negotiate the state's attempts to bail out troubled public 
utilities, have not disclosed their finances because Davis officials have 
concluded they do not fit the definition of a consultant. 
Jones has suggested that the state's long-term deals with several companies 
to deliver electricity might be invalid if negotiators had a financial stake 
in those companies. 
Maviglio said Davis officials were investigating whether there had been any 
direct conflicts. The state attorney general's office and the state's Fair 
Political Practices Commission also are reviewing Jones' allegations. 
Maviglio and a spokesman for the state's Department of Water and Power could 
not say yesterday whether new employees were asked before they were hired 
whether they had any financial stake in the energy market. 
STOCKS SOLD VOLUNTARILY
But some consultants acknowledged a potential conflict and got rid of stocks 
before this week. In his filing, Mark Skowdronski reports owning more than 
$10,000 worth of Reliant Energy stocks when he began his job in March of 
negotiating long-term contracts for the state. When he was given the task of 
negotiating with Reliant, he said he sold his stock on March 20. 
Jones has stopped short of accusing anyone of criminal activity. And a letter 
from Attorney General Bill Lockyer to Jones notes that the consultants would 
have to own more than 3 percent of a company they dealt with to be prosecuted 
criminally. 
Maviglio said the accusations come from a man who is launching his run for 
Davis' job next year. 
"This is all politics," said Steve Maviglio, Davis' press secretary. "We're 
following the law." 
He said that when the state was forced to enter the business of buying power 
earlier this year, officials had to quickly hire people who knew the energy 
business, including some who still had investments in power companies. 
"If you want a plumber, you hire a guy who has plumbing experience," Maviglio 
said.

Democrats defy Davis with bill on PUC 
Utilities panel would keep power over rates

MN222719.DTL>
Sacramento -- Lawmakers moved with lightning speed yesterday to undo a plan 
that would force California regulators to raise electricity rates whenever 
state power buyers deem it necessary. 
A hastily introduced bill pits Democratic lawmakers against the 
administration of Gov. Gray Davis, which is counting on the state Public 
Utilities Commission to approve rate increases to pay for electricity without 
questioning whether the state got a good price. 
Historically, utilities bought their electricity and asked the PUC to approve 
rate hikes. The PUC decided whether the requests were justified. 
But with the utilities now deeply in debt and the state buying electricity, 
the old system has broken down. This week, the PUC issued a draft agreement 
that would guarantee the state would get as much money as it needs to pay for 
the electricity it is buying. 
Consumer advocates said the proposed agreement would force the PUC to cede 
its responsibility to protect customers from unreasonable rate increases. 
Senate leader John Burton, D-San Francisco, called the agreement 
"overreaching" by the governor's Department of Water Resources, which is 
buying the state's power. 
Under Burton's bill, consumers would still have to repay $13.4 billion in 
bonds that the state plans to float to cover its purchases. But the bill 
would allow the PUC to scrutinize the state's expenses beyond those covered 
by the bond -- costs mounting to billions of dollars over the next 15 to 20 
years. 
The bill passed out of two committees with bipartisan support yesterday and 
now faces a vote by the full Senate. Both business and consumer groups 
expressed their support for the measure. 
"This is better for ratepayers," said Lenny Goldberg of the Utility Reform 
Network. "It makes the bond issue secure and gives a chance to look into all 
of the contracts." 
PUC Commissioner Richard Bilas said some change is needed to restore 
commission oversight. 
"The only check and balance on the Department of Water Resources as it is 
would be the governor," Bilas said. "I think it takes a different branch of 
government to do that oversight." 
But Bruce Van Dusen, a lawyer hired by the Department of Water Resources, 
said Burton's bill could delay the bond sale and jeopardize the general fund. 
The concern is that while Burton's bill guarantees that the bond issue would 
be repaid, it does not spell out how all the long-term electricity contracts 
that the state has signed will be covered. The contracts stipulate that the 
generators will be paid through electricity rates.

(07-20) 07:23 PDT (AP) -- 
Developments in California's energy crisis: 
FRIDAY:
* No power alerts Friday as electricity reserves stay above 7 percent. 
THURSDAY:
* Legislators continue struggling with competing versions of a plan crafted 
by Gov. Gray Davis to rescue Southern California Edison from bankruptcy. 
Davis' plan, announced in April, offers Edison $2.76 billion for its 
transmission system and lets the utility issue revenue bonds to repay the 
rest of their debts. Edison is estimated to have amassed $3.5 billion in 
debts from record-high wholesale electricity prices to customers. A competing 
bill by Speaker Robert Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys, and Assemblyman Fred Keeley, 
D-Boulder Creek, would trims at least $300 million from the governor's offer, 
and also would allow Edison to issue the bonds, which would be repaid by 
Edison ratepayers over a decade. 
* Pacific Gas and Electric Co. decides to extend contracts to buy electricity 
from 131 small power plants for the next five years, the utility announced 
Thursday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court. As part of the deal, the utility also will 
pay those power plants $740 million for unpaid electricity deliveries they 
had made to PG&E before it filed for federal bankruptcy protection on April 
6. The power plants throughout the state, which largely harness energy from 
the sun, wind, biomass and natural gas to produce electricity in 
environmentally friendly ways, agreed to supply PG&E with nearly 3,000 
megawatts of power for 5.37 cents per kilowatt hour on average. 
* Assemblyman John Campbell sends a letter to the director of the Department 
of Water Resources, demanding to know how much surplus power the state is 
selling and at what price. Since January, the state has bought electricity 
for the customers of three financially ailing utilities. Cooler July 
temperatures than expected have led to a sudden surplus of power, which 
energy traders say is being sold for more than $100 less than it was bought. 
State officials say the extra power shows the state planned ahead well, and 
that if the weather heats up, it will be prepared. 
* In sharp contrast to a poll released in May, Californians now say that 
although the state needs power, nuclear energy is not a safe enough source. 
The poll, released Thursday by the Public Policy Institute of California, 
showed that 55 percent of residents believe nuclear power is too dangerous, 
even if building more nuclear power plants would help alleviate the country's 
energy problems. In a Field Institute poll of 1,015 adults released in May, 
59 percent of Californians favored nuclear power and 36 percent were opposed. 
* PG&E Corp. shares rise 30 cents to close at $15.40. Shares of Edison 
International rise 25 cents to close at $14.70. Sempra shares rise 65 cents 
to close at $27.12. 
* No power alerts Thursday as electricity reserves stay above 7 percent. 
* The Senate and Assembly are expected to vote on competing versions of deals 
to rescue Southern California Edison from bankruptcy. Legislators are trying 
to clear their agendas before leaving for a monthlong summer break. 
WHAT'S NEXT:
* The Department of Water Resources, the state agency that since January has 
been buying electricity for the customers of three financially ailing 
utilities, is set to release on Friday numbers that will indicate whether 
state power regulators will need to order an electric rate increase so the 
state can recoup its power buying and administrative costs. 
THE PROBLEM:
High demand, high wholesale energy costs, transmission glitches and a tight 
supply worsened by scarce hydroelectric power in the Northwest and 
maintenance at aging California power plants are all factors in California's 
electricity crisis. 
Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric say they've lost 
nearly $14 billion since June 2000 to high wholesale prices the state's 
electricity deregulation law bars them from passing on to consumers. PG&E, 
saying it hasn't received the help it needs from regulators or state 
lawmakers, filed for federal bankruptcy protection April 6. Electricity and 
natural gas suppliers, scared off by the companies' poor credit ratings, are 
refusing to sell to them, leading the state in January to start buying power 
for the utilities' nearly 9 million residential and business customers. The 
state is also buying power for a third investor-owned utility, San Diego Gas 
& Electric, which is in better financial shape than much larger Edison and 
PG&E but is also struggling with high wholesale power costs. 
The Public Utilities Commission has approved average rate increases of 37 
percent for the heaviest residential customers and 38 percent for commercial 
customers, and hikes of up to 49 percent for industrial customers and 15 
percent or 20 percent for agricultural customers to help finance the state's 
multibillion-dollar power buys. 







Energy Secretary to speak at forum on California energy crisis

(07-20) 00:28 PDT SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- 
U.S. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham spent only a few minutes addressing 
California's power woes as he spoke to an audience of business leaders and 
city representatives who have seen blackouts roll through their factories and 
technology firms. 
California's power woes will not be solved with conservation and increased 
reliance on renewable energy alone, Abraham told the crowd of local business 
leaders in echoing statements from other Bush administration officials. 
"If you don't have enough energy supply you face the threat of blackouts," 
Abraham said. He devoted the rest of his speech promoting key aspects of the 
Bush administrations energy plan. 
The nation needs to expand and improve its electricity transmission system to 
make sure power can get where it needs to go, unimpaired by political and 
geographical borders, Abraham said. 
"It's not just enough to just have an adequate supply. It has to be 
reliable," Abraham told the crowd. 
Abraham urged the technology industry to focus on developing methods to move 
power more efficiently, and added that charging more for power at certain 
times of day would trigger more conservation than the government urging the 
public to cut back usage. 
He praised the efforts of Washington State-based Puget Sound Energy to bill 
its ratepayers more if they used electricity during times of highest demand 
-- when electricity is most expensive -- to encourage them to conserve or 
shift their factory production or laundry to cheaper hours of the day. 
Rather than relying solely on distant power plants for electricity, Abraham 
hopes homes and businesses will soon run their appliances on power they might 
produce in their own backyards and parking lots. 
Abraham arrived in San Francisco after telling a crowd of Hispanic community 
advocates in Milwaukee that the Bush administration saw partnerships with 
neighboring countries, including Mexico, as essential to developing untapped 
energy sources. 
Abraham's speeches around the country coincide with a House Republican effort 
to approve broad-ranging energy legislation before the end of the month when 
Congress leaves for its summer recess. 
The GOP's energy package would offer billions of dollars in tax breaks and 
favors for the coal, oil and nuclear industries as well as conservation 
incentives. That plan is similar and in some cases exceeds the energy 
blueprint outlined by President Bush two months ago. 
The package of legislation includes drilling in an Arctic wildlife refuge; 
incentives for technology to allow continued use of coal for power 
production; and tax breaks for high-mileage hybrid gas-electric automobiles. 
It exceeds the Bush plan in a provision that gives some of the largest, most 
profitable oil companies a waiver on having to pay the government royalties 
on oil and gas taken from new lease areas in the Gulf of Mexico. Bush opposed 
the royalty waiver, which critics claim amounts to a $7.3 million windfall to 
the oil companies. 
Vice President Dick Cheney is also visiting cities around the country 
promoting the Bush energy plan, fearing it is losing steam as gas prices and 
other energy costs continue to slide. 
Both the Bush plan and the House's energy package have been criticized by 
environmental groups as being too soft on expanding energy efficiency and 
conservation programs and too easy on extending tax breaks to energy 
companies. 
Some of the criticisms stem from Cheney's refusal to identify all the 
industry leaders who met with the energy task forced chaired by the vice 
president which developed the Bush energy policy.

Energy secretary in S.F. to push Bush program 
Abraham says supply is the key, not conservation

In San Francisco to stump for President Bush's energy plans, Energy Secretary 
Spencer Abraham yesterday praised California's conservation efforts but 
insisted that frugality alone would not solve the power crisis. 
Abraham, speaking to a group of Bay Area business leaders, warned against the 
perception that the crisis is lessening even though rolling blackouts haven't 
materialized this summer as expected. 
"There's a pervasive myth," he told people at the Bay Area Council's annual 
dinner at the San Francisco Hilton on O'Farrell Street. "It's the idea that 
we have no real energy crisis, or if we do, it can be overcome with 
conservation." 
He insisted that California and the rest of the country still need to 
increase power production, decrease dependence on foreign oil and fix an 
inadequate electricity transmission system -- key elements of the 
administration's plan. 
"We've not only got to have more supply, it has to be reliable," he said. 
Abraham also delivered a pitch aimed straight at some of the technology 
companies with representatives at the dinner, saying the government needed 
their help to create a radically different power system in decades to come. 
He described a future in which superconductors would make energy transmission 
more efficient, with electricity flowing easily across the country through a 
"transmission superhighway." 
The United States would join Canada and Mexico in hemispheric power planning, 
and consumers would have their own home generators and sell power back to the 
grid. He also suggested that environmentally friendly hydrogen fuel devices 
could one day replace much of the need for gas and oil. 
"I challenge high-tech to embrace this agenda, to fight for this agenda, and 
apply your genius to it," Abraham said. 
His address came as the federal government's latest broad energy bill -- 
including new fuel economy requirements for sport utility vehicles and 
subsidies for clean coal technology -- was sent to the House of 
Representatives floor. Although the proposal received substantial bipartisan 
support in the House Energy and Commerce Committee, many Democrats have 
argued that it does not do enough to promote conservation.

THEY SAY nothing is fair in love and war. It isn't. But nor is it fair when 
it comes to energy. 
In Washington, Vice President Dick Cheney, champion of the drill-and-burn 
industry, asks the Navy to foot the electric bills for his mansion. 
At the same time, the vice president refuses to disclose the costs incurred 
by his energy task force or to reveal the hot shots from the oil and gas 
industry who helped shape its final policies. 
Closer to home, California residents brace for the aftershocks of the energy 
crisis. With the state now locked into secret, long-term and costly energy 
contracts, it is the public -- not the energy suppliers who made out like 
bandits -- who will be burdened by the billions spent purchasing electricity. 
At present, only 39 percent of those surveyed approve of the way Gov. Gray 
Davis has handled this crisis. Approval may drop even lower when California 
residents absorb the astonishing news that we suddenly enjoy an energy 
surplus and that our state is now selling it on a glutted market. 
Add to the disgruntled those folks who were already in the habit of shutting 
off lights and lowering their thermostats. For them, the mail brought no 20 
percent rebate on their electricity bill. It is the watt hogs, who never 
lowered the air conditioner and left lights burning all over their homes, 
whose paltry efforts netted them the governor's award. 
Give the governor credit for keeping the lights on in California. But his 
less-than- bold decisions will result in serious political and economic 
consequences. Soon, we will have to confront the grave reality that we have 
mortgaged many of our dreams ( for expanded health care, improved education 
and support for the mentally ill ( for a future burdened by crushing debt.

Wilson says Davis ignored warnings about energy 
Former governor defends himself

Former Gov. Pete Wilson, who signed the controversial 1996 energy 
deregulation bill into law, blasted his successor Gray Davis yesterday for 
failing to aggressively use the governor's most forceful tool -- emergency 
powers -- to contain the state's energy crisis. 
"There are people who have ignored the supply and tried to blame the crisis 
on everyone else," the Republican former governor told nearly 100 academics 
and reporters at the Public Policy Institute in San Francisco yesterday. 
Arguing that Davis ignored early warnings about brewing problems and "put in 
jeopardy parks, schools and other capital needs," Wilson said the Democratic 
governor has skillfully engaged in finger-pointing and public relations to 
blur perception of the current energy troubles. 
"They've sought to blame me, and have done so with some success. . . . And 
they've found a much more profitable and exciting target, President Bush," 
said Wilson, who wryly pronounced Bush's recent trip to California as "a 
triumph -- for Davis." 
But Davis' strategy, he said, "doesn't create one watt of new power." 
Wilson's speech -- his toughest public remarks to date on the energy crisis 
-- came the day the Public Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, 
released polls showing Californians now believe energy ranks far and away as 
the state's most pressing problem. Many of those voters blame Wilson, not 
Davis, for the power shortages and rolling blackouts, the poll shows. 
The former governor's sharp words were rejected by Davis' senior political 
adviser, Garry South, who said Wilson is trying to "revise history." 
"If there is one shred of evidence that Pete Wilson said one thing or raised 
one red flag about energy supply, let him produce it," South said yesterday. 
"Pete Wilson accusing Gov. Davis of being responsible (for energy) is like 
Herbert Hoover blaming FDR for the Depression. We're trying to clean up his 
mess." 
The GOP former two-term governor spoke on the issue of California energy as 
members of the Bush administration fanned out across the nation, including a 
California trip by Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, to push the White 
House's energy policy. 
But even the president appeared to point the finger at Wilson for some of 
California's problems. "They hadn't built a power plant in 12 years" in 
California, Bush told reporters Wednesday. "And guess what? When you grow 
your state the way they have . . . it creates problems." 
Such words chafe Wilson, who produced California Energy Commission figures 
that, he said, showed that small plants were built during his administration. 
In fact, he argued, the 1996 deregulation bill encouraged energy producers to 
seek state approval for new plants. 
While acknowledging the 1996 bill he signed was "flawed," Wilson said, "I 
thought the flaws would be addressed." 
"We knew it was not a perfect free market mechanism," said Wilson, adding 
that he had strong reservations about the utility rate caps included in the 
legislation. "(That) was a gamble, but it was one that paid off for while." 
But, he insisted, the bill -- which critics say kicked off California's 
energy woes -- had benefits for the state. 
Wilson said it was believed deregulation would spur private industry to build 
new plants that would fuel industry and "lots of jobs for Californians." 
Deregulation was also seen as a means to balance power companies' concerns 
about a lengthy, "nightmarish" process -- which he said dated to the early 
1970s -- to build large power plants. 
Davis "is now posing in front of those plants" opening because of decisions 
made before he took office, Wilson noted. "I hope that he's pleased with our 
handiwork." 
Wilson, also lambasted Davis for failing to heed 1998 warnings from the 
California Energy Commission about coming blackouts. 
And, Wilson said, as the state faced rolling blackouts, job losses, and 
skyrocketing energy costs, Davis failed to use one of his greatest tools in a 
crisis: emergency powers. 
Wilson noted that after the 1994 Northridge earthquake, estimates suggested 
it would take 2 1/2 years to rebuild downed freeways and overpasses. He used 
his emergency powers to offer incentives to contractors that rebuilt the 
bridges within 65 days. 
South, noting that Davis has used his emergency powers to deal with the 
energy crisis, said there is no comparison between an earthquake and a full- 
blown statewide energy crisis.

California buzzing with power - but for how long? 
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Gray skies, chill fog, unseasonable rain, and 
moderate temperatures might not make for a perfect California summer -- but 
this year, it is exactly what the sun-loving state was praying for. 
With power supplies critically short and forecasts of summer blackouts 
swirling, California headed into the hot months geared up for repeated power 
outages that threatened to throw the West Coast into chaos. 
But a state that prides itself in defying prediction has done it again, 
sailing through the first weeks of summer with so much power it is selling 
its excess on the open market. 
``Various forecasters have predicted various horror stories, and we have got 
through the summer so far without blackouts,'' said Steve Maviglio, spokesman 
for Gov. Gray Davis -- who has staked his career on beating the blackouts. 
``But the situation is unpredictable, and the weather is the most 
unpredictable thing of all.'' 
No one is saying California's energy crisis is over. The state is still 
struggling to control the wreckage of its power deregulation scheme, a 1996 
policy which was supposed to bring lower power prices and more consumer 
choice. Instead it sparked spiraling wholesale power costs, a major utility 
bankruptcy, critical power shortages, and six days of blackouts between 
January and May. 
The last outages swept the state May 8, unplugging tens of thousands of 
customers in what industry experts warned was the first of as many as 260 
hours of summer blackouts. 
The absence of new blackouts has been attributed to consumer conservation 
among the state's 34 million residents, improved power supplies, increased 
federal price controls and above all, the unexpected blessing of a dreary 
summer. 
``Mother Nature has been very, very kind to us,'' said Severin Borenstein, 
director of the University of California Energy Institute. 
While temperatures have been several degrees lower than normal over the past 
few days throughout California, meteorologists say the summer so far has 
actually been marginally warmer than most. 
But the state has so far escaped the governor's worst nightmare -- a searing 
stretch of extremely hot days that sends people running to their air 
conditioners. 
``Temperatures have been nominally above normal, but you haven't had a lot of 
extremely hot days. If it's only moderately warm, the state can deal with 
it,'' said Ed O'Lenic of the National Weather Service's Climate Prediction 
Center. ''The cloudiness and the precipitation has probably helped.'' 
The cooperative weather has been matched by Californians' own conservation 
efforts. Electricity use, adjusted for economic and population growth and 
weather, has been falling steadily every month this year, culminating in a 
12.3 percent savings in June compared with the year-ago level. 
Conservation during the critical peak demand hours, when the threat of 
blackouts is greatest, cut use an even more significant 14.1 percent -- a 
saving of some 5,570 megawatts, or the equivalent of five big nuclear power 
plants. 
The energy picture -- further improved by three new power plants -- has 
boosted supplies to such a degree that California recently found itself 
selling extra power on the open market. 
Locked in to long-term purchasing contracts and unable to store the 
electricity, California has dumped excess power for prices far lower than it 
paid, leaving consumer groups fuming. 
Officials dismiss the complaints as absurd, noting the amount of power 
involved is ``inconsequential'' and stressing the entire state's power supply 
could tip back into crisis within 24 hours of the start of a heat wave. 
``After being blasted for blackouts, I am very happy to be criticized for 
having a tiny bit too much,'' said David Freeman, Davis' chief energy 
adviser. 
The question now is whether California will be able to keep up its energy 
balancing act for the rest of the summer. 
The North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC), an industry group 
which projected the 260 hours of blackouts this summer, has conceded those 
forecasts might have been high. But it points to continued problems dogging 
California's energy system including transmission bottlenecks, and inadequate 
power generation. 
Officials and industry analysts say the biggest danger the state faces is a 
sudden change in the weather, followed closely by a relaxation of consumer 
conservation efforts. 
Those worries are increased by the fact that August and September are 
historically the hottest months across the most heavily-populated areas of 
California, where late autumn heat waves are not uncommon. 
``When we get the three-day, West-wide heat wave we are in deep trouble, and 
it is very likely we will get that sort of a heat wave at some point,'' 
Borenstein said. 
Vancko of NERC said the current spate of good news about California's power 
situation could soon be a memory. ``Nobody thinks this is more than a 
temporary respite,'' she said. ``We may have dodged the bullet but we haven't 
bitten it.''










Western Utilities Appeal To Protect Their Customers California Bail-Out by 
FERC Threatens to Increase Bills for Millions of Customers 

July 20, 2001    <JavaScript:userButton(> <JavaScript:userButton(>  BELLEVUE, 
Wash.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 19, 2001 via NewsEdge Corporation -  West-wide 
price controls on electricity implemented June 19 by the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission threaten to prolong the energy crisis affecting the 
West, according to petitions filed today with FERC by utilities serving 
millions of customers.  If not revised, the price controls will quickly 
result in higher bills for those customers.  "The FERC action in June was 
focused solely on solving the immediate crisis in California," said Tim 
Hogan, Puget Sound Energy's vice president, External Affairs. "The unintended 
consequence is that it has aggravated the crisis for utilities and their 
customers in surrounding states, as we experienced during the early July 
blackouts in Nevada." In addition, one western utility, Avista Corp. of 
Spokane, Wash., on July 18 announced a 37 percent power cost surcharge filing 
as a direct result of the FERC price controls.  In today's FERC filing, Puget 
Sound Energy said price controls are discouraging new generating facilities 
and demand-side management programs in the West, which will cause the current 
shortage of power to continue, resulting in extended periods of high consumer 
costs. Already, more than 1,300 megawatts of planned new generation for the 
region have been cancelled due to the effects of the price controls.  
Utilities routinely sell on the wholesale market excess power and rely on 
those sales to offset purchases they have to make when their customers need 
additional power. The price controls, as currently structured, threaten to 
force utilities to sell power at a loss, resulting in additional costs that 
will have to be passed on to their customers.  "Puget Sound Energy customers, 
as well as those of other utilities, are the ones who are at risk of paying 
the price for the California bail-out under the current FERC plan," Hogan 
said. "Our ability to continue the successful effort to balance our energy 
portfolio and keep customers' rates stable has been damaged during the rush 
to solve California's problem."  PSE and other utilities filing today asked 
FERC to review its June 19 order and make modifications to the price controls 
that will not only stabilize wholesale prices in California, but also prevent 
the crisis from spreading to other states. The recommended changes would 
allow the market to set prices that would encourage new generation and allow 
utilities to effectively manage their energy purchases and sales so their 
customers would not pay higher costs.  CONTACT: Puget Sound Energy | Media

National Desk; Section A 
Rate Proposal For Electricity In California 

07/20/2001 
The New York Times 
Page 15, Column 1 
c. 2001 New York Times Company 
SAN FRANCISCO, July 19 -- A proposed agreement between state regulators and 
the agency that buys electricity for millions of Californians would allow the 
state to raise electric rates without outside review. 
The California Public Utilities Commission issued the agreement on Wednesday 
and it will become effective after a period for public comment in August. 
The proposal explains how the commission will work with the Department of 
Water Resources to ensure that the state is repaid for the billions of 
dollars it has spent buying electricity for customers of three financially 
ailing utilities. 
In the agreement, the commission vows to assess electric rates at least 
annually and adjust them so the department has enough money to pay for its 
power purchases and administrative costs. 
Harvey Rosenfield, the president of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer 
Rights, said on Wednesday that under the agreement the commission waived the 
right to deny a rate increase if it was deemed unfair to California 
ratepayers. Mr. Rosenfield said the agreement gave unelected officials ''the 
unilateral right to order rate increases for the next 15 years.'' 
Geoff Dryvynsyde, a legal adviser at the Public Utilities Commission, said 
the commission would be ''no longer in charge of determining what costs are 
reasonable before it changes rates.'' 
The commission's agreement is a vital step toward California 's efforts to 
issue $13 billion in bonds to recoup the more than $8 billion it has spent 
since January buying electricity . 
California wants to improve its credit rating to lower interest rates on the 
bonds and to assure Wall Street of a reliable stream of money rolling in from 
electric rates. 
In May, the Public Utilities Commission issued a record rate increase that 
followed another January increase of roughly 10 percent. 
The state has bought electricity for the customers of three companies since 
January, when the utilities warned the state that high power prices and the 
inability to recoup their costs through frozen electric rates were driving 
them into bankruptcy. 








Metro Desk 
Edison Bailout Bills Remain Stalled
MIGUEL BUSTILLO; CARL INGRAM

SACRAMENTO -- Leading lawmakers conceded they would probably leave on their 
summer break without passing legislation aimed at rescuing Southern 
California Edison from its financial straits as competing bailouts stalled in 
the Legislature Thursday. 
The Assembly is expected to consider one of two rival measures to save Edison 
today, and the Senate is expected to take up an Edison rescue deal of its 
own. 
But all three pending measures face long odds and none have sufficient 
support to clear both houses, legislative leaders said. 
With the Legislature set to quit for the summer as early as today, the 
leaders predicted they would be forced to continue negotiations during the 
monthlong recess in hopes of brokering a deal. 
"I can't imagine that in the next 24 hours" lawmakers will reach consensus on 
an Edison rescue, said Assemblyman Fred Keeley (D-Boulder Creek), who 
coauthored one of the lower house's rescue bills with Assembly Speaker Bob 
Hertzberg (D-Sherman Oaks). 
One indication of the lack of enthusiasm for the legislation is that Keeley 
himself does not support the measure that bears his name. "I don't believe 
that this bill in its current form should become law," he said. "This bill is 
not ready." 
The maneuvering in both houses Thursday capped a day of frenetic activity in 
the state Capitol, which has become flooded with cell phone-carrying 
lobbyists seeking to influence the Edison deal for seemingly every special 
interest in the state. 
Yet amid the flurry of action, there seemed little chance of actually making 
law. Many of the participants said the legislative debate appeared to be less 
an attempt to pass a bill than a war of one-upsmanship between the houses to 
see who could "lob a grenade" into the rival house and go home until August. 
That way, if Edison soon winds up in Bankruptcy Court, leaders of each house 
could argue they were not to blame. 
Hoping to head off a growing sentiment among lawmakers that bankruptcy may 
not be such a bad alternative, Gov. Gray Davis spent the day working the 
phones in hopes of persuading legislators that a government rescue of Edison 
would be good for the state. 
To avoid mass blackouts, California has been purchasing billions of dollars 
worth of electricity since the beginning of this year because the state's two 
largest private utilities, Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric, are no longer 
credit-worthy enough to buy power on behalf of their customers. 
The utilities lost that status and ran up billions in debt the last two years 
because they were paying high prices for power on the wholesale market and 
could not recover those costs from customers because of a state-imposed rate 
freeze. 
As a result, the state government is stuck in the power-buying business until 
the utilities regain their financial footing--an expensive predicament that 
threatens the state's financial health. 
Davis attempted to head off the crisis by negotiating rescues of the two 
utilities, but PG&E lost faith in the talks and opted to take itself into 
Bankruptcy Court in April, embarrassing the Democratic governor. 
Days later, Davis reached a tentative rescue deal with Southern California 
Edison. But the plan hit the Legislature with a thud amid concerns it was 
overly generous to Edison, and it has languished for months. 
Last week, lawmakers finally picked up the pace and began moving forward with 
a series of competing proposals to alter the governor's deal with Edison. But 
it was clear from the outset that no consensus had emerged, and many 
lawmakers are becoming convinced that legislative inaction--even if it means 
bankruptcy--may be the best way to resolve Edison's financial predicament. 
"We're bailing out people who don't need to be bailed out," said Sen. Ross 
Johnson (R-Irvine). 
Legislative leaders hoped to pass something before today when the Assembly 
and Senate are scheduled to break for their traditional summer recess. The 
date is considered important because Edison and Davis had set an Aug. 15 
deadline for lawmakers to take action on the rescue deal. If no bill is 
passed by then--as seems likely--the utility has the right to walk away from 
negotiations. 
However, it became evident Thursday that the dueling measures making their 
way through both houses lacked strong support. 
In the Assembly, the Hertzberg-Keeley bill, a modification of Davis' original 
plan, was competing against a rival bill by Assemblyman Rod Wright (D-Los 
Angeles), who had teamed with Republicans to push what he bluntly called a 
"straight bailout" of Edison. 
In the Senate, Davis' original plan was amended by Sen. Byron Sher 
(D-Stanford) and turned into a trimmed-down rescue plan that was opposed by 
Edison. 
Sher's bill was voted down twice in policy committees Wednesday and Thursday, 
but it was resuscitated both times, and is now on the Senate floor.

Enron Replaces Andrew Fastow as CFO Amid SEC Inquiry (Update1)

Enron Replaces Andrew Fastow as CFO Amid SEC Inquiry (Update1)

     (Adds statement from Enron's Kenneth Lay in second
paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 24 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. ousted Chief
Financial Officer Andrew Fastow amid a Securities and Exchange
Commission inquiry into partnerships he ran that cost the largest
energy trader $35 million.

     Enron named Jeff McMahon, head of its industrial markets
group, as CFO because ``it became clear to me that restoring
investor confidence would require us to replace Andy,'' Chairman
and chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay said in a statement.
Fastow will take a leave of absence.

     Shares of Enron, based in Houston, fell as much as 22 percent
today after analysts downgraded the stock. The company said on
Monday that the SEC had begun an inquiry into partnerships Fastow
ran.

     Enron fell $3.38, or 17 percent, to $16.41, the sixth
straight day of decline. Earlier, the shares touched $15.51, their
lowest since February 1995. The stock plunged 21 percent on
Monday, after Enron disclosed that the SEC had requested
information on the partnerships.

     The stock fell after Lay failed to ease concerns about the
SEC inquiry or Enron's financial reporting in a conference call
yesterday. Investors have criticized Lay for not disclosing enough
about the workings of investment vehicles such as Fastow's
partnerships. The stock has fallen 57 percent since Oct. 11,
losing more than $15 billion in market value.

Enron Shares Drop for Sixth Day on Stock Downgrades (Update5)

      (Updates with closing share price and Fastow on leave of
absence in second paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 24 (Bloomberg) -- Shares of Enron Corp. fell 17
percent after several analysts downgraded the stock and the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission began an inquiry into
partnerships run by Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow.

     Enron fell $3.38 to $17.08, dropping for the sixth day in a
row. It was the biggest percentage decline among stocks in the
Standard & Poor's 500 Index. Earlier, the stock touched $15.51,
the lowest since February 1995. After the close of regular U.S.
trading, Enron said Fastow will take a leave of absence, and Jeff
McMahon was named chief financial officer.

     Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay failed to ease concerns
about the SEC inquiry or Enron's financial reporting in a
conference call yesterday. Investors have criticized Lay for not
revealing enough about the workings of investment vehicles such as
Fastow's partnerships. The stock has fallen 57 percent since Oct.
11, losing more than $15 billion in market value.

     ``Enron's conference call began as a methodical review of
current liquidity and deteriorated into an inadequate defense of
the balance sheet,'' Lehman Brothers analyst Richard Gross wrote
in a report. He left his ``strong buy'' rating unchanged.

     Other analysts lowered their ratings, including Carol Coale
at Prudential Securities who downgraded Enron to ``sell'' from
``hold.'' Anatol Feygin of J.P. Morgan dropped his rating to long-
term ``buy'' from ``buy.'' First Albany Corp.'s Robert Christensen
downgraded the stock to ``buy'' from ``strong buy.''

                        Possible Downgrade

     Moody's Investors Service last week placed all $13 billion of
the company's long-term debt securities on watch for possible
downgrade. A reduction in the rating could cut Houston-based Enron
off from the commercial paper market, raising the costs of short-
term debt.

     Enron said earlier this month that dealings with the Fastow
partnerships contributed to $1.01 billion in third-quarter losses.
Enron has at least 18 such partnerships, which were created to
move debt off its books and lower its tax liabilities as well as
dispose of assets.

     An investor has sued Enron saying that Fastow's leadership of
the partnerships, as well as membership on their boards by other
Enron executives, is a conflict of interest. The company has $3.3
billion in potential liabilities attached to such investment
vehicles, the Wall Street Journal reported today.

     ``I don't know that we were aware of everything going on with
Enron,'' said Jim Walline, manager of the Lutheran Brotherhood
Fund, which owned 93,060 shares on Sept. 1. ``We had a lot of
confidence and clearly that has been busted a little.''

STOCKWATCH Enron falls 20 pct on worries deals with LJM will impact earnings

10/24/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd
NEW YORK (AFX) - Shares of Enron Corp were sharply lower in afternoon trade, falling over 20 pct, as investors sold the stock a third day running on concerns that financial transactions made with related party LJM could negatively impact future earnings, dealers said. 
At 2.15 pm, Enron was down 4.06 usd, or 20.52 pct, at 15.73. 
The DJIA was up 9.76 points at 9,349.77, and the S&P 500 composite index was up 0.92 at 1,085.70, while the Nasdaq composite fell 22.42 to 1,726.96.
The company confirmed yesterday that the Securities and Exchange Commission requested the company to provide information on certain related-party transactions. 
Many analysts responded by cutting the shares ratings on concerns that dealings with the related LJM partnership could affect future earnings, after two class actions were filed against the company yesterday. 
The two lawsuits claim that Enron issued statements which failed to disclose that the company was experiencing a declining demand for bandwidth and that its efforts to create a trading market for bandwidth failed because many market participants were not credit worthy. 
The company's operating results were also "materially overstated as result of the company failure to timely write down the value of its investments with certain limited partnerships" managed by the company's CFO. 
The suit additionally alleged that Enron failed to write down impaired assets on a timely basis in accordance with GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles). 
In its third-quarter results last week, Enron announced a charge of 1.01 bln usd, or 1.11 usd per share, and an incremental 1.2 bln usd reduction in stockholders' equity, related to the unwinding of investments with the LJM partnerships. 
JP Morgan analyst Anatol Feygin said he has downgraded the stock to a 'long-term buy' from a 'buy' in "the wake of lingering concerns regarding the company's credit situation and management disclosure of liabilities stemming from off-balance sheet financing vehicles." 
The stock has been removed from JP Morgan's "focus list". 
Feygin also said that "management's conference call yesterday morning was a missed opportunity to disclose the necessary information to assuage investor concerns." 
Goldman Sachs analyst, David Fleischer also agreed that Enron's disclosure was "modest" and "management did not resolve concerns." 
However, credit concerns and questions about potential liabilities are "very much exaggerated," he said 
"The real issue will turn out to be huge debt that Enron was placing in these entities." 
The shares' value have fallen by more than 40 pct since Enron reported charges related to investments with LJM last week, but Fleischer said he sees no recovery until management fully answers investor questions and restores credibility, an outcome he expects in future weeks.

USA: Enron shares take midday battering, off over 20 pct.
By Janet McGurty

Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
NEW YORK, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Shares of Enron Corp. plunged further in midday trade on Wednesday, hugging the top spot on the list of biggest losers on the New York Stock Exchange, on concerns whether financial deals made by North America's largest buyer and seller of electricity and natural gas could negatively affect earnings going ahead. 
Shares were trading down 20.87 percent, or $4.13, to $15.66 in midday trade, capping over a 75 percent decline this year in share price. As of Tuesday, the company has lost more than $10 billion in value in the past week.
Some analysts cut ratings or expressed concerns about the former high flyer's lack of forthrightness in discussing business deals, unimpressed by management's attempts on Tuesday to pacify investor concerns about transactions involving Enron, its chief financial officer, and two limited partnerships - all of which are being looked into by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 
Enron on Tuesday rejected suggestions the transactions were a conflict of interest, saying the deals were disclosed in SEC filings and approved by its board and internal and external auditors. 
Enron, which reported a loss and a $1.01 billion in charges for bad investments in the third-quarter, failed to mention a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder value, and was less than forthcoming during a call with analysts and investors the next day.

NEW YORK, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Enron Corp.'s stock slumped further on Wednesday after Prudential Securities cut its rating on the energy trader to "sell" on concern management is not being forthright about the onetime high flyer. 
After an hour of trading, Enron stock was the biggest percentage loser on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares plunged $3.99, or 20.2 percent, to $15.80 - the lowest price paid for the stock since August 1995.
Enron has tumbled since last week it announced it's first quarterly loss in more than four years and said it would take $1.01 billion in charges on ill-fated investments. The stock closed at $33.84 on Oct. 16, when its results were announced. 
Prudential analyst Carol Coale said the rating cut from "hold" was not made "because of things that we know but because of things that we potentially don't know about the company."

CNNfn: Market Coverage - Morning
(c) Copyright Federal Document Clearing House. All Rights Reserved.
CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNNfn ANCHOR, MARKET CALL: Now, joining us by phone to talk about his move on Enron (URL: http://.www.enron.com/) is Anatol Feygin, energy analyst at JP Morgan. Thank you for joining us. 
ANATOL FEYGIN, JP MORGAN: Thanks for having me.
ROMANS: OK. Enron, last week, these shares lost some 28 or 29 percent of their value, continued to fall yesterday, and Monday. What`s going on here why you`re downgrade - how concerned are you about in visibility management in the issues that we`re talking about here? 
FEYGIN: Well, extremely concerned and until Thursday of last week, I felt that a lot the information coming out was old news and was not critical to the fundamentals of the company. On Friday of last week the credit market started to really get jittery and spreads on Enron`s credit started to blow out and that could threaten the fundamental business. Yesterday management had a opportunity to set the record straight on a conference call. I think that was a big opportunity missed. And until management comes out and reassures the credit markets, primarily, and then the equities markets, there is risk to the fundamental business which I still consider to be the premiere energy marketing and trading franchise that`s functioning well today, but it at risk because of credit issues. 
BARRY HYMAN, EHRENKRANTZ KING NUSSBAUM: Anatol, what exactly are these off balance sheets financing vehicle, that is of concern here, that management been reluctant to talk about? 
FEYGIN: There are two transaction still left. One called Marlin and one called White Wing or Osprey. In Marlin, it`s basically a 1/3 ownership of a U.K water utility that Enron acquired in the October of `98. Part of that taken public and `99. That was bought back in by Enron this year. And problem is that entity, the assets of Zurichs, which has this Wessex water business in the U.K., are not enough to payoff the creditors in Marlin. So, Enron is on the hook for a portion of the equity that has back stopped this investment by Marlin. And we estimate that to be in the hundreds of millions not in the billion dollar range, which I think the market fears. 
White Wing is a very similar structure, less transparent because that`s a collection of assets. Things like, roughly half of Enron`s investment in Brazil, its European power plants and et cetera and it`s difficult to reconcile of what value of those asset is. And there is a possibly that Enron have issue up to 2.4 billion in equity to make whole the investors in White Wing. 
ROMANS: OK, Anatol Feygin, JP Morgan, thank you very much. Lots of other analysts saying that the conference call with the company didn`t really clear up some of the questions they had.

UK: Credit costs surge on embattled Enron - telcos ease.
By Tom Burroughes

10/24/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
LONDON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - The cost of protection surged on the debt of U.S. energy titan Enron Corp on reports of potential shortfalls in some of its investment vehicles, days after it said U.S. regulators were looking at some of its deals. 
"An investigation hanging over you can never be a good thing. The market is very angry with them (Enron) at the moment," a European bank dealer said.
Adding to the pressure, the online edition of the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday cited Enron Treasurer Ben Glisan outlining contingency plans for repaying about $3.3 billion in guaranteed notes falling due during the next 20 months. 
In the credit derivatives market, Enron five-year default swaps were last seen trading on a bid/offer spread of 500/600 basis points (bps), up about 200 bps from late last week, a dealer for a European bank said. 
Default swaps are insurance-type tools giving investors the ability to hedge or gain the risk of an issuer defaulting on a loan or bond. The protection buyer pays the seller an annual premium, measured in a basis points. 
The dealer added that the cost of five-year protection on the debt of Enron traded as low as 150 bps back in August. 
On Monday Enron said it was cooperating with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission, which was looking into some of its deals. The SEC and Enron have declined to give details, although the Wall Street Journal said the transactions raised "conflict-of-interest" issues. 
Investor confidence in Enron has been hit by recent reports about transactions and two limited partnerships that were run until recently by Enron's chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. 
The company has been under pressure over the past year. Last week it reported its first quarterly loss in more than four years. 
TELECOMS COME DOWN 
In contrast, five-year credit protection slipped on European telecoms, which benefitted from stronger equity prices and some selling pressure on default swaps connected to portfolio deals, traders said. 
Telecom Italia was cited by traders at 180/220 bps, down about 20 bps from Monday. Five-year protection on Italian telecoms giant Olivetti was shown at 300/400 bps, about 50 bps down on a week ago, another European bank trader said. 
British Telecom was quoted five basis points tighter from Tuesday at 100/110 bps; France Telecom was unchanged from Tuesday at 180/195 bps, and Deutsche Telecom was down about 10 bps at 140/150 bps, traders added. Vodafone was quoted two basis points lower from late Tuesday at 83/93 bps, with Telefonica put at 100/110 bps in five-year default swaps, about five basis points lower. 
Stronger equity prices helped alleviate some concerns about the telecom sector's financial health, although problems remain for many firms labouring under heavy debt burdens, a dealer for a European bank said. 
He added that some default swap selling pressure was coming from players arranging synthetic portfolio products such as collateralised debt obligations (CDOs) before the end of the year. CDOs are portfolios of bonds and other debt obligations. The arranger issues bonds, secured by the underlying assets to fund the deal. In a synthetic CDO, the arranger sells default swaps on groups of debt in one hit to mimic the asset pool. 
Elsewhere, dealers saw small declines in protection costs on the debt of carmakers, with U.S.-German giant DaimlerChrysler trading several times. 
A U.S. bank dealer nonethless saw it little changed on the day in five-year default swaps at 190/200 bps.

Enron may need several hundred mln usd to meet shortfalls at investment units

10/24/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd
LONDON (AFX) - Enron Corp might have to come up with several hundred million dollars or more in the next 20 months to cover potential shortfalls in investment vehicles it created, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing an interview with Enron Treasurer Ben Glisan. 
Covering such shortfalls could involve issuing additional Enron shares, diluting the position of current shareholders, the paper said.
However, Glisan said the company believes it can repay about 3.3 bln usd in notes that were sold by those investment vehicles without having to resort to issuing more stock. 
The notes were sold to investors during recent years by several entities -- known as the Marlin Water Trust II, the Marlin Water Capital Corp II, the Osprey Trust and Osprey I Inc. The notes are coming due during the next 20 months. 
Glisan said assets from the entities could be sold to pay off some of the notes. Also, Enron is selling other assets. Proceeds from those transactions also could go toward repaying the notes, which ultimately are guaranteed by Enron. 
He said it appears that asset sales will raise at least 2.2 bln usd by the end of next year. This amount includes cash proceeds of 1.55 bln usd from the previously announced sale of Enron's Portland General Electric utility unit. 
"There are a number of other assets we believe will raise sufficient proceeds" to repay the notes, Glisan was quoted as saying. "But if we are wrong, we will issue equity." 
Glisan said a worst-case scenario would involve issuing as much as 1 bln usd in stock. Enron said it has about 850 mln shares outstanding. 
Making up any shortfall with equity has become more expensive because of the drop in Enron's share price. During the past week, shares of the energy-trading giant have dropped more than 40 pct.

Enron shares plummet again
Drop comes on heels of five straight losing sessions 
CBS MarketWatch.com
Lisa Sanders
10/24/01
NEW YORK (CBS.MW) -- Enron shares plunged Wednesday, one day after the energy merchant attempted to restore investor confidence following a series of negative developments at the company.
Shares of Enron fell to an intraday low of $15.51, eclipsing a low of $15.81 set in March and August of 1995. Enron stock was last at $15.69, down $4.10, or 20.7 percent. Volume was extremely heavy at 49 million shares.
Several Wall Street firms cut their ratings on Enron shares Wednesday, including Prudential Securities. The firm advised clients to sell the stock, a rare recommendation. Prudential had rated the company's shares a "hold."
"After much consideration, we are lowering our rating ... not because of things we know but because of things we potentially don't know about the company," wrote Prudential analyst Carol Coale in a note.
Enron has been under fire since last week as questions have surfaced about its accounting practices, especially in regard to two limited partnerships created by the company in 1999 and since dissolved. 
On Monday, Enron announced that related-party transactions within the limited partnerships are under review by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Several shareholder lawsuits have been filed as a result.
"Management used the SEC inquiry as a shield to avoid elaboration on the issue at hand, the LJM transactions," Coale said in reference to Tuesday's conference call with the investment community.
J.P. Morgan's Anatol Feygin downgraded his rating to "long-term buy" from "buy," saying an upgrade is precluded until the company provides more information about its liabilities.
"Management's conference call yesterday was a missed opportunity to disclose the necessary information to assuage investor concerns," Feygin wrote.
The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that Enron might have to issue stock to cover notes coming due on various investment vehicles created by the company. Currently, Enron expects to use proceeds from asset sales to meet the obligations.
Merrill Lynch analyst Donato Eassey noted Wednesday that if Enron isn't able to maintain its investment-grade ratings -- the company's debt is on watch for a potential downgrade by Moody's Investors Service -- issuing new equity would be one course of action, though with the potential to reduce earnings-per-share. Enron on Tuesday held with its forecast of $1.80 a share for 2001.
"New equity would potentially dilute our EPS estimates 5 to 10 percent," Eassey wrote in a follow-up to the conference call.
But Eassey believes that cash flow from operations -- expected to exceed $3 billion in 2002 -- along with asset sales, should be enough to "insulate" the company's credit ratings.

Enron's Bonds Tell the Tale: Stay Away

Updated from 2:47 p.m. EDT 
If you ever have questions about whether a battered stock is cheap, check out its bonds. Bond analysts almost always know best because they're looking at the guts of a company -- the ability of a company to service its debt. If it can't service the debt, stockholders are at a greater risk of getting pummeled because debtholders always come before stockholders when it comes to getting paid. 
Which brings us to Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) . The only reason to mention it is that some analysts are really reiterating buys based on its low multiple. (Low, fellas, is relative to reality!) Cramer today talks about his hunch that the stock is vulnerable because, as he says, "accounting irregularities = sell." 
Good point. Now let's back that up with the bond market's view, which can be seen in the so-called "swap spread," which is bond-traderspeak for the spread between the LIBOR interest rate and the interest rate for comparable paper, or swaps. It's a benchmark bond traders use to determine risk. Tuesday, that spread on Enron's five-year notes was 650 basis points, or about 6.5 percentage points. Today, it's 1,000 points, or 10 percentage points. As one bond trader told me today, anybody would be crazy to pay that much. Another bond trader told another friend the same thing. 
Why? As of June 30, Enron had cash of just $847 million and debt of nearly $13 billion. 
And this observation: Those five-year notes currently yield more than 11%. That's a junk-bond yield for what is still rated as an investment-grade debt; anything more than 9% is considered ultra-high risk. So while you can make 11%, that's still not enough "where the accounting is questionable," one bond trader says. "You're not being adequately compensated for the fact that the company could default. You have to worry about your recovery value." 
Not the kind of risk/reward an investor wants to see when the company in question still has a market cap of about $12.5 billion with a capital B. 
Speaking of bonds and stocks: Even with its stock at about $1.16, Global Crossing (GX:NYSE - news - commentary) still has a market cap that exceeds $1 billion. But while its stock has rallied, its bank debt has stayed relatively flat at around 50 cents to 53 cents on the dollar. Similar stories can be told for XO Communications (XOXO:Nasdaq - news - commentary) , with a market cap of about $473 million and bank debt trading at around 52 cents on the dollar; Level 3 Communications (LVLT:Nasdaq - news - commentary) , with a market cap of $1.2 billion and bank debt trading at 66 cents; and McLeodUSA (MCLD:Nasdaq - news - commentary) , with a market cap of $462 million and debt that trades at 53 cents. 
Where are opportunistic bond investors, who should be hopping on such cheap debt -- especially bank debt, which is at the top of the getting-paid-back food chain? They're nowhere to be seen, for the same reasons they're not jumping to buy Enron's bonds: Too much risk, because when companies like those go bad, their assets trade for less than the bonds are currently trading. (Try telling that to "hope-springs-eternal" stock investors!) 
Providian pratfalls: Turns out an item here back in May was more fortuitous than it appeared. The item noted how institutional bond investors, who often pony up a slight premium to LIBOR to buy so-called credit default-protection insurance, couldn't find any at any price for Providian (PVN:NYSE - news - commentary) . The insurance is sold by investment banks such as J.P. Morgan Chase and typically involves a complex hedge of stocks and options that requires an investor to take the other side of the trade. If nobody'll take the other side of the trade -- or will charge a ridiculously high price to do so -- investors should beware. Which brings us back to Enron: It is possible to buy credit insurance, but at more than a whopping 1,000 basis points over LIBOR. Hardly a vote of confidence.

Accounting irregularities = sell. Those three words and an equals sign have always served me well. They remain squarely posted on the base of my quote machine, always in view. They have never let me down. When I have deviated from them I have had to pay severely, as I did when I ignored the accounting irregularities in Cendant (CD:NYSE - news - commentary) initially or when, because of my four-month holding period, I couldn't sell Qwest (Q:NYSE - news - commentary) . 
Which is why I came in with guns blazing on this Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) , telling you to sell it. The stock has now lost half its value and all I can say is, I still can't see why you have to tempt fate and own this one. The notion that the businesses are fundamentally sound, that it has a great core business, is just hokum. Who the heck knows? Who has any idea of what this company can really earn? Who knows what it did earn? 
All I know is that soon the drumbeat will be on from the Democrats that the Justice Department is playing political favorites by not pursuing Enron (noted Republican-giving company) for alleged fraud. 
When that happens, when that shoe drops, wherever Enron is, then maybe it is worth some scrutiny. 
But I bet I still won't like it. 


Enron's Excuses Sound Familiar

If you disclose something that is wrong, and you get accountants to check off that wrong deed, and outside lawyers to check off on that wrong deed, is it therefore right? 
That's what Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) is asking us to believe. By telling us that its ridiculous dealings with the chief financial officer and his private partnership were all sanctioned by outside professionals, they have simply compounded the error. Next they will tell us that Janus, the largest shareholder, knew and wanted those partnerships to generate upside surprises! 
What they are doing at Enron is, well, positively -- here we go -- '80s! In the '80s, you had all of these savings-and-loan jokers pleading that the outside accountants and lawyers checked off on massive chicanery. Somehow it was supposed to make the chicanery kosher. 
Nope. 
What it ended up doing was getting the lawyers and accountants in trouble. The government ended up going after them, too, for abetting the travesties. 
Enron didn't use taxpayers' money, so it is arguably not as clear-cut. But the more we probe this Enron, the more we check it out, the more we know it really stinks and that Jeffrey Skilling didn't leave because the stock got hammered, or some other authentic Wall Street gibberish, but because of this nasty, unseemly situation. 
We don't want an SEC probe here. We want a Justice Department probe. This isn't about unclear disclosure. This could end up being about fraud. 
In the meantime, I wouldn't touch this stock with a 10-foot pole. This one's gonna get real nasty before it gets nice. If it ever does. 

FOOL ON THE HILL 
Enron's Disdain for Investors 
The Motley Fool.com
10/24/01
While recent coverage of Enron centers on the CFO's past partnerships, a smaller -- and more obvious -- omission is what should really make individual investors turn the heat up on this company. Not only does it not release its cash flow statement during each quarter's conference call and press release, something we don't like but is prevalent, it also doesn't release its balance sheet. The company must think we're idiots. They're wrong. 
By Tom Jacobs <<http://www.fool.com/About/staff/tomj.htm>> (TMF Tom9) 
October 24, 2001 
Enron's (NYSE: ENE) <<http://quote.fool.com/uberdata.asp?symbols=ENE>> troubles just don't stop. On Monday, the company announced <<http://www.enron.com/corp/pressroom/releases/2001/ene/70-LJMfinalltr.html>> that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had requested information on "certain related party transactions <<http://www.fool.com/specials/2001/sp010802e.htm>>." That was a veiled reference to partnerships until recently organized and directed by Enron CFO Andrew Fastow. There has been a flurry -- a hailstorm -- of financial media attention to this. There are only three possibilities, and none is palatable:
The company's board allowed this deal in order to -- using corporate speak -- "incentivize" the CFO, and it was not legal; 
It was legal, but unethical; or 
Enron has been less than forthcoming, perpetuating a pattern of disdain for investors and keeping them in the dark. 
The accounting machinations involve mind-numbing terms and obfuscation, making a simple explanation of what is being alleged above my capacity to provide. The New York Times' Floyd Norris calls them "some of the most opaque transactions with insiders ever seen." That leads me to one conclusion when I think about burying myself with the company's SEC filings, accounting texts, my high-speed Web connection, and some beer: that of Shakespeare's King Lear -- "that way madness lies." 
On the one hand, I know that pulling all this apart might teach me useful things about accounting, reading financial statements, and finding trouble. (To read what this is all about, check the "Certain Transactions" section of the company's latest proxy statement <<http://quote.fool.com/sec/sec.asp?date=03/27/2001&currTicker=ene&symbols=ene&guid=%7B5D0F1D1D%2D5DB7%2D4F4E%2D9BD9%2DFA154603F662%7D>>.) I fully intend to do that -- someday. For now, though, all I need to know about Enron as an investment is that the company has not made these issues transparent.
What's worse, though, is that Enron has made it a habit to keep investors in the dark, and not only about the potentially troublesome CFO issue. The company goes out of its way to hide its true financials. That really cheeses me off.
The quarterly call and press release parade
Most companies hold quarterly conference calls and simultaneously spew press releases (for which the companies pay good money to Business Wire and PR Newswire for dissemination) that allegedly state their latest quarter's numbers and talk about the business. Sometimes, when they have cleaned off their glasses enough for visibility and run it by their lawyers, execs will even venture to speak about the business climate ahead. At least thanks to Regulation Fair Disclosure <<http://www.fool.com/Specials/2001/sp010418.htm>> -- "Reg. FD" -- analysts don't get a secret call with the "real" numbers at another time than the public. We like that.
Perhaps in a world of pro forma numbers <<http://aol.fool.com/portfolios/rulemaker/2001/rulemaker010815.htm>> and EBITDA <<http://aol.fool.com/portfolios/rulemaker/2001/rulemaker010906.htm>> -- both of which Phil Weiss has skewered appropriately in past columns -- the calls and press releases could never be expected to be that substantive. That makes individual investors increasingly correct to greet such information with cries of "bullfeathers!" It only takes a few reviews of earnings press releases to make anyone a skeptic. The PR department carefully dresses them with spin, leaving the details for the fine print. Headline: "Earnings up!" (Revenues down 40%.) Headline: "Revenues up!" (Earnings down 40%.) The skullduggery of spin and pro forma mangles earnings to meaninglessness <<http://www.fool.com/news/foth/2001/foth010504.htm>>.
At least the conference calls themselves allow you a sense of managers as people and potentially some information about the business, but the financials are not helpful. Why? 
Hiding the cash flow statement
Because almost every company gives up only part of the financial picture at call and press release time. If the income statement is increasingly unhelpful, at least the balance sheet tells you whether the company has increased or decreased cash, right? Well, not quite.
You really need the cash flow statement -- the best measure of how the company's business actually performs. Even then, you may need to make further adjustments <<http://aol.fool.com/portfolios/rulemaker/2001/rulemaker010906.htm>>. Yet the overwhelming majority of companies do not provide the cash flow statement at the call and press release time. 
Check the companies you own. If they don't release cash flow statements with their earnings -- or, at least, prior to SEC filings, you should write and otherwise hound investor relations to push management to do so. Encourage your fellow investors to do so too, and tell the company that The Motley Fool sent ya. They will maintain that the numbers aren't ready at earnings time. Tell them to wait until they are. The numbers are certainly ready in time for the SEC deadline, and wouldn't we be happy to wait a week or two for the complete picture? Or, hey, why not do two releases -- one when the earnings are ready and another for the cash flow? 
If not releasing the cash flow statement were Enron's only sin, it wouldn't be that big a deal. It has plenty of company. But this pre-Halloween < <http://www.fool.com/specials/2001/sp011024.htm>> scary tale gets worse. Unfortunately for Enron investors, the company does the hide-the-cash-flow-statement gig one better.
Hiding the balance sheet
For at least the last three quarters that I checked, Enron hides the balance sheet until SEC filing time. That's right: Not just the cash flow statement, but the balance sheet too. All they release is the income statement -- though, in truth, it does provide pages of income statement information for its many businesses. But why fail to release the balance sheet?
The only conclusion can be that management doesn't want to show its cash balances until it can slip them into SEC filings it thinks people won't bother to read. When questioners on a conference call earlier this year urged former Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling to provide a balance sheet at earnings release, Skilling reportedly "called the questioner a common vulgarity that surprised many listeners."
Off his meds that day? Or a symptom of the company's attitude towards shareholders? Looks like the latter: Skilling's gone, but the practice hasn't changed. 
It's about management
We don't depend on management for the numbers during the quarterly public calls and releases. A publicly traded company's financials will appear a few weeks later through its SEC filings available through our Quotes & Data page <<http://quote.fool.com/>>. No investor should be buying -- or holding -- stock in companies if they don't read their filings carefully. It's hard enough to discern what's going on in a business without doing so, and even in those filings -- such as with options grants to management -- the real meat is buried in footnotes. Not reading 10-Qs and 10-Ks is like getting married without dating, or buying a car by paint color only.
What Enron's failure to release this information says is that its management and corporate governance are sub-par. It says management is willing to hold these events, but it'll be darned if it'll present anything meaningful or make it easy for individual investors to find out anything other than management's spin. In Enron's case, its former CEO heaped abuse on someone who dared ask for a change. Does that make Enron's earnings releases circuses? Draw your own conclusion.
Is management listening? Perhaps. It hastily pulled together a conference call yesterday. TMF community member emschulze took notes <<http://boards.fool.com/Message.asp?mid=15974151>>:
"On call, analyst asks why no balance sheet with recent earnings release given company's previous claim that it will work to offer investors greater transparency in measuring its performance... response was that balance sheet doesn't normally come together until the week after its earnings release and that it will be included in 10-Q to be filed by Nov. 14... CEO indicates that it will do a better job of improving timing of release of earnings and balance sheet in future, implying that investors won't have to wait all the way until 10-Q filing deadlines to see balance sheet."
That's a good sign. But until the company makes an unambiguous commitment to provide the balance sheet at earnings time, Enron should be in the doghouse. 
Good corporate governance means companies release all their quarterly financial statements and discuss them at the same time because today's income statements and pro forma numbers are borderline useless. If it means a delay or a second release to get the numbers together, what's the problem? Shareholders should demand no less. When a company trumpets an income statement, as Enron has, no one should be surprised when smoke appears. And perhaps much more.

Bonds Of Troubled Enron Quoted In Dollars, Not Spreads
By Michael C. Barr

Capital Markets Report

Of DOWJONES NEWSWIRES 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The bonds of embattled Enron Corp. (ENE) are trading on a dollar basis and not on a yield margin or spread to Treasurys - another sign of increasing investor skittishness about the once high flying energy trader.
The bonds, which carry investment-grade ratings, "started trading with a dollar price two days ago," said Gary Brown, managing director and head of corporate trading, Wachovia Securities, Charlotte, N.C. 
Bonds are being offered at dollar prices in the high 80's to low 90's, say traders. 
Investment grade bonds typically trade on a spread margin over comparable Treasury issues. "Credit bonds," which have questions about their quality, are traded in dollar quotes, said one analyst. 
Moody's Investors Service rates the company's senior unsecured debt Baa1, but recently placed the debt on review for downgrade. Both Standard & Poor's Corp. and Fitch rate the debt triple-B-plus. 
But the company "may be going into the double-B (non-investment grade) sector, " said Harold Rivkin, principal of H. Rivkin & Co., a distressed debt brokerage firm, Princeton, N.J. 
"I am starting to get inquiry from investment grade holders about the market for Enron bonds," Rivkin said, noting that some high-grade portfolios can't have paper below investment-grade. 
Houston-based Enron, the nation's biggest energy trader, recently announced a large third-quarter loss and an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission into a partnership arrangement that involves the company's chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow. 
Enron has approached Citicorp (C) about obtaining a possible $750 million loan, according to a source close to the bank. But the source indicated Tuesday that nothing has proceeded past the preliminary inquiry. 
The company's stock, while once a favorite of the investment community, has taken a pounding. It traded early this year at more than $80 a share. Late Wednesday, it was at $15.70 a share. 
And, in a reflection of current investor sentiment, for the second time this week analyst Carol Coale of Prudential Securities downgraded the company to a sell recommendation from a hold. Her concern is "not because of the things we know but because of the things that we potentially don't know."

USA: Group to put corporate directors under microscope.
By Kevin Drawbaugh

10/24/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
WASHINGTON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Directors of corporations will be graded according to their performance by a service expected to be launched soon by business research group The Corporate Library, the group's cofounder said on Wednesday. 
In a move that could cause some sweaty palms in boardrooms across the country, long-time shareholder activist Nell Minow said directors will be awarded grades of A, B, C and lower, based on meeting attendance and other benchmarks.
"It's always been my dream to rate individual directors like bonds. Directors have not had the scrutiny they deserve," said Minow, who said the service will be called Board Analyst. 
Planned as an added feature on an existing Web site, thecorporatelibrary.com, Board Analyst is still in testing stages but is expected to launch next year, she said. 
Only directors of U.S. companies will initially be evaluated. Non-U.S. directors may be added later. 
Minow and partner Robert Monks have written several books on corporate governance and shareholder rights. They formerly managed the Washington-based shareholder activist Lens Fund, which they sold last year to British fund management group Hermes. 
Their latest venture may find a receptive audience on the institutional buy-side, said industry spokespersons. 
"There's been growing interest within our membership in board membership, in general, and individual directors, in particular. I definitely think there would be interest in more information on individual directors," said Ann Yerger, spokeswoman for the Council of Institutional Investors, which represents America's large pension funds. 
The corporate governance movement since its beginnings in the 1970s has focused on making directors more accountable and responsible. Many companies have responded by requiring more outside directors and more meaningful stock ownership among directors. But examples of lax board oversight still abound. 
One example would be Enron Corp. , whose stock has plunged in recent days since the company said the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating transactions involving certain outside partnerships and the company's chief financial officer, Minow said. 
"Where was the Enron board in all of this?" she asked. "Boards and outside consultants are supposed to vet ideas for partnerships like these. That apparently didn't happen here." 
Taking the corporate governance argument a step further, Minow argued that effective board membership is more than a theoretical question. It should be an issue for investors to evaluate when they consider buying stock in a company. 
"This isn't just a corporate governance thing. This is part of investment analysis," she said. 
Institutional investors routinely examine corporate management when analyzing stocks. Whether they will begin to examine directors, as well, remained an open question. 
"Nell and Bob Monks have been shareholder activists for a long time and have moved corporate governance in a positive direction," said Peter Gleason, vice president of research and development at the National Association of Corporate Directors, which represents more than 3,000 corporate directors. 
Surveys by the association recently showed that corporate directors rank self-evaluation high on their list of concerns. "More and more directors are saying this is something we should be doing," Gleason said.

Enron, a Giant Bargain
By Richard A Oppel Jr.

The New York Times

c. 2001 New York Times Company

With its principal business in peril, Enron agreed to be acquired by Dynegy for $9 billion -- one-ninth what it was worth last year. Enron, of Houston, used political muscle and trading-floor savvy to create new markets for electricity and gas and become the nation's dominant energy trader. Yet its refusal to explain its finances caught up to it last month, when investors fled after disclosure of an S.E.C. probe and an unusual $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity. After it admitted overstating profits by $600 million, other energy companies began to shun Enron, putting its trading business in jeopardy. Finally, a humbled Enron, out of options, threw itself into the arms of Dynegy, its much smaller crosstown rival. Richard A. Oppel Jr.

Dow Breaks Through Pre-Attack Level

c. 2001 New York Times Company

Stocks posted big gains this past week, pushing the Dow Jones industrial average to its highest close since the Sept. 11 attacks. 
The Federal Reserve's half-point reduction of short-term interest rates on Tuesday, to 2 percent -- the 10th cut this year -- was a big reason for the advance. Investors bought stocks on optimism that the latest cut would finally help stimulate the economy.
Equities got a further lift when reports emerged on Friday that seemed to run counter to the Fed's prediction that the economy would worsen, suggesting an economic turnaround had already started. The University of Michigan's monthly index of consumer sentiment, a widely followed barometer, showed a November improvement in attitudes about finances and the economy. 
For the week, the Dow Jones industrials rose 284.46, or 3.05 percent, to 9,608.00, the first time since the Sept. 11 attacks that the average had closed above its Sept. 10 finish of 9,605.51. The Nasdaq composite index rose 82.75, or 4.74 percent, to 1,828.48. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 36.21, or 3.34 percent, to 1,120.31. Both the Nasdaq and S.& P. indexes regained their pre-attack levels in October. MICHAEL BRICK

Dealings of Enron emerging

The Enron name may soon fade away, but the federal securities investigation that helped erode the energy giant's foundation is not over yet. 
The 3 1/2-week-old Securities and Exchange Commission probe into Enron Corp.'s finances is likely drawing closer to answering questions about complex partnerships that wiped out more than $1 billion in shareholder value and almost $600 million in profits.
SEC officials don't discuss their works in progress, but already the results are becoming clear. 
The company admitted that massive accounting errors over the past four years led it to overstate its profits and understate its debts, an admission that no doubt saved the company from some SEC penalties, say observers. 
And the company has gradually distanced itself from its former chief financial officer - considered the architect behind some of the deals - and indicated that other employees were personally involved in the partnerships without its knowledge. But the culpability of Enron's current or former employees, if any, won't be clear for some time. 
On Oct. 17, the day after Enron reported an unexpected third- quarter loss, the SEC began asking Enron questions about two off- balance-sheet partnerships, called LJM1 and LJM2. They were formed to help the company grow without adding additional debt or diluting stock valuations, and were also used to help hedge against the risks in some of Enron's newer lines of business. 
Former CFO Andy Fastow formed the partnerships with the approval of the company's board of directors, attorneys and auditors. His dual role as CFO and managing partner of those two partnerships had the appearance of a conflict of interest, even though Enron insisted that measures were taken to prevent any illegal or unethical behavior. 
The SEC's role in looking at the partnerships isn't to prevent company executives from having conflicts of interest in their dealings, however, but rather to make sure the companies fully disclose those conflicts or any situations that may appear to be conflicts, said John Coates, a professor at Harvard Law school. 
"So although they have a role in determining that all the information in Enron's proxy was correct and that all transactions were reported, they were not responsible for determining whether or not the transactions were done on fair terms," Coates said. 
Item 404 of SEC Regulation S-K requires companies to disclose any transactions where executive officers personally benefit by $60,000 or more. That disclosure should include their direct and indirect interests in the deal, the amount of money or assets they receive through it and other information. 
As in all rules, however, there are certain exceptions. 
If an executive's compensation from a deal is less than 10 percent of the value of the overall transaction, they may not need to disclose all of those details, Coates said. That stipulation could possible give Enron cover for not having previously disclosed the $30 million Fastow earned through the partnerships. 
"But there are times when the companies may have followed the letter of the rules and the SEC still pushes them to fully disclose the details," he said. 
Whether or not Enron needed to disclose previously the investments or profits that a number of other employees made in some of the partnerships is also hard to discern. 
The company said this week that in addition to Fastow, five other employees invested in the deals. Two of those employees - Ben Glisan, a managing director and treasurer of Enron Corp., and Kristina Mordaunt, a managing director and general counsel of an Enron division - were terminated by Enron this week. The other employees, including Fastow and executives Michael Kopper, Kathy Lynn and Anne Yeager, no longer work for Enron. 
The company didn't mention how much those individuals invested or how much benefit, if any, they reaped from the deals. Some of the employees may not even fall under the disclosure rule since it doesn't give a clear definition of what positions are "executive officers." 
The company has gradually distanced itself from Fastow and the partnerships since the problems arose. Shortly after the earnings report last month Lay said he and the board stood by Fastow, but a day later replaced him. 
On Oct. 31, the day Enron said the SEC had upgraded its review of the finances from a simple inquiry to a formal investigation, the company announced that its board of directors had created a special investigation committee of its own. A company spokeswoman stressed that the committee had the power to take disciplinary action against any Enron employee, officer or director who it determines "improperly participated in the transactions." 
In its SEC filing that outlined the partnerships on Thursday, the company said it was aware of the partnerships but required that certain safeguards be put in place and that the transactions be approved and reviewed regularly. 
"Whether these controls and procedures were properly implemented is a subject of the Special Committee's investigation," the statement said. 
At a Friday news conference, Lay said the board was aware of the formation of one of the partnerships but that he was not aware that Glisan and Mordaunt were investing in the partnerships. Lay deflected many of the questions regarding the investigation, saying a conference call would be held next week. 
Shareholders have lined up behind lawsuits against the company, the partnerships, and even the company's law firm, Vinson & Elkins. 
"Disclosure cases and state corporate law cases are all but assured in situations like this," Coates said. "Even if the SEC does very little, the shareholders will still line up."

Demise of Enron a blow to city / As local business pillars crumble, Dynegy a bright spot

It seems like only days ago that Enron Corp. was being held up as an example of a company that could see the future. 
The wizards of Wall Street were marveling at the corporation's bold, innovative strategies.
In Houston, high-flying Enron was erecting its new headquarters downtown, a tall and shiny skyscraper, the city's first in more than a decade. 
And now, almost suddenly, Enron is vanishing. 
In the past few months, three pillars of Houston's economy and business leadership have fallen on hard times. Compaq Computer Corp., the centerpiece of Houston's technology image, may be sold. Continental Airlines has laid off thousands as it adjusts to a slowing economy and the aftermath of Sept. 11 in the travel business. 
And only months ago, Houston lost the headquarters of American General as the company was sold to American International Group. 
Now Enron will disappear as it is absorbed by one of its rivals. 
What impact does all of this negative business news have on Houston's image? 
The recent wave of corporate downturns has some experts concerned, but others say that when they look at the big picture they are still optimistic. 
"The fact we have had multiple blows has certainly had a negative effect in the short run," said Barton Smith, director of the Institute for Regional Forecasting at the University of Houston. 
But in the long run, Smith said, a city's future has more to do with its quality of life and the quality of its infrastructure than whether the city has lost or attracted a major headquarters. 
"When Boeing left Seattle, we said, `Poor Seattle,' " Smith said. "(Three months later) Seattle is still growing and still known as a good place to live." 
What is more important in terms of Houston's corporate image and its image in general, Smith said, is "whether it's easy to get around and get to work and how smoothly a businessman can get to Tokyo or London." 
Smith believes Houstonians should be more concerned about other local problems such as getting the city's pollution problem "under control in a rational way." If Houston continues to be known as one of the most polluted cities in America, Smith said, "that will continue to haunt us." 
The demise of Enron is "certainly not good news, nor was Compaq good news," said Steve Klineberg, a Rice University professor of sociology. 
The two companies enhanced the city's image and stature, Klineberg said, in that they signified that Houston was moving out of a 20th- century oil-based economy into a 21st-century economy based on information and technology. 
In terms of image, the Enron news is more damaging within the business community than to the perception of Houston by the world at large, said Steve Currall, associate professor of management psychology and statistics at the Jesse H. Jones Graduate School of Management at Rice University. 
"Enron has very little business-to-consumer activity, and for the average person on the street" it doesn't mean much, he said. 
But it is significant to the business community, Currall said. Enron has been a Fortune 10 company and consistently ranked as one of the most innovative companies in America. "And I think the struggles of Enron (have) a negative impact" in the business community, he said. 
"Houston has benefited from a company like Enron, which has made the city a world headquarters for energy trading," Currall said. "It made us a hub for the development of financial management innovations. 
"It's part of the reason why Enron and Dynegy resonate with the Wall Street gang. They say, `That trading stuff down there is cool.' It's the convergence of highly sophisticated finance and the energy industry." 
Currall said he is delighted that Dynegy is Enron's "suitor" because it keeps the people and operations in Houston. 
"That's great news for Houston," he said. 
Others agreed that the presence of Dynegy in Houston will soften the blow. 
Enron being bought by Dynegy, another Houston firm, is "like a couple of cousins getting together," said Barry Silverman, a marketing and management consultant. 
"In a sense, there is no loss for Houston," said David Crossley, president of the Gulf Coast Institute, a nonprofit group that promotes quality-of-life issues in the area. 
"Who would have thought that a company in Houston was capable of buying Enron?" Crossley said. It makes Dynegy a bigger company and, he said, creates a certain mystique about Houston since both cutting- edge businesses are here. 
David Morris, the managing partner of the Houston office of Heidrick & Struggles, an executive recruiting firm, believes that Houston has been unfairly stereotyped as having a "gunslinger" style of business environment, and he is concerned that "what's perceived as a gunslinging type of accounting at Enron will be underscored once again." 
But what should really be emphasized, Morris said, is Houston's creativity. 
"That Enron took an old-line industry of gas transmission and re- created it into the marketing of gas and trading of gas and hedging of the price for gas - creating different value streams in the same industry - and did it before the rest of the world could grasp it all is pretty amazing, and none of that is going away," he said. 
That point was echoed by Don Henderson, vice president and managing director of Hyatt Regency, Houston, and the recent chairman of the Greater Houston Convention and Visitors Bureau. 
"When you think of New York, you think of the stock market," he said, "and when you think of Chicago, you think of agribusiness. 
"And more and more when you think of Houston, it's energy as a commodity. And it's only going to be stronger with all the mergers and acquisitions because the business of trading energy as a commodity is only going to grow." 
Henderson maintained that Houston is still the envy of much of the country. 
Houston has always been one of the continuously booming economies, he said, and "has bounced back quicker and stronger than any region." 
To offer an example of the city's resilience and appeal, Henderson noted that Hewlett-Packard Chief Executive Officer Carly Fiorina recently stated that the work force of Compaq's Houston campus might increase in size in part because of the city's business-friendly environment compared to what she described as a less friendly business climate in California. 
Silverman maintained that the recent experiences of various local businesses "won't hurt our image at all." 
"In this global economy, you often see companies changing names and headquarters," he said. "It's like a Monopoly game. 
"I bet if I asked 100 people where Microsoft is headquartered, 50 of them couldn't tell me."

FLYING BLIND / By keeping investors in the dark, Enron lost its way

(Copyright 2001)

Last spring, Enron Chairman Ken Lay told a leadership forum at the University of Houston that his goal was to make Enron the No. 1 company in the world. Six months later, Enron was fighting for its life. In a $7.8 billion stock deal struck Friday, Enron will cease to exist as its operations are folded into rival Houston energy firm Dynegy. 
Enron, in recent years one of Houston's most important corporations, did not reach this pass because its ambitions were too high. Unlike the mythical Icarus, Enron did not fly too near the sun, melting the wax of its wings.
Enron's troubles came because some of its top executives chose to do much of their piloting under cover of darkness. In the process, they lost their way. 
By using several mysterious partnerships to finance projects and shield risk and debt from public scrutiny, Enron's leaders set the stage for the vicious circle in which drops in earnings and investor confidence and creditworthiness followed and exacerbated one another. The deals became so complicated and impenetrable that Enron's directors, who approved them, no longer knew whether the company's revenues and assets were coming or going. 
The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating Enron's financial arrangements and questionable bookkeeping, and an Enron spokesman says the company now finds it difficult to know the state of the partnerships it owned or controlled. Following months during which Enron's announcements regarding departing executives lacked both accuracy and candor, the company this past week restated its finances back to 1997, subtracting $586 million from its net income and adding $2.5 billion to its debt. Regardless of what the SEC inquiry finds, Enron's revised accounting makes a good case for congressional or regulatory elimination of whatever loopholes allowed Enron to inflate its income and obscure its debt. 
Enron officials say a special board committee is investigating the financial arrangements between former Enron executives and the obscure investment partnerships they managed or controlled. An Enron spokesman said the committee would make public its findings "at an appropriate time." The appropriateness of that time diminishes the further it gets from the present. 
Neither Enron officials nor investors need to wait for the committee's report to conclude that letting executives profit on the side from the partnerships while sticking stockholders with the liabilities was inappropriate. For the sake of Enron, its stockholders and the citizens of Houston, who depend on Enron's contribution to the economy and the civic life of the city, that arrangement must not be repeated. 
Much of Enron's problems stem from straightforward but imprudent or ill-timed investments: a power plant in India, broadband capacity not needed in a collapsing telecommunications market, and a doomed venture into the water business - Azurix Corp. 
Those losses might have been survivable, had Enron not denied its own transactions the transparency it sought for global energy markets.

Deregulation Not Derailed by California's Meltdown Power: Though many energy firms were scarred in the state's free-market stumble, analysts say they are likely to rebound.

Branded as lawless cowboys by California politicians and consumer advocates, energy merchants rode skyrocketing electricity and natural gas prices to new stock highs during the worst of California's energy crisis. 
But in recent months these energy companies--names such as Duke, Dynegy, Reliant, AES, Mirant, Williams and El Paso Corp.--have seen their fortunes dim as California's electricity meltdown has slowed the pace of deregulation nationwide, power prices have tumbled and the economy has faltered.
Even power plant owners and energy trading operations that have maintained healthy earnings growth have watched their stock performance fade. 
And then there's the Enron Effect. 
Enron Corp., cast as the heavy by California politicians, has suffered the biggest fall of all and has helped to drag down stocks of other energy producers and traders. 
Enron's woes appear to be a special case in that they flow less from its energy businesses than from a loss of investor confidence in the company's complex and shadowy financial structure, with a resulting cash crunch. 
Nonetheless, Enron's detractors are crowing at the rapid decline of the truest believer in electricity deregulation, the movement to take businesses controlled for decades by monopoly utilities and throw open the generation, trading and retail sale of electricity to new competitors. 
But just as Enron is not dead, neither is electricity deregulation, energy experts contend. Though several states have delayed their deregulation plans and some major corporate players are tempering their enthusiasm, other states and corporations press ahead. 
It's a tough new world for energy companies that will bring profit opportunities for some and acquisitions of low-priced players, analysts say. Enron, once the most brash of the energy peddlers, has agreed to be acquired by archrival Dynegy Inc. in a $7.7-billion stock deal. 
Yet when the economy and power prices improve, energy companies will see their prospects gleam again, analysts say. 
"Deregulation is a train that's not going to be derailed. It may be delayed, but it's coming," said Jon Kyle Cartwright, senior energy analyst with brokerage firm Raymond James & Associates. 
"When the economy rebounds, we're going to see higher energy prices again," Cartwright said. "That means that the guys who sell power, the guys who manufacture power--they're going to have very bright futures." 
Less than a year ago, when energy prices were headed for record territory in California and a winter of electricity shortages plagued the state, the favorite whipping boys of Gov. Gray Davis and other politicians were such energy sellers as Enron, AES Corp., Dynegy, Duke Energy Corp., Reliant Energy Inc., Mirant Corp., Williams Cos. and El Paso Corp. 
All are energy companies that own power plants in California or sell electricity or natural gas in the state at prices deemed by state officials to be higher than those a truly competitive market would have produced. The energy companies have denied that they overcharged Californians, and federal regulators investigating the matter have so far ordered only limited refunds of electricity revenues. 
Nonetheless, Southern California Edison Co. and Pacific Gas & Electric Co. lost so much money paying for electricity--costs they could not pass on to customers because of a rate freeze--that they became insolvent. PG&E filed for bankruptcy protection. 
California's near-death experience in electricity markets brought state government into the power business in unanticipated ways when lawmakers passed the landmark deregulation bill in 1996. 
The state became the primary electricity buyer for the big utilities' customers and formed a power authority to build power plants and transmission lines, becoming potential competition to generation companies. State regulators blocked electricity sellers from signing up new retail customers, a program known as "direct access" that is one of the key components of electricity deregulation. 
Players Refocusing on Other Operations 
The energy spectacle in California caused several states to short-circuit deregulation plans or to take a much slower approach that could delay for years the opening of those markets to competition. 
Energy companies also are now contending with lower electricity prices, which have plummeted since the beginning of the year, thanks to lower natural gas prices and temperate weather. And volatility has nearly disappeared, thereby cutting profit potential for energy trading firms. 
The economic downturn will reduce demand for electricity, analysts said, which also will hurt earnings at a range of companies. 
The pain was apparent in third-quarter results. 
"After several quarters of across-the-board strong results, we are now in more of a winners-and-losers environment, as low commodity prices and a weak economy make conditions more difficult," Merrill Lynch energy analyst Steven Fleishman said in a recent note to clients. 
Some big and mid-size players have stumbled, and a few have slowed their headlong rush into unregulated businesses that had until recently held promise for these companies, many of them utilities that branched out. 
A prime example is AES, which generates electricity in California, across the nation and in 26 other countries. AES said third-quarter net income fell 98% because of a sharp drop in profit from its operations in Brazil and Britain. AES reduced its earnings estimates for the year and said it will refocus on its core energy business, look for divestiture opportunities and not invest in any more telecommunications businesses, dropping its hostile $1.37-billion bid last week to take over a Venezuelan telecom firm. 
Reliant Energy said its wholesale energy operation had a 15% drop in third-quarter operating income, blaming lower gas and power prices, plus legal and other costs related to the California electricity crisis. The company's European operations lost $5 million because of lower profit brought about by deregulation in the Netherlands, and Reliant now is considering selling its European businesses. 
Constellation Energy Group, which owns the utility in Baltimore and is building power plants in California and around the country, abandoned plans to spin off its trading operation after it said earnings for the year will come in at the low end of estimates. 
One California firm that appeared poised to benefit from electricity shortages was Chatsworth-based Capstone Turbine Corp., which manufactures micro-turbines that supply power to a small business or a cluster of homes. 
But struggling Capstone said third-quarter revenue dropped by nearly half and its net loss widened by 54% to $12.5 million as California dodged a summer of blackouts and the economy slowed. 
Energy Giant Takes an Unexpected Loss 
The company hired a new chief operating officer and said it would restructure and lay off an undisclosed number of employees. 
The biggest surprise came from Enron, which broke a run of 16 profitable quarters, reporting a $635-million net loss for the third quarter because of a $1-billion charge from failed investments in water and telecommunications. The Houston-based energy giant also revealed that two of its off-balance-sheet investment partnerships, headed until July by its chief financial officer, led to $35million of the losses and chipped $1.2billion off shareholder equity in the third quarter. 
Investors began this month to dump the stock, and Enron's credit rating eroded amid lawsuits, news of a probe by the Securities and Exchange Commission into conflicts of interest and attempts by management to soothe fears. 
Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, who ran the two partnerships, was pushed out and the firm lined up new financing and went looking for new investors. 
Enron has used an opaque grid of off-balance-sheet partnerships to shelter assets and debt to help the company's push into a variety of deregulated markets in recent years. But analysts and investors fear that Enron is hiding money-losing assets in the partnerships; management has been tight-lipped about the purpose and holdings of the investment vehicles. 
Takeover rumors swirled last week around Enron before Dynegy announced the deal Friday, underscoring predictions of general industry consolidation because of low stock prices. 
Some Firms Thriving, but Not Their Stocks 
Some companies are still going strong, although their stocks remain depressed. 
That includes companies on the receiving end of potshots from California's politicians and utility regulators such as Duke Energy, Dynegy, Mirant, NRG Corp. and Williams, as well as San Jose-based Calpine Corp., which was repeatedly praised by Davis for playing a constructive role during the crisis. 
Calpine, for instance, said third-quarter profit and revenue doubled because the electricity producer increased sales by adding power plants. And yet its stock is down 55% from a 52-week high of $58 reached in March. 
"These are the energy merchants that seem to have the best grasp on the market and on risk management," said Chris Ellinghaus, power and natural gas analyst with Williams Capital in New York. Many of these companies are diversified geographically and by the fuel they use to generate electricity and had locked in favorable contracts that protected them when power prices fell this summer, he said. 
ABN Amro utility analyst Paul Patterson said investors have turned away from these companies, even the healthy ones, because the business "isn't as exciting as it used to be." 
"People go on earnings momentum. It's kind of like having your dessert first," Patterson said. "Once the best is over, you lose your appetite." 
One company trying to adapt to deregulation's devolution in California is Commonwealth Energy Corp., which has survived a run-in with the California Public Utilities Commission and the suspension in California of direct access, Commonwealth's primary business of selling electricity directly to consumers and businesses. 
Commonwealth Energy was one of the more than 300 companies that flocked to California to sell retail electricity to the customers of Southern California Edison, PG&E and San Diego Gas & Electric Co. All but about a dozen of the electricity sellers failed, and Commonwealth enjoyed initial success peddling low-priced power from renewable sources. 
But the Tustin-based company and its founder, Fred Bloom, ran afoul of the PUC for faulty billing practices and Bloom's failure to disclose that he had been ordered to stop selling unregistered securities by five states. 
Commonwealth Energy settled the matter by paying about $350,000 and reimbursing customers. Bloom was banished from the firm as part of the settlement, and an all-new management team set about diversifying away from deregulated businesses, said Ian Carter, the company's chairman and chief executive. 
The firm, which recently became registered as a public company but can't sell stock until January, is earning a profit, largely because it has been able to resell contracted energy for more than it paid. 
To maintain its growth, the company is turning away from deregulation and toward providing back-office services for regulated companies, generators and municipalities, Carter said. 
For the fiscal year ended July 31, Commonwealth Energy posted revenue of $183 million, up 84%, and income of $60.5 million, compared with a loss of $8.6 million in the previous fiscal year. 
"We certainly don't consider ourselves a casualty of deregulation or direct access," Carter said, noting that the company still sells electricity to 55,000 California business and residential customers and to cities, including Santa Monica and Palmdale. 
"We realized that we needed to diversify and we needed to do that fairly quickly," Carter said. The company has nearly 40,000 retail customers in Pennsylvania and will be entering Texas, Michigan, New Jersey and Ohio, he said. 
Seven states have delayed their push toward open markets, and some of those that remain on track, such as Texas, have run into unforeseen glitches that delay the process of giving electricity customers choices beyond their traditional utilities. 
Deregulation marches on in power trading and generation. 
The Electric Power Supply Assn., a Washington-based trade group, said last week that competitive power supplies account for slightly more than a third of the nation's generation capacity, up from 8.5% in 1997. Wholesale power trading could approach 7 billion megawatt-hours this year, up from 2.6 billion in 1999, the group said. 
Federal regulators are in the middle of determining how to reallocate control of electricity transmission lines into only a few regional operators, perhaps owned by new for-profit companies other than utilities. 
This process shows that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission remains determined to open electricity markets despite the problems in California, said Lawrence J. Makovich, senior director of the North American power practice at Cambridge Energy Research Associates. 
"We've got major parts of the electricity business moving backward, and California is the prime example," Makovich said. "But when you look at other places in the country, what you see is a continuing evolution to a much more market-based power situation." 
David Jermain, a principal in the national utility practice of Andersen LLP, said California will remain on the sidelines for years, paying higher prices than those produced by competitive markets. It also must contend with a number of pending lawsuits. 
"California is in for a long-term state of chaotic confusion," Jermain said. "It's such a complicated mess that you're going to have to let the court system play through."

The Thing Is: Enron

11/11/2001
The Independent - London
FINAL

(Copyright 2001 Independent Newspapers (UK) Limited)

To investors who thought utilities were a slow but steady way to watch their money grow, Enron tells a particularly chilling tale of horror. 
Even Friday's news that Enron's much smaller Houston neighbour, Dynergy, may be preparing to mount a $7bn (pounds 5bn) cash and stock bid did not mask the grisly truth. As far as US fund managers are concerned, this is a company that let Wall Street down spectacularly. Dynergy is thought to have waited until then to be sure Moody's did not downgrade Enron's investment grade to junk status.
The misery is doubled by the tempting image of what Enron could have been. At their peak almost a year ago, the shares gave the company a market value of $69bn; on Friday they were worth a tenth of that. 
The market felt there was good reason to push the stock to those heights. Here was a company that had, for many years, appeared to make all the right moves. As the group transformed itself from a dull utility into an exciting mix of energy trading, communications and services, it seemed never to put a foot wrong. "You had such an outstanding and arrogant company," said Roger Hamilton, a senior fund manager at John Hancock, "They were the giant. Everything in the energy industry touched Enron." 
The company even managed to persuade investors its convoluted management structure, which some believe is the root cause of its demise, was a positive thing. "You can't kiss the ass of 24 people," said former Enron chairman Jeffrey Skilling. "And together those 24 people are more likely to have the interests of the shareholders at heart than any one person." 
Unfortunately, behind the scenes, all hell was breaking loose. The last couple of months have given the market a long, embarrassing string of revelations about the company it once cherished. The company has $13bn of outstanding debt, and has found its access to funds extremely limited. Two weeks ago, as a measure of its desperation, Enron had to secure a rescue loan against its 25,000- mile network of gas pipelines. Along the way, details of the group's botched expansion into India have made for supremely depressing reflections on management. Crowning the whole sorry tale, and driving the shares down 80 per cent, was the opening last month of a Securities and Exchange Commission probe into the accounting for some of Enron's partnerships. Last week came the sacking of the group's treasurer and corporate lawyer, and a revision of earnings for the last four years to the tune of half-a-billion dollars. 
Despite it all, Dynergy's bid could be the steal of the century. Until all its troubles are out in the open, Enron may be just a little too grimy for many potential buyers. But even the most bearish analysts can see there are rich pickings from the old Enron empire. Dynergy's big problem is snapping them up before the big boys, including Chevron or Shell, poach the good stuff.

USA: Wall Street takes aim at accounting tricks.
By Deepa Babington

11/11/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Nov 11 (Reuters) - Wall Street is starting to refuse to bite the bait on dubious earnings numbers highlighted by corporations in press releases. 
Companies tout profit figures, frequently called pro forma results, that strip out unseemly one-time charges and expenses at record levels - more than $200 billion this year alone. Investors, analysts, and accountants are revolting, and pressure is building to do away with the medley of different profit numbers or at least cut down on it.
Standard & Poor's, a major compiler of earnings and other financial data, now will treat restructuring charges, stock option expenses, and write-downs from ongoing operations as part of a company's operating earnings - items that many companies exclude from their version of operating earnings. 
"In the past, S&P would take a company's special charges at their word," said S&P analyst Robert Friedman, who was involved in the project. "But now we're going to say, 'Hey, wait a minute.'" 
The decision underscores the momentum building on Wall Street to scrutinize corporate accounting. One recent high-profile victim of this movement was Enron Corp. The energy trading company faced a crisis in investor confidence after it became clear it had boosted profits and racked up debt through complex financial transactions known as off-balance sheet deals. 
The deals, which were structured so they wouldn't show up on Enron's balance sheet, caused Enron to chop almost $600 million off earnings for the last four years. The once-mighty company lost $20 billion in market value, and on Friday agreed to be bought by smaller rival Dynegy Inc. 
Investors are scared of such stock market casualties. That's partly why they want to crack down on pro-forma numbers, which often present a much rosier picture of a company's performance because they exclude a whole bevy of costs that drag down the bottom line. 
"Hopefully, this will put pressure on companies to think twice when they put out their financials," said Friedman. 
Tech companies, in particular, conveniently have stripped out everything from inventory write-downs to severance costs from their bottom-line figures and pressured analysts to do the same with their earnings estimates. 
Mobile phone maker Motorola Inc. , for example, reported a third-quarter pro forma loss of $153 million early last month. After including charges for investment impairments, cost reduction activities and additional reserves for its financing of a Turkish cellular operator, however, the company posted a whopping $1.4 billion loss. 
A Motorola spokesman was not available for comment. 
The practice has also made it difficult for analysts and investors to compare the results of one company against its peers as each comes up with its own ideas of what should be included in pro forma earnings. 
"There are so many variants of pro forma that it can cloud comparisons," said David Zion, an accounting analyst at Bear Stearns. 
The proliferation of these reports has also caught the attention of the nation's accounting rule makers, even though they don't have the authority to police press releases. 
The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) two weeks ago said it is pressing ahead with a project that will look at how some closely watched items such as pension fund income should be classified and presented in financial statements. 
Corporate America was not enthused by the idea and several corporations wrote to the accounting body urging it not to go ahead with the plan, said the project's senior manager, Ronald Bossio. 
But fund managers and investors are applauding. 
In a survey of 223 portfolio managers by capital markets firm Broadgate Consultants, nine out of 10 stock pickers said companies need to improve how they report results. FASB needs to come up with one key indicator of financial performance, and companies should abide by it, they basically said. 
If the accounting rule-making body accepted EBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as a key measure, companies ought to calculate it in a consistent manner and display it as a separate item on their statements, almost all managers agreed. 
"I think that pro forma thing is just a way to get around Generally Accepted Accounting Principles," said Debra McNeill, a portfolio manager at Fremont Investment Advisors. "I think there needs to be some guidelines to be set out on pro forma numbers, but it does not necessarily need to be banned.

Senate stimulus bill slammed as grab bag of special interests
JANET HOOK
Los Angeles Times

Houston Chronicle

WASHINGTON - Watermelon growers. Filmmakers. Owners of electric cars. Commuters in northern New Jersey. Those are among the people who would benefit from the fine print of a bill, in the Senate on Friday, to boost the languishing U.S. economy. 
The bill, on which a vote is expected this week, would pour about $70 billion into the economy next year, mostly for extended unemployment benefits, health insurance subsidies and tax breaks for individuals and businesses.
But it also includes a panoply of provisions less obviously connected to stimulating the economy - and more clearly designed to win support from specific senators. 
In a last-minute concession to Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., the bill includes bonding authority for Amtrak to develop high-speed railroads and for a new New York-New Jersey tunnel. More than $5 billion in agriculture subsidies were grafted on to help shore up support of farm-state members. 
The Senate Finance Committee approved the bill Thursday night on a party-line vote, but only after Republicans spent hours slamming it as a hodgepodge of special-interest favors that will do little to strengthen the economy. 
"This is a collage of political giveaways," said Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas. 
Sound familiar? That's because Democrats mounted a similar critique of the bill approved by the Republican-controlled House two weeks ago. Democrats argued that the House's $100 billion tax cut bill primarily would benefit some of the biggest corporations in America, including Houston-based Enron Corp. Rep. Martin Frost, D- Dallas, called it a "grab bag of special-interest goodies." 
The mudslinging on both sides illustrates a new line of argument that crops up in debates all over Capitol Hill these days: The best way to attack your opponents is to accuse them of trying to capitalize on the post-Sept. 11 sense of crisis to advance a parochial political agenda. 
Sometimes the critique boomerangs. Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla., a member of the House Republican leadership, issued a statement Thursday attacking the Senate Democrats' bill, saying, "The Senate's economic proposal focuses more on the excise tax for rum and other special-interest breaks than creating jobs." 
He was referring to a Senate provision that would extend for one year an existing provision affecting rum imports. The problem with his argument, however, is that the same provision is in the House Republican bill - which Watts supported. 
That's just one of many provisions in both the House Republican and Senate Democratic bills that have little connection to economic stimulus; instead, they extend a slew of tax breaks, routinely approved by Congress, which are about to expire. 
At the White House, spokesman Ari Fleischer said the Senate bill contained "too much spending and not enough stimulus." He lambasted the $220 million in the bill for bison meat, eggplant, cauliflower and pumpkin growers - in essence, a government subsidy for commodities that have "experienced low prices during the 2000 or 2001 crop years." Thirty-four commodities would qualify. 
But Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus, D-Mont., said aid for the ailing agricultural sector is an appropriate element of a recovery plan. 
"When our national economy declines, rural areas are often among the areas that are hit the hardest and that recover slowest," Baucus said. 
Another industry that could benefit from the Senate bill is the motion picture industry. Like the House bill, the Senate bill allows businesses more quickly to write off their investments in assets whose value depreciates over a number of years. But unlike the House legislation, the Senate bill includes a provision specifying that films are a depreciable asset qualifying for the tax break.

The State Will Pay for Davis' Panic

BYLINE: KATHLEEN CONNELL, PETER NAVARRO, Kathleen Connell is California state
controller. Peter Navarro is, an associate professor of economics and public
policy at UC Irvine

BODY:

??The five-to-20-year power contracts signed in a panic by the Davis
administration have saddled California with billions of dollars of "stranded
costs" that will burden our economy and state budget for years to come.

??Now, Gov. Gray Davis' spin doctors want us to believe that these $43-billion
long-term contracts were both necessary and the impetus for a moderating 
energy
market. Here's the real story:

??Last summer, under a flawed deregulation, a handful of large out-of-state
generators effectively cornered California's wholesale electricity market. 
This
"sellers cartel" first drained our electric utilities dry. In November, it
became the taxpayers' turn to be victimized, when the Davis administration 
gave
carte blanche authority to the Department of Water Resources for energy
purchases. Between November and July, the department burned through $8 billion
in short-term energy purchases, devouring almost the entire state budget
surplus. This required the state Public Utilities Commission to pass the 
largest
rate hike in California history and will require the state to issue $12.4
billion in bonds this fall to service this debt.

??In February, with spot market prices at all-time highs and rolling blackouts
rippling through the state, the governor's representatives began to negotiate
long-term contracts with the sellers cartel. This was an ill-advised long-term
strategy to fight a short-run crisis. To understand why, look at the 
negotiating
chessboard from the electricity cartel's perspective. The cartel's negotiators
knew that within 18 to 24 months, there would be a huge glut of power on the
market as many power plants were already under construction in California and
throughout the West. Once the new energy resources were available, the cartel
would no longer be able to manipulate the market. This supply glut would drive
prices back to the 1999 range of three to five cents per kilowatt-hour, far
lower than the prices now set in the long-term energy contracts.

??To the cartel members, this looming power glut was a recipe for heavy 
losses.
Locking the state into long-term contracts at lucrative rates was their
redemption. The Davis administration walked into this market inferno, 
bargaining
from extreme weakness at the top of the market, signing contracts that were 
too
expensive. The administration also capitulated on two highly objectionable
clauses. The first requires the state to absorb all costs of environmental
protection for many of the generators. The second holds the generators
"harmless" for any increase in taxes imposed on the generators by the state.
This provision essentially freezes taxes on the generators over the next 
several
years, requiring taxpayers to pick up the tab.

??Notwithstanding the administration's spin, the current improvement in our
energy situation may be traced to at least four other factors: This summer has
been unusually cool, Californians have increased their conservation,
recessionary forces have reduced demand and, most important, the Federal 
Energy
Regulatory Commission finally imposed price caps on the sellers cartel,
dampening market manipulation.

??The bottom line is this: Long after the rolling blackouts stop, California 
still will be saddled with billions of dollars of unnecessary electricity 
costs
and high bond debt. These higher costs will hurt consumers and businesses, put
heavy pressure on the state budget for years and inhibit the state's economic
growth.

??There are two lessons from this multibillion-dollar mistake. The first is to
have full public review of major energy decisions. Equally important, the 
Public
Utilities Commission must be allowed to retain its rate-making authority so 
that
problems are not hidden in a state bureaucracy.

Davis' Energy Advisors Draw SEC Attention;
Probe: Under review is the possible use of inside information to buy power
company stocks. GOP rival of governor requested the inquiry.

BYLINE: WALTER HAMILTON JEFFERY L. RABIN, DARYL KELLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS

BODY:

??The Securities and Exchange Commission has launched a preliminary inquiry
into whether energy consultants advising Gov. Gray Davis used inside 
information
to trade stocks of power companies doing business with the state, a source 
with
knowledge of the matter said Monday.

??The federal agency began its review late last week, the source said, in
response to a request from California Secretary of State Bill Jones. A
Republican rival of Davis, Jones charged that stock trading by consultants may
have violated federal laws barring buying and selling based on information not
available to the public.

??On Friday, top aides to the governor disclosed that five consultants had 
been
fired for possible conflicts of interest between their official positions and
their personal finances.

??As news of the SEC inquiry spread through the capital Monday, Davis 
officials
were confronted by a flurry of questions about who in the administration owns
energy stocks.

??Financial disclosure records filed by the governor's spokesman, Steve
Maviglio, show that he owns between $10,000 and $100,000 in a Texas company he
and his boss have accused of making "obscene" profits while California has 
been
"on its knees." Maviglio said he bought the shares in Houston-based Enron 
Corp.
in 1996.

??"It's not a crime to own energy stock," Maviglio said.

??He also owns 300 shares of San Jose-based Calpine Corp., which has the
largest share of the $43 billion in long-term state power contracts.

??Maviglio placed the order for the stock on May 31, one day after San Jose's
mayor dropped his opposition to a controversial Calpine plant favored by the
governor and others. Under the terms of Maviglio's purchase, the transaction 
was
completed about three weeks later when the stock reached $40 a share, a value 
of
$12,000. It has since fallen in value.

??"I viewed it as a good long-term investment," Maviglio said, adding that he
purchased the shares for his retirement account based on publicly available
information.

??The Davis administration has spared Calpine the kind of fierce criticisms
that it has leveled at other electricity suppliers, such as Enron. But
California's grid operator has identified the company as one of many energy
merchants to overcharge the state millions of dollars.

??The fired consultants also owned shares in Calpine, ranging in value from
several thousand dollars to more than $100,000, records show.

??Another top Davis administration official, legal affairs secretary Barry
Goode, disclosed in his economic interest statement that he recently held
between $100,000 and $1 million in another out-of-state company accused of
multimillion-dollar price gouging.

??In a statement, Goode said he sold his stock in Williams Co's. a month after
he began working for the governor in February. Goode said the shares were
supposed to be sold before he went on the state payroll, but his broker failed
to do so.

??In light of the recent disclosures, Secretary of State Jones said the
governor must do more to ensure the public that its interest comes first.

??"The governor should direct all of his staff to immediately file updated
conflict of interest statements that reflect current holdings and any activity
since their last statement of economic interest was filed," said Jones, who is
seeking the GOP nomination for governor.

??Word of the SEC's entry into California's energy problems comes as the
governor faces harsh criticism from lawmakers and others for the quick and 
broad
hiring of highly paid private consultants to guide him through the crisis.

??In his written request to the SEC, Jones said that recently filed disclosure
documents showed that at least one consultant bought and sold shares of two
energy companies within the same month, raising "a red flag" about the
possibility of insider trading.

??State law prohibits officials from participating in decisions involving 
their
personal financial interests.

??The five consultants fired last week were among 11 named in Jones' letter,
delivered to the San Francisco office of the SEC last Wednesday. It was not
clear which individuals are the focus of the SEC's inquiry, or whether the
agency's review would result in any charges.

??Two of the former traders said Monday that they had not been contacted by
federal investigators and knew nothing of an inquiry into possible insider
trading.

??But William Mead, fired Thursday, said it is no mystery why so many of his
colleagues owned Calpine stock.

??Mead said he bought it 2 1/2 years ago and made so much money he recommended
it to his colleagues last year, while they all still worked for the 
now-defunct
California Power Exchange in Alhambra. Calpine power was not traded on that
exchange, so there was no conflict of interest, he said.

??Mead and three other energy traders--hired by the state in February and
March--were terminated by the Davis administration for allegedly buying power
for the state from Calpine while owning the company's stock. Fired traders
Herman Leung, Peggy Cheng and Constantine Louie did not list the date of their
Calpine purchases on financial statements that the state required to be filed
only two weeks ago.

??"But I'm sure they bought it while they were still at the power exchange,
because that's when we discussed it," Mead said. "It was kind of like a hobby.
I'm sure it wasn't done with the intent to manipulate."

??Former trader Elaine Griffin, who also owned Calpine stock and resigned two
weeks ago to take another job, said she didn't know she owned energy 
securities
until she checked with her financial advisor July 13, just before leaving her
state job.

??Griffin said she and her husband own about $10,000 worth of Calpine stock in
individual retirement accounts managed by their advisor, who bought the stock
Feb. 1 without their knowledge, she said, after research found it to be a good
investment.

??"I kind of feel like we've been used for political reasons," Griffin said.
"We would have disclosed anything right at first, but they never asked."

??As a trader, Griffin said she occasionally bought Calpine power for the
state, but only at market prices.

??Meanwhile, two Democratic political consultants, who helped Davis polish his
image after the ongoing energy crisis caused his poll numbers to plummet, have
agreed to accept no payment for their work as part of an out-of-court 
settlement
of a taxpayer lawsuit.

??Tom Hiltachk, a lawyer for conservative anti-tax activist Lewis Uhler, said
the settlement was reached last Friday after negotiations with lawyers for
communications consultants Mark Fabiani and Chris Lehane.

??"Now they will not receive one red cent," said Hiltachk. "Very simply Mr.
Fabiani and Mr. Lehane have agreed to cease all activities for the governor, 
to
accept no payments for their services and to basically get out of the 
consulting
business with the governor."

??As his part of the agreement, Hiltachk said, Uhler withdrew his lawsuit
Monday morning.

??Uhler had filed a lawsuit against the two consultants and Controller 
Kathleen
Connell in June contending that they should not receive any payments because 
of
a conflict of interest. The two men also did consulting work for financially
troubled Southern California Edison, which was seeking help from Davis and the
Legislature.

??Connell, a former Los Angeles mayoral candidate who has been at odds with
Davis since he endorsed an opponent, had held up the payments pending the
outcome of the lawsuit.

??Under an agreement with Davis, the men were to have been paid $30,000 a 
month
for six months.

??Fabiani and Lehane could not be reached for comment.

HEADLINE: Gray Davis' Edison problem

BYLINE: By William Bradley

HIGHLIGHT:
The governor struggles to orchestrate a multimillion-dollar bailout of the
utility that has spent big bucks on his campaign.

BODY:

??Ever since his January State of the State address, in which he dwelled on 
the
state's power crisis but neglected to mention private utilities' central role 
in
devising the deregulation scheme that caused it, California Gov. Gray Davis 
has
been searching for a way to bail out the insolvent Southern California Edison,
which has contributed more than $350,000 to Davis' campaign coffers. Now his
drive to save the battered utility, which claims nearly $4 billion in debt and
is no longer creditworthy enough to buy power, has gone into overtime, with no
solution yet in sight. An attempt to bring the California Assembly back from 
its
summer recess to vote on a new bailout bill Friday was just the latest such
effort to fall apart.

??The drive to bail out Edison, one of the biggest proposed corporate rescues
in U.S. history, remains very troubled, despite a flurry of high-level 
activity
over the past two weeks. The Aug. 15 deadline for legislative approval of some
semblance of the very sweet deal negotiated last spring by Davis looms, yet 
the
California Legislature is in recess until Aug. 20. One bill pronounced
unacceptable by Edison, backed by Senate President John Burton, the fiery San
Francisco liberal, and Sen. Byron Sher of Palo Alto, passed the Senate last 
week
before the Legislature went on recess.

??This bill would require Edison -- which lobbied through the disastrous
electric power deregulation scheme in 1996 and made billions in profits, which
were transferred to the utility's holding company, before being outmaneuvered 
by
the very firms to which it sold its power plants -- to eat more than a billion
dollars in losses. Not surprisingly, Davis and Edison preferred a more 
generous
bill by Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg of Los Angeles. But that bill, its fate
complicated by an even more straightforward bailout offered by another Los
Angeles Democrat, didn't make it through the Assembly.

??Hertzberg and Davis have just failed in a bid to bring the Assembly back 
into
session to pass another bailout bill, this one more generous than the 
Hertzberg
bill that stalled last week, omitting the state's acquisition of transmission
lines that would make the transaction a "buyout rather than a bailout," as the
governor's mantra went. The transmission lines are major strategic assets
affording the state more leverage over power generators, which is why their
acquisition by the state is opposed by the Bush-Cheney administration.

??The bailout is a huge priority for Davis, who has populated the top ranks of
his energy team with Edison alumni. Davis' new communications chief, former Al
Gore press secretary Chris Lehane (who had been working for an Edison bailout 
at
the same time he worked for the state, until the conflict-of-interest heat
finally got too hot), has said: "The governor and Edison have the same energy
policy" -- a striking point of view, and not at all inaccurate. But the 
original
Davis bailout plan -- negotiated, oddly, on behalf of the state by former
Southern California Edison president Michael Peevey -- received little support
beyond that of Edison and the Los Angeles Times, on whose board Edison
International chairman John Bryson, one of the principal backers of
deregulation, once sat. So Davis joined with Hertzberg for slightly tougher
versions of the original deal, only to see them languish, with only the
substantially tougher version backed by Burton, his frequent antagonist,
currently standing.

??Of the $1 million Davis raised from utilities and energy companies since he
started running for governor (he has stopped taking energy money), Edison has
provided by far the biggest chunk, over 35 percent. This is twice as much as
given by now bankrupt Pacific Gas & Electric, a larger company.

??The ties and tilt are obvious. Not only did Peevey head the
administration's negotiation with the utilities, but former Edison executive
Vikram Budhraja has a $6.2 million state contract to manage the state's $43
billion in long-term power contracts. And Davis officials were remarkably mum 
on
the woes of Edison's San Onofre nuclear power plant, one reactor of which was
offline for the first five months of the year, despite the fact that the
accident caused blackouts, raised serious questions about the company's
management and maintenance practices, and cost the state a billion dollars for
replacement power. These close ties have been pointed up by the governor's
hiring of two nationally prominent spin controllers, former top Clinton-Gore
operatives who helped Davis finally accede to the obvious and pound away at 
the
White House's dense web of connections to the energy industry. Ironically, 
their
hiring highlighted the dense web of connections between Davis and Edison.

??Lehane and Clinton damage control counsel Mark Fabiani played a major role 
in
implementing the new strategy of bashing Bush and Cheney. But the two brought 
an
enormous amount of controversy with them to their roles, both because of 
their $
30,000 monthly contract with the state and because they worked concurrently 
for
Edison. After some confusing reports several weeks ago suggesting that the duo
had dropped their work for Edison, Lehane brushed them aside and told me that,
yes, they were still working for Edison to gain a state bailout of the company
and that there was no conflict of interest there. "The governor and Edison," 
he
said, "have the same energy policy; there's no conflict in working for both."

??Finally recognizing that that comment was uncomfortably akin to another, 
more
hypothetical statement -- "The president and Enron have the same energy 
policy;
there's no conflict in working for both" -- Davis redefined his relationship
with the two.

??Davis let Fabiani go, retaining Lehane but cutting his pay by a third, and
requiring him to stop working for Edison. A seemingly fair result, though some
public interest advocates insist that state conflict-of-interest law prohibits
his employment in any event, pointing out that his work for Edison occurred
within the last year. Adding injury to insult, state controller Kathleen
Connell, a fellow Democrat who is sharply critical of Davis' handling of the
energy crisis, refuses to pay Lehane and Fabiani. ?Meanwhile, top Edison
officials said again last week that the utility will go bankrupt without a
bailout. Its parent company, Edison International, whose assets have been
shielded from the utility's woes after being boosted by transfers of billions
from the utility, just posted a big loss. Wall Street had expected a modest
profit.

??Despite the Assembly's failure to reconvene, bailout talks will continue
among an informal working group of top Davis officials, legislators, staffers
and lobbyists. Through the L.A. Times, Edison this week trumpeted its 
utility's
recently improved cash flow, which may well stave off moves by creditors to
force the utility into bankruptcy while the politicians try again to sort 
things
out.

??But the governor's close ties to Edison continue to rankle many in the
Capitol and elsewhere. Davis has long been aligned with Edison chieftain John
Bryson, who made his reputation as a pro-alternative energy Public Utilities
Commission president in the Jerry Brown administration before becoming a bete
noire to many environmentalists and renewable power advocates in his current
role.

??Consumer advocates, like deregulation opponent Harvey Rosenfield of the
Foundation for Taxpayer & Consumer Rights, oppose any bailout of the utility,
California's second largest, preferring that it join its larger cousin, 
Pacific
Gas & Electric, in bankruptcy. Rosenfield promises to mount an initiative
campaign to derail any bailout deal.

??Many legislators feel the same way, noting that the sky did not fall after
PG&E went bankrupt. Sen. Mike Machado, a conservative Central Valley Democrat,
says that bankruptcy court can do a better job of sorting out Edison's 
finances
than the Legislature. Some liberals privately disdain Edison for its role in
crafting the state's deregulation debacle. And Republican legislators are 
having
a field day sounding like consumer advocates.

??Notwithstanding the struggle over the fate of Edison, California is in 
better
shape than most feared a few months ago. Surprisingly mild weather 
(California's
hot summer has materialized in Japan, which just set a record for electric 
power
usage), coupled with increased conservation, power companies controlling
themselves to save deregulation and retain the credibility with a divided
federal government to enter lucrative new businesses, and federal restraint of
the most egregious price spikes have reduced an across-the-board calamity to a
mere multifaceted crisis.

??But Davis, who after a very slow start deserves credit for at least some of
the good news, is under fire for the huge long-term power contracts his
administration negotiated, which, after months of secrecy, turn out to be more
expensive than advertised and perpetrate a green blackout, ignoring renewable
energy in favor of fossil fuel generation. Not only do the contracts eschew
renewables, a number of them provide the actual financial underpinnings for a
new generation of fossil fuel plants, guaranteeing their profitability for the
companies developing them. A troubling result for the Democratic 
administration
of a state that by itself is the world's fifth-largest economy, especially at 
a
time when most of the rest of the world is criticizing the Republican
administration in Washington for refusing to deal with the greenhouse effect.

??Ironically, given all the furor over the Bush-Cheney energy plan, it is the
Davis plan that is actually furthering California's dependency on fossil 
fuels.
"The state's contracts are the biggest public power project in the country,"
notes Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies director John
White, "and yet they are a festival of fossil fuel development."

??Meanwhile, there has been no federal order of refunds for the astonishing
price run-up California has experienced over the past year. With refunds, the
state could bail out Edison and perhaps PG&E as well. But two weeks of
negotiations in Washington earlier this summer between state officials and 
power
generators went nowhere. Which is precisely where the Edison bailout remains.

HEADLINE: S.F. to vote on electric power to the people;

Measures would start public utility districts

SOURCE: Chronicle Staff Writer

BYLINE: Rachel Gordon

DATELINE: San Francisco

BODY:
After decades of trying to persuade San Francisco to take control of its
electrical system, advocates of public power now have the issue before city
voters.

???"The timing couldn't be better," said consumer advocate Medea Benjamin,
co-director of San Francisco's Global Exchange.

???"It's not just the threat of blackouts or the highest rate hikes in 
history.
It's the fact that PG&E is in bankruptcy. It's the depletion of the state
budget," she said. "This is a hell of an opportunity."

???The opportunity she is talking about centers on two November ballot 
measures
that would pave the way for creating a public power system and taking Pacific
Gas and Electric Co. out of the city's electricity market.

???Under the proposed measures, an elected board of directors would set the
rates and have control over everything from the terms for buying electricity 
to
whether to use more renewable energy sources, such as wind, hydroelectric and
solar power.

???Public power would base policies "on a more localized basis, where the
values of an individual community can be put into practice," said Ed Smeloff, 
a
longtime public power advocate who was recently hired as an assistant general
manager at the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission.

???One proposal, an initiative placed on the ballot by residents, calls for
setting up a municipal utility district in San Francisco and neighboring
Brisbane. The district would be governed by an elected board of directors.

???The other measure, placed on the ballot last week by the Board of
Supervisors, would create a municipal water and power agency and would affect
only San Francisco.

???PG&E has mounted a campaign to defeat the measures, so far pumping more 
than
$200,000 into the effort.

???"We think the (ballot proposals) are a bad idea," said Frank Gallagher,
spokesman for the Coalition for Affordable Public Services, the PG&E-financed
group fighting the measures. "They're confusing and do nothing to address the
problem."

???The company has a history of opposing public power proposals, derailing a
plan in Davis in the 1990s and using a legal challenge to stall the start of
Sacramento's Municipal Utility District for two decades.

???For years, private utilities have enjoyed a powerful hold on state and 
local
politicians. But the energy crisis has caused widespread public anger and
concern, forcing city and state officials to take another look at public 
power.

???A poll conducted this month by the Public Policy Institute of California, a
nonpartisan think tank in San Francisco, found that nearly two-thirds of
Californians support the replacement of private electric companies with
municipal power authorities formed by local governments.

???San Francisco already owns a power system, Hetch Hetchy, which provides
power for city departments. PG&E provides power to residents and businesses.

???The San Francisco Charter amendment placed on the ballot by the supervisors
calls for abolishing the city's existing Public Utilities Commission, which is
run by commissioners and a director appointed by the mayor. The proposed 
public
power board would have seven elected directors, but the agency still would
retain some ties to City Hall.

???The supervisors' plan is intended to be used as a backup to the municipal
utility district -- commonly known as a MUD -- which is considered to be more
vulnerable to the expected legal challenges from PG&E.

???"It's a great marriage, and will ensure that we get public power in San
Francisco," said Board of Supervisors President Tom Ammiano, chief sponsor of
the board's measure.

???San Francisco is not alone in looking at public power. San Diego, the first
city to feel the hard pinch of the energy crisis, wants to establish a 
regional
public power system in an attempt to pool resources and bring down energy 
costs.

???The East Bay Municipal Utility District, which provides water and sewer
service, is considering expanding its reach to power. In the Bay Area, the
cities of Alameda and Palo Alto already have public power. The two largest
public power agencies in the state serve Los Angeles and Sacramento.

???In San Francisco, the pro-public power forces are going to tout the 
promised
virtues of turning the electric utility over to a public authority that by law
cannot turn a profit. That, they contend, means lower rates.

???"It's an expectation, but it's also tried and true," said Ross Mirkarimi,
campaign director of MUD Now, the group sponsoring the ballot initiative.

???On average, consumers pay 18 percent less for power from public utilities,
he said.

???Gallagher, spokesman for the opposition campaign, said ratepayers shouldn't
assume that public power means lower energy bills. "There's no way the rates 
are
going down," he said.

???He blamed the energy crisis not on deregulation but on a shortage of
electricity, which jacked up prices and undercut reliability.

???"The measures do nothing about supply," Gallagher said. "All this will do 
is
cost people money. You can't just take PG&E's assets. You have to pay for 
them."

HEADLINE: Davis' top spokesman bought stock in power firm;

Adviser denies conflict of interest

SOURCE: Chronicle Sacramento Bureau

BYLINE: Lynda Gledhill

DATELINE: Sacramento

BODY:
Already on the defensive over its energy advisers' financial holdings, Gov. 
Gray
Davis' administration came under fresh attack yesterday when his chief 
spokesman
admitted buying $12,000 worth of Calpine Corp. stock last month.

???Steve Maviglio, Davis' acting director of communications, denied that his
purchase of the San Jose energy company's stock constituted a conflict of
interest. He said he would sell the stock if Davis or administration lawyers
asked him to.

???"I invested in a growing California company," Maviglio said. "It's sad when
somebody tries to link owning energy stock with a conflict of interest."

???The revelation came the same day that two high-priced consultants Davis
brought in earlier this year to help sell his energy policies to the public
agreed not to take any money for the work they have done. Davis was criticized
for hiring the two, partly because they had also worked as consultants for
Southern California Edison.

???On Friday, Davis fired five energy advisers for possible
conflict-of-interest problems after they helped negotiate state spot-market
purchases or long-term power contracts. Four of the five owned stock in 
Calpine,
and the fifth held Enron shares.

???ON THE DEFENSIVE

???Maviglio, who had the task of explaining the firings, was on the defensive
himself yesterday.

???He bought the Calpine stock in June after asking his broker to invest in it
when shares hit a certain price, he said. He said that showed he had made his
decision independently of whatever action he might have taken in the 
governor's
office on any particular day.

???Calpine's stock has dropped some in the past month. As of yesterday, the 
300
shares that Maviglio bought for $12,000 were worth about $11,100.

???Maviglio said he had spoken out against Calpine as much as other energy
companies. He also owns Enron stock that he bought in February 1996 and has
disclosed on all forms, he added.

???"I've called them pirates and gougers and lumped them in with all the rest
of the generators," Maviglio said.

???Secretary of State Bill Jones, an announced GOP opponent of Davis for
governor in 2002, said Maviglio should be fired.

???"These actions are unethical and unacceptable," said Jones, who called on
the governor's staff to release updated conflict-of-interest statements. "He 
had
the power to promote Calpine through press releases. That seems to me to be a
clear conflict of interest."

???Calpine sold the state $14 million worth of power earlier this year and has
a large share of the $43 billion in long-term contracts for electricity that 
the
state has entered into.

???Earlier this month, when he threw the ceremonial switch on a new Calpine 
plant in Pittsburg, Davis singled out the company as being more cooperative 
with
California than out-of-state suppliers that the governor has characterized as
gougers.

???IMAGE-POLISHING

???The Davis administration tried to put another energy-related controversy
behind it yesterday as the two consultants brought in by the governor to 
burnish
his image agreed to forgo more than $50,000 in work they did for the state.

???Chris Lehane and Mark Fabiani will receive no compensation and will leave
the Davis administration immediately, under a settlement in a lawsuit filed on
behalf of a national taxpayer rights group.

???Lehane and Fabiani -- nicknamed the "Masters of Disaster" for their work in
getting former President Bill Clinton out of political jams -- started in the
governor's office in May and were originally supposed to be paid $30,000 a
month.

???It was later revealed that they had also worked as consultants for Southern
California Edison, which is trying to swing a deal with the state to avoid
bankruptcy. State Controller Kathleen Connell said she would not pay the two.

???"It really raises the question in my mind, what is it about
conflict-of-interest and other ethical rules that the governor's office 
doesn't
understand?" said Lewis Uhler, president of the National Tax Limitation
Committee, which filed the lawsuit.

???In June, Davis said Fabiani was no longer a communications consultant
because his work had been "successfully implemented." Lehane, on the other 
hand,
dropped his contract with Edison and signed a new agreement with Davis.

???Lehane's new contract required him to work a maximum of 66 hours a month at
$150 an hour. His payments were to be capped at $76,000 for work from June 26 
to
Nov. 20, 2001.

???'OUTRAGEOUS EXPENSE'

???"This was an outrageous expense to taxpayers," Uhler said. "I believe there
was a clear violation of conflict-of-interest laws."

???The consultants decided it was not worth the legal fees to fight the
lawsuit, Maviglio said. The two could not be reached for comment.

???"It's shameful when people have to surrender their jobs in public service
because of a lawsuit," Maviglio said.

???Jones, who filed a complaint with the Fair Political Practices Commission
concerning the two consultants, said, "I think it's clear from recent actions 
by
the governor's office that there have been rampant violations of the state's
conflict-of-interest laws. Their attempts to mitigate the damage from these
violations is too little, too late."

???Jones said Davis should immediately require all of the consultants hired
during the energy crisis to file financial statements. There are 21 advisers
involved in power purchasing whom Davis has exempted, he said.

???All the contractors who are required to file reports have done so, said
Maviglio.

???In a related development, the Los Angeles Times quoted a source as saying
the Securities and Exchange Commission has launched a preliminary inquiry into
whether energy consultants advising Davis used inside information to trade
stocks of power companies doing business with the state.

???The federal agency began its review late last week, the source said, in
response to a request from Jones.E-mail Lynda Gledhill at

HEADLINE: Will BGE split lead to Calif. power problems?

DATELINE: BALTIMORE

BODY:

??Whether Baltimore Gas and Electric can remain profitable after spinning off
its power generating and marketing efforts to create a new company is the
subject of a three-day before state regulators this week.

??Regulators are hoping to avoid the problems that followed the deregulation 
of
the electricity market in California, where skyrocketing power prices led to
blackouts and financial problems for utilities unable to pass on higher costs 
to
consumers because of rate regulations.

??The Public Service Commission will decide whether BGE, the largest utility 
in
the state, can remain profitable if it is allowed to leave Constellation 
Energy
Group Inc. later this year.

??Regulators are concerned about the utility's ability to provide electricity
to consumers at rates frozen until 2006 under last year's deregulation 
agreement.

??Constellation announced plans in October to split into two publicly traded
companies. Constellation Energy Group would become a fast-growth national 
power
producer and marketer, and BGE Corp., would be a slow-growth company that will
include the regulated utility.

??Testimony filed by the state people's counsel, which represents consumers
before the PSC, pointed to concerns about the $2.4 billion in debt BGE will
carry after the split.

??A consultant to the people's counsel warned that such a high debt level 
could
make it difficult for the utility to handle unexpected problems such as severe
ice storms, hurricanes or spikes in the price of electricity.

??Constellation has submitted extensive confidential information to the PSC
about the separation, but it is still unclear what could happen if the
commission seeks to alter or block the plan.

??Although Constellation has fully cooperated with the PSC, company officials
maintain that the state has no authority over the transaction.

??The hearing, which begins Monday, runs through Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Davis press secretary confirms buying energy company stock

BYLINE: By ALEXA HAUSSLER, Associated Press Writer

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif.

BODY:

??Gov. Gray Davis' press secretary recently purchased the same energy stock as
five consultants the governor fired last week, he disclosed Monday.

??Steve Maviglio confirmed that on June 20, he bought 300 shares of stock in
Calpine Corp., a San Jose-based power generator that has received about $13
billion in state contracts to supply electricity for up to 20 years.

??Maviglio's disclosure comes after Davis' office hastily ended the contracts
of five consultants who helped negotiate state power contracts and held stock 
in
energy companies.

??In a related development, an anonymous source told the Los Angeles Times on
Monday that the Securities and Exchange Commission has launched a preliminary
inquiry into whether the consultants used inside information to trade the 
energy
stocks.

??About two dozen Davis energy consultants were required to fill out financial
disclosure statements after complaints of conflict of interest by Republicans
and consumer groups.

??"When we reviewed them, we found possible violations of the law and took
swift action," Maviglio said Monday before Secretary of State Bill Jones 
issued
a press release calling for his termination.

??Jones, a Republican, is a candidate for the GOP nomination to challenge 
Davis
in November 2002.

??Maviglio defended his purchase, saying that he "owns several stocks in
companies in all fields that are growing and are based in California."

??Maviglio said Monday that he requested on May 31 to purchase the stock if it
dipped to $40 a share, which it did two days after a June 18 ruling by federal
energy regulators restricting wholesale electricity prices in California and 
10
other states.

??Maviglio served as Davis' chief spokesman urging the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission to impose price ceilings on electricity wholesalers.

??He also said he owns between $10,000 and $100,000 stock in Houston-based
Enron Corp. He said he purchased the stock in 1997 and has reported it on
financial disclosure forms. He said that it is "closer to $10,000."

??Meanwhile, two energy consultants to Davis have agreed to forgo more than $
50,000 in work they did for the state.

??Chris Lehane and Mark Fabiani will forgo the payments as part of a 
settlement
with a Sacramento-area resident who filed a lawsuit objecting to their hiring,
calling it a conflict of interest.

??Fabiani could not be reached for comment Monday. In the settlement, they
admitted no wrongdoing.

??Lehane issued a statement through the governor's office, calling it "simply
not worth the bother to challenge the controller in court."

??Davis has come under fire for his May hiring of Lehane, former press
secretary for Vice President Al Gore, and Fabiani, a deputy campaign manager 
for
Gore's presidential run.

??They were hired to help shape Davis' response to the energy crisis, and
helped craft Davis' aggressive attack on Texas-based energy companies and
President Bush.

??Both also have advised Southern California Edison, which is negotiating for
state help in avoiding bankruptcy. Financial disclosure forms showed they have
each received at least $10,000 from Edison in the past year.

??Davis announced at the end of June that Fabiani terminated his contract, and
Davis scaled back Lehane's role with the state.

??State Controller Kathleen Connell then said she would not pay Lehane and
Fabiani for any of their work and now the two have agreed they will not fight
her decision, Maviglio said.

??Lewis K. Uhler, the Placer County man who filed the lawsuit, said the
settlement "accomplished our objectives."

??"We wanted to block the egregious use of taxpayer funds for essentially
political spinmeisters," he said. Uhler is president of the Roseville-based
National Tax Limitation Committee.

??Maviglio said that Fabiani and Lehane "did good work for the state" and
helped the state win victories with federal regulators.

HEADLINE: ?Calif. Sees $4B Less in Power Refunds

BYLINE: KAREN GAUDETTE


DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

BODY:

???California will receive refunds for overpriced electricity, but not as much
as it had asked for.

??A closer reading of last week's order from federal energy regulators shows
the amount the state will receive could be slashed to just under $4 billion 
less
than half what the state requested.

??Gov. Gray Davis plans to appeal the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
decision Monday, state officials said. Refunds could help prevent the state 
from
raising electric rates to cover its power buying costs, which are now beyond 
$8
billion.

??''We found a number of disturbing things that lead us to believe FERC may 
not
be so pro-refund as they want Californians to believe,'' said Nancy McFadden, 
an
adviser to Davis.

??For months, Davis and other state officials have asked the commission to 
rule
electricity prices charged since May 2000 to be unjust and unreasonable prices
which climbed 10 times higher than past years.

??The state stands to lose a portion of the billions it has spent buying
electricity for Pacific Gas and Electric Co. customers and two other 
financially
ailing utilities. Power companies maintain they did not work together to drive
up power prices to unreasonable levels.

??The commission's 40-page decision confirms it will only order refunds for
power bought since October 2000, rather than May 2000. That means $2 billion
less than the state, utilities and others could hope to receive, McFadden 
said.

??In addition, the commission also said it will not issue refunds for power 
the
state Department of Water Resources bought directly from power companies. FERC
only will recognize purchases through the state's now-defunct power market or
from the manager of the state's power grid.

??That stripped another $3 billion off the potential refund amount, reducing
the refund by a total of $5 billion. State officials had hoped to receive up 
to
$9 billion in refunds.

??A call to FERC for comment was not immediately returned Sunday.

??The commission has ordered an evidentiary hearing, to be completed within 60
days, to determine the size of the refund from providers of wholesale power.

HEADLINE: ?Texas Inches Toward Power Deregulation 

BYLINE: NATALIE GOTT


DATELINE: AUSTIN, Texas

BODY:

???After several delays, the entrance of Texas into the deregulated 
electricity
market is set to begin Tuesday.

??Under a pilot program, officials of the state's electrical grid will begin
switching some customers to new power providers at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday.

??The Legislature created the pilot program to give power companies several
months to test their systems before full-scale deregulation, which is 
scheduled
to begin Jan. 1 in most of the state.

??Industry officials have promised that deregulation will be smoother in Texas
than in California, where it has been blamed for rolling blackouts and
skyrocketing utility rates. They say the recent construction of several new
power plants in Texas will help the state avoid supply shortfalls that have
plagued California. 

??The Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which manages the state's grid,
gave the go-ahead for the pilot program last week.

??Deregulation allows customers to choose their power provider much like they
select a long-distance telephone carrier. Under the Texas pilot program, up 
to 5
percent of electric customers can switch power companies.

??The pilot program is getting under way nearly two months after its first
scheduled start date of June 1. Numerous delays were caused by computer
problems.

??While the delays were unfortunate, ''we think waiting until all the systems
are ready will let us provide good customer service,'' said Eleanor Scott,
spokeswoman for Austin-based Green Mountain Energy.

??California will receive refunds for overpriced electricity, but not as much

??A closer reading of last week's order from federal energy regulators shows

FERC ruling in December abolished the Power Exchange, the state's key entity
that bought and sold power. The Independent System Operator, keeper of the
state's grid, then began adding a surcharge on big purchases, McFadden said.

??All told, the most the state could expect to get back would be roughly $3.9
billion, said Barry Goode, a legal secretary to Davis. And despite the

HEADLINE: Developments in California's energy crisis

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

BODY:

??Developments in California's energy crisis:

??MONDAY:

??- After several delays, the entrance of Texas into the deregulated 
electricity market is set to begin Tuesday. Under a pilot program, officials 
of
the state's electrical grid will begin switching some customers to new power
providers at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday.

??- The third largest bankruptcy in U.S. history is also becoming the most
complex. As Pacific Gas and Electric Co. wades through its pile of debts, many
of the legal and financial teams representing the utility and its creditors
often run into conflicts of interest.

??- The state has been joined by natural gas industry players in accusing
Houston-based El Paso Corp. of restricting the flow of natural gas into
California to drive up its price and ultimately the cost to ratepayers. The 
gas
shippers that lease the pipeline space now also say El Paso is to blame for
soaring California energy prices. Those accusations came following a federal
regulatory hearing in May, the San Francisco Chronicle reported Sunday.

??- California will receive refunds for overpriced electricity, but not as 
much
as it had asked for. A closer reading of last week's order from federal energy
regulators shows the amount the state will receive could be slashed to just
under $4 billion - less than half of what the state requested.

??SUNDAY:

??- Gov. Gray Davis plans to appeal the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
decision, state officials say. Refunds could help prevent the state from 
raising
electric rates to cover its power buying costs, which are now beyond $8 
billion.

??WHAT'S NEXT:

??- The deadline for the Legislature to approve Davis' rescue deal for 
Southern
California Edison is Aug. 15.

??THE PROBLEM:

??High demand, high wholesale energy costs, transmission glitches and a tight
supply worsened by scarce hydroelectric power in the Northwest and maintenance
at aging California power plants are all factors in California's electricity 
crisis.

??Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric say they've lost
nearly $14 billion since June 2000 to high wholesale prices the state's
electricity deregulation law bars them from passing on to consumers. PG&E,
saying it hasn't received the help it needs from regulators or state 
lawmakers,
filed for federal bankruptcy protection April 6. Electricity and natural gas
suppliers, scared off by the companies' poor credit ratings, are refusing to
sell to them, leading the state in January to start buying power for the
utilities' nearly 9 million residential and business customers. The state is
also buying power for a third investor-owned utility, San Diego Gas & 
Electric,
which is in better financial shape than much larger Edison and PG&E but is 
also
struggling with high wholesale power costs.

??The Public Utilities Commission has approved average rate increases of 37
percent for the heaviest residential customers and 38 percent for commercial
customers, and hikes of up to 49 percent for industrial customers and 15 
percent
or 20 percent for agricultural customers to help finance the state's
multibillion-dollar power buys.

HEADLINE: ?California Releases Power Contracts

BYLINE: JENNIFER COLEMAN


DATELINE: SACRAMENTO

BODY:

???State Controller Kathleen Connell released details about four of
California's short-term contracts with power companies Monday, a move the
governor's office said could drive up wholesale energy prices.

??Democratic Gov. Gray Davis for months refused to release details of 
long-term
contracts the state had signed with electricity providers, saying the 
documents
needed to remain secret. He released 38 of the contracts in June, with key
portions blacked out.

??A judge ordered that the long-term contracts be released in their entirety
after several news organizations sued, including The Associated Press.

??But the four short-term contracts Connell released Monday along with the
long-term contracts were not part of the judge's mandate. The contracts reveal
the state's strategy for making day-to-day purchases, said Steve Maviglio,
spokesman for Davis. He said revealing the strategy could lead to higher
wholesale prices.

??''It shows the irresponsibility of the controller and every California who
gets a higher electricity bill can thank Kathleen Connell,'' Maviglio said.

??Connell said the judge heard all the evidence before ordering the complete
contracts released and ''there is no reason that information should raise
prices. Today's prices aren't going to be affected by prices engineered 
several
months ago.''

??But generators can use that information to time their sales and drive up
their prices, said Oscar Hidalgo, spokesman for the Department of Water
Resources.

??''We still feel that those will hinder our leverage in gaining reasonably
priced power on the spot market,'' he said ''It shows our position on the 
daily
spot market and what we're willing to pay,'' he said.

??Some state officials have criticized the long-term deals most of which are 
10
years saying they are too long.

??By signing long-term contracts including 41 deals with 27 power generators
worth about $43 billion the state could get burned if energy prices go down,
said Public Utilities Commissioner Richard Bills.

HEADLINE: Tourists to California just roll with the outages

BYLINE: By Jasmine Kripalani

BODY:

??SAN FRANCISCO _ Tourists are constantly asking the gift shop manager at Coit
Tower if a blackout could occur while they ride the elevator to the top of the
210-foot fire hose nozzle-shaped landmark.

??"They're serious when they ask it. I always tell 'em, 'We got the last guy
out in only three days,' " said Walt Lo.

??Tour guides, hotel managers and gift shop clerks in the Bay Area have
developed a sense of humor about the California energy crisis. But for many
visitors the perception of blackouts conjures up images of streets without
traffic lights and people trapped in elevators.

??Before leaving their Indiana suburb for vacation, Mike and Lisa Bonahoom
worried about what was ahead, but not enough to stop them from booking a
three-night stay at the room designed by former Grateful Dead frontman Jerry
Garcia in the Hotel Triton.

??"The perception in the Midwest is that (Californians) don't have lights,"
said Mike Bonahoom.

??Lisa, added: "We heard news reports that they shut the lights off every day
(at a set time) in order to save electricity, and people would plan their day
around that. I worried about getting stuck in an elevator for hours, but I
didn't mention any of this to the kids."

??It's a fear California's travel and tourism commission is taking so 
seriously
that it has handed a public relations firm about a half-million dollars to 
plan
an advertising campaign that will convince the rest of the world that it's 
still
safe to travel to the Golden State.

??Communications director Fred Sater blames visitors' fears on the media's use
of the term "rolling blackout."

??" 'Planned outage' or 'power interruption' _ that's the correct phrase," he
said. Sater believes "rolling blackout" inaccurately implies long periods of
darkness across the state.

??The San Francisco visitors bureau has taken a less expensive approach. It 
has
posted a letter and Frequently Asked Questions list on its Web site
(www.sfvisitor.org) that assures potential visitors that emergency services 
are
still available and that they won't get stuck on an amusement park ride.

??But all the warnings in the world wouldn't have done much good on a recent
Thursday at about 1:10 p.m. when the lights in parts of San Francisco 
flickered,
then went out for about an hour.

??Pacific Gas & Electric said 7,000 of its customers were without power and
attributed it to a bad cable between Broadway and Vallejo on Mason Street.

??One of those customers included a souvenir shop near Fisherman's Wharf.

??Kathy Joy had to wait several minutes before she could complete a sweatshirt
purchase. The cashier rushed to the front of the store with her solar-powered
calculator in hand and returned with a total.

??"That'll be $19.90," Sharon Stevenson told Joy and added that she could only
accept cash. Joy had the cash.

??Other stores, many of which mistook the outage for a blackout, were forced 
to
shut down their businesses.

??Sean Farber, a sales manager at Studio 39, a video-making business in which 
a
person's body is transposed on a backdrop of the Golden Gate Bridge, took
advantage of the power outage to express his political viewpoint by posting a
sign that read: "Thanks to PG&E, Enron, and George W Bush We will be closed
until 3:00."

??Others saw the outage as an entrepreneurial opportunity.

??"Hey, folks, there's a rolling blackout. You might as well go on a Bay
cruise," a tour operator loudly offered.

??Many didn't even notice the hourlong power outage.

??Two visitors from Naples, Fla., who were in town for the recent NASCAR 
races,
noticed the darkened businesses only after a reporter pointed it out.

??"Well, if this means I can't get into the pub, I will be very upset," said
Craig Barrero, who was clad in shorts and toting a video recorder.

??Other tourists said the only time the energy crisis has affected them is 
when
they're ready to check out of their hotel room.

??When Robyn and Ben Reeve from Australia walked into their room at the Hilton
on Fisherman's Wharf, they found the usual amenities: tightly tucked linens
between mattresses and the bathroom towels symmetrically draped over a brass
bar.

??The Reeves also found a letter from the general manager informing them that
they would have to pay a $2.85 energy tax per night.

HEADLINE: Duke Energy agrees to refund money

BYLINE: Bill Ainsworth

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif.

BODY:

??As hot summer weather triggered the first Stage 2 power alert yesterday in
more than a month, Duke Energy agreed to refund money from an earlier 
extremely
high price to comply with an order from federal regulators.

??While California was able to squeeze by with tight power supplies, southern
Nevada was not so lucky and was forced to endure brief rolling blackouts 
during
triple-digit heat.

??California's electricity grid manager, the Independent System Operator, had
issued the last previous Stage 2 alert on May 31.

??The hot weather is expected to continue. ''Conservation is going to play a
key role in reducing demand,'' said Greg Fishman, spokesman for the ISO.

??California's electricity demand peaked at about 4 p.m. with 41,600 
megawatts,
with an available supply of 42,402 megawatts. A megawatt can power about 750
homes.

??Meanwhile, Duke Energy announced that it would follow rather than fight an
order from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to refund money from 
January
when it charged a state record $3,880-per-megawatt hour. Duke was allowed to
charge only $273 per megawatt-hour, according to FERC.

??The North Carolina-based company said that it would slash $20 million from
California's power bill, including $2.1 million from February.

??Unlike the action for January, the February price cut was not ordered by the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

??''It's our way of creating a good working atmosphere to come up with some
solutions,'' said Terry Francisco, a company spokesman.

??The money is a mere fraction of the $805 million that the ISO says the
company overcharged California residents.

??In all, the ISO says power companies have overcharged California at least $
8.9 billion.

??Company officials, meanwhile, continued to fight price-gouging charges
leveled by former employees of Duke's Chula Vista, Calif., plant.

??They held a news conference explaining in detail the actions it took from
Jan. 16 through Jan. 18, a time when it charged the state the record price for
power.

??Previously, the company had released a memo from the ISO saying that the
Chula Vista plant was operating under the grid manager's instructions when it
throttled up and down during that period.

??Jeff Stokes, executive vice president of Duke, would not detail the price 
the
company charged during that time. But in addition to the $3,880 per megawatt
hour, he said, Duke charged between 25 percent and 33 percent of that record
price. That would make the other prices about $1,000 per megawatt hour.

??Yesterday, a megawatt hour sold for $92 on the spot market, and that's about
three times the going price in the spring of 2000.

??Officials from the ISO say the amount of the bids the company offered is
needed to determine whether Duke engaged in price gouging.

??A March report by the ISO accused generating companies of driving up prices
in two ways: by withholding power and by bidding prices so high the state
couldn't afford them.

??Gov. Gray Davis said, in a written statement, that Duke owes Californians an
explanation.

??''Duke has a lot of explaining to do for charging Californians the 
outrageous
price of $3,880 a megawatt hour,'' he said.

Generator Bows, Pledges to Cut Electricity Bill by $20 Million;
Power: Duke Energy had been accused by the state of price gouging. Gov. Davis 
insists that the company still has much to explain.

BYLINE: NANCY RIVERA BROOKS, RICH CONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITERS

BODY:

??Caving to state and federal pressure, Duke Energy Corp. said Monday that it
will reduce by $20 million the amount it claims it is owed for electricity 
sales
in California. 

??The Charlotte, N.C., company is one of the state's largest power plant
operators and, with other generators, has been flayed by politicians and
regulators in recent months for alleged overcharges in the California market 
and
for supposedly manipulating electricity supplies.

??Duke also on Monday formally released internal documents of its own, as well
as from the California Independent System Operator, showing that the agency 
was
responsible for huge swings in production at a San Diego-area power plant that
sparked accusations of price gouging.

??In sworn testimony June 22 before a state Senate investigating panel, three
former workers at Duke's Chula Vista plant offered internal operating logs for
three days in January, saying they showed that the company throttled 
generators
up and down "like a yo-yo" to boost prices during power emergencies.

??The company denied the allegations, saying that the workers were not in a
position to know that Cal-ISO, which operates most of the statewide power 
grid,
was controlling the changes.

??Duke has been "shocked and appalled by the accusations that have been 
leveled
against our company," said Jeff Stokes, its executive vice president for 
Western
gas and power. The letter from Cal-ISO acknowledging that it ordered the
production gyrations in the course of maintaining grid reliability was 
reported
Saturday by The Times.

??Duke said the $20-million refund for January and February will come from a
"credit premium" that it had placed on electricity sales because it feared it
would never be paid by Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric, 
the utility companies then lurching toward bankruptcy. PG&E has since filed 
for
bankruptcy-law protection, and Edison remains financially shaky.

??The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in June said Duke was entitled to 
no
more than $273 per megawatt-hour of electricity in January and ordered the
company to pay back everything it reaped above that price for the
month--including an infamous charge of $3,880 per megawatt-hour, which a
spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis called "obscene."

??Davis said Monday that Duke still has much to explain.

??"There's no doubt in my mind that there's been an effort by many of the 
power
producers to 'game' the system," Davis said, after dedicating Calpine Corp.'s
540-megawatt Sutter Energy Center in Yuba City, the second of four major power
plants to begin operation this summer.

??So far, Duke executives said, the company has been paid less than 2 cents on
the dollar for the power it provided the state in January and February. The
federal commission is holding a settlement conference to seek agreement on
possible refunds owed California by power generators and marketers.

??A Cal-ISO spokesman declined to comment on the Duke revelations, citing a 
gag
order imposed by the administrative law judge overseeing the settlement
conference.

??Although Cal-ISO late Friday acknowledged that the ramping at the Chula 
Vista
plant was in response to its orders, representatives of the grid agency, the
governor's office and the special state Senate committee probing alleged power
gouging warned Monday that Duke's activities at the plant are still being
scrutinized.

??The ramping activity ordered by Cal-ISO is only part of the picture, they
say. Further investigation of pricing is underway.

??State officials suggest, for example, that the grid operator may have ramped
down generation at times to avoid paying unreasonably high prices. Duke Energy
has refused to release details of the prices it charged for power on the days 
at
the heart of the ex-employees' allegations, and did so again Monday in a
conference call with reporters.

??Under questioning Monday, Duke executive Stokes did indicate that the prices
charged for the power associated with the January logs were in the range of $
1,000 to $1,500 per megawatt-hour, enough electricity to serve about 750
California homes for an hour.

Senate Panel's Resolution Backs Power Plant Seizures;
Energy: State lawmakers hope to put pressure on producers accused of 
exploiting
California. Governor brings another facility online.

BYLINE: CARL INGRAM, TIMES STAFF WRITER

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO

BODY:

??Hoping to pressure out-of-state electricity sellers accused of exploiting
California during the long energy emergency, a legislative committee on Monday
urged Gov. Gray Davis to begin seizing power plants.

??The Senate Rules Committee approved a nonbinding resolution that tells the
governor the Senate would support seizures if Davis takes such a step.

??All three Democrats on the committee, including Senate leader John Burton of
San Francisco, author of the measure, voted to send it to the full Senate, 
where
approval is expected. It does not require passage by the Assembly.

??The committee's two Republican members abstained from the vote. They also 
did
not argue against the resolution.

??Burton, who has been eager to commandeer a power plant or two, said Davis 
did
not ask for the resolution. But gubernatorial spokesman Steve Maviglio said 
the
governor is grateful for any support he can get.

??Davis, at a ceremony near Yuba City where he marked the opening of a new
540-megawatt power plant, made no mention of the resolution but lashed out at
some of his favorite targets--those same out-of-state generators.

??"We have been a cash cow for Houston, Texas, and Charlotte, North Carolina,
and Oklahoma," Davis said. "That is going to stop."

??In his State of the State speech in January, Davis warned that he would
invoke his emergency powers of eminent domain to seize power plants, if it 
meant
keeping electricity flowing in California. 

??Taking over power plants, Burton argued, would "stabilize" the sky-high
wholesale prices that Californians have been paying for almost a year. The
measure notes that some prices have soared as high as $3,900 a megawatt-hour, 
50
times higher than just two years ago.

??The measure calls the wholesale electricity market in California "grossly
dysfunctional" and characterized by the "abuse of market power and the
withholding of electricity supply."

??The resolution provides no documentation, however, of the charges. A special
Senate committee is looking into whether generators are manipulating the 
market
to drive up profits.

??None of the out-of-state wholesalers that might be affected by the 
governor's
action returned calls seeking a response.

??The new gas-fired plant that was activated on Monday will produce enough
electricity for 500,000 homes. It was the second major plant start-up in a 
week.

??Standing in front of the giant turbines and cooling stacks of the Calpine 
Corp. plant, Davis said the state will be bringing more energy online during
this two-week period than it had in the preceding 13 years.

Power Sales Halted by New Pricing Curbs;
Electricity: Confused suppliers, unsure what they will be paid, refuse to sell
to state, which asks FERC for a ruling but doesn't get it.

BYLINE: NANCY VOGEL, TIMES STAFF WRITER

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO

BODY:

??Confusion over new federal price restrictions prompted several electricity 
sellers to back away from sales to California on Monday afternoon, pushing the
state closer to blackouts, energy officials said.

??The state lost sales that would have provided enough electricity to supply
more than 1 million homes, said Ray Hart, deputy director of the California 
Department of Water Resources, which has been buying much of the state's
electricity since January.

??At least five companies producing or marketing power "are telling us that
since they don't know what they're going to get paid, they're not going to 
take
the risk, and so they're not going to sell the energy," Hart said.

??The electricity sales fell through after power consumption soared in summer
heat and grid operators were forced to declare a Stage 1 emergency, meaning
reserves had dipped below 7%. It was the first such emergency since May 31.

??Under a June 19 order by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission intended 
to
bring down wholesale electricity markets across the West, a power emergency in
California triggers the setting of a new price limit that applies to power 
plant
owners from Washington to Arizona.

??The new price is supposed to be based upon whatever it costs to run the most
inefficient, expensive power plant selling electricity to California grid
operators during the first full hour of a Stage 1 emergency.

??But much uncertainty remains about exactly how and when the new price is
supposed to be established under the commission's order, and that apparently
drove away sellers, Hart said.

??Shortly after the state issued the Stage 1 alert at 1:30 p.m., putting the
old price limit of $90 per megawatt-hour in question, companies that had
committed to provide the state electricity hour by hour Monday afternoon 
backed
out, Hart said. The companies include TransAlta Energy Marketing of Oregon,
Constellation Power of Baltimore and Sempra Energy Trading, a unit of the San
Diego-based energy conglomerate.

??Forced to dip even deeper into the state's power reserves and declare a 
Stage
2 emergency, water agency officials called the federal energy commission's
hotline for clarification about what the new price should be and when it 
should
take effect. They got no answer.

??Hart said commission officials reached at home promised to try to clarify
their order today. One outstanding question is what obligations power 
suppliers
have to deliver electricity to California in an emergency.

??Both buyers and sellers in the market agree that the new price, when it is
set, will probably be lower than $90 per megawatt-hour because the price of
natural gas, the main fuel in California power plants, has dropped lately.

??Temperatures soared several degrees higher Monday than grid operators had
anticipated. But they said they expected to avoid rolling blackouts in part
because the Bonneville Power Administration in Portland, Ore., had agreed to
provide several hundred megawatts of Pacific Northwest hydropower each hour in
exchange for a return of electricity from California later this summer.

??"Bonneville is giving us emergency power to get us through," Hart said.

Hidden Costs Revealed in Power Pacts

BYLINE: RICH CONNELL, ROBERT J. LOPEZ, JEFFREY L. RABIN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS

BODY:

??California consumers on Monday were given their first detailed glimpse of 
the
unpredictable and potentially higher costs they'll face in the future under
power-buying deals signed by Gov. Gray Davis' administration.

??State Controller Kathleen Connell released previously secret elements of the
state's long-term electricity contracts, along with a new warning that the 
price
tag could exceed the administration's previous estimate of $43 billion.

??Technical vagaries in the pacts, Connell said, could leave state power bills
open to wild fluctuations over the next decade. Even after weeks of analyzing
the 41 agreements, she said, her office is still unable to say "what the 
[cost ]
ceiling could be."

??Among other things, the controller said, most costs under the contracts are
now running between $70 and $200 per megawatt-hour, and she predicted that 
costs
over the next decade will be far higher than the $69 per hour suggested by
Davis' aides.

??More certain are the amounts the state is paying more than two dozen private
consultants who have been drawn into the electricity crisis and whose 
contracts
also were released Monday by the controller.

??Some of those consultants--working on behalf of Davis or the state agency
that has been purchasing power since January--are making tens of thousands of
dollars each month.

??Connell's release of the uncensored electricity contracts came one day after
the California attorney general said Davis would not appeal a judicial order
declaring them public records in their entirety. The court action in San Diego
was filed by The Times and other news organizations.

??Three weeks ago, after another ruling favorable to the media, the
administration released the contracts, which will govern the cost of wholesale
electricity for years to come. But key technical provisions were redacted from
those documents.

??Davis planned to release the contracts later this week, but the controller
upstaged him Monday, offering her own spin on the deals and prompting the
governor's office to shoot back.

??His aides insisted Connell's warning of possibly higher costs was based on
incomplete information. Her price figures, they said, were skewed toward
purchases made earlier in the year, when electricity and natural gas prices 
were
significantly higher.

??"Unfortunately, the controller doesn't let the facts get in the way of a 
good
story," said Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio, adding that the controller has 
been
at odds with Davis since he endorsed her rival, Antonio Villaraigosa, in the 
Los
Angeles mayor's race. "This is just a drive-by shooting where she does not 
have
the full set of information."

??Millions in Hidden Costs

??Still, the contracts released Monday show for the first time the millions of
dollars in hidden costs that are being shouldered by taxpayers.

??At least one of the energy suppliers, Houston-based Dynegy Inc., negotiated
terms that allow it to pass along to the state high-cost delivery charges for
natural gas, experts said.

??Robert Michaels, an energy consultant and professor of economics at Cal 
State
Fullerton, said the Dynegy contract permits the firm to use the state's most
costly benchmark of natural gas prices.

??Dynegy "has its choice of the highest [cost delivery] point," said Michaels,
who once advised the company. Like Connell and others, Michaels said that even
with the complete picture of the contracts, it is difficult to determine how
much added cost ratepayers may face as the deals extend into the next decade.

??Also, in just the first three months of the Dynegy contract, the state 
picked
up about $10 million in pollution, start-up and other operational costs for 
the
firm.

??Likewise, a contract with San Diego-based Sempra Energy Resources, parent
company of San Diego Gas & Electric, allows the company to choose where it
delivers electricity into the state grid, Michaels said after an initial 
review
of the agreement.

??"It seems to offer a lot of flexibility for the supplier," said Michaels, 
who
also has been a consultant for power suppliers. "It's not obvious what the 
state
got out of this [deal]."

??The new details on fuel and emission costs underscored some critics' fears.
"As you look at the devil in the details, it gets worse," said UC Irvine
economist Peter Navarro.

??He noted, for example, that Dynegy has been one of the power merchants
labeled by Davis as "pirates."

??But examining the company's complete contract Monday, Navarro said, it 
seemed
as if the state was saying, "You pirate, take California's dowry."

??Navarro and other critics note that power prices have fallen dramatically in
recent weeks, well below those the state is paying under the long-term
contracts.

??A Times analysis of payments made so far under the contracts shows the
average cost per megawatt-hour has been $173. Recent spot prices for peak 
power
have been as low as $50 a megawatt-hour, according to surveys by Platts Energy
Trader, an industry newsletter. By Monday, when an energy emergency was
declared, the price had risen to about $92 a megawatt-hour.

??Administration officials, including Davis' chief contract negotiator, S.
David Freeman, have said the state had little negotiating leverage when many 
of
the deals were struck early this year.

??"Early on, we were having a very difficult time gaining any advantage," said
Oscar Hidalgo, spokesman for the state Department of Water Resources, which
oversees power purchases. Still, Hidalgo and others in the administration
contend the power deals will stabilize prices in the long term, and have tamed
high spot prices this year.

??"Now, we have gained the upper hand," Hidalgo said.

??A Big Payday for Consultants

??Meanwhile, payments to outside consultants hired to assist the governor and
the state Department of Water Resources in dealing with California's energy
crisis reached nearly $2.8 million by late last month, according to the 
figures
released Monday.

??But those payments represent only a fraction of the total contracts the 
state
has signed with a broad array of consultants to assist with the purchase of
power and acquisition of transmission lines, to provide legal and technical
advice, and to mount advertising campaigns and polish Davis' image.

??The agreements include a $1.5-million multiyear contract with the 
Washington,
D.C., law firm of Grammer, Kissel, Robbins, Skancke & Edwards, which 
specializes
in energy and environmental law.

??Attorney Elisa J. Grammer and other members of the firm will represent the
state in proceedings before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and 
related
court proceedings through the end of May 2004.

??Another contract calls for the state to pay $1.1 million to two New York
consulting firms--the Blackstone Group and Saber Partners--at the rate of $
275,000 a month. The contract includes the services of Joseph Fichera, one of
Davis' chief advisors on the energy crisis.

??Blackstone/Saber could be paid an additional $14.58 million if the
Legislature approves deals to buy electric transmission systems from the 
state's
three private utilities--the financially rocky Southern California Edison,
Pacific Gas & Electric, which has filed for bankruptcy, and San Diego Gas &
Electric. Critics say the contract, in effect, provides a huge financial
incentive for the consultants to boost the price the state will have to pay 
for
the transmission system, which would result in higher fees for them.

??Davis also drew criticism in late May when he hired two former White House
strategists--Mark Fabiani and Chris Lehane--at $15,000 a month each. Both also
did consulting work for Edison to help the utility win approval of a financial
rescue package that Davis is pushing. Critics charged the two had a conflict 
of
interest representing both the governor and the utility.

??The governor announced late Friday that Fabiani no longer works for him and
that Lehane would work for less money. Davis' statement said that Lehane would
be paid $9,900 a month, roughly the same pay as the governor's last
communications director, and he would not work for Edison while consulting for
Davis.

??Also released was the state's contract with the governor's energy
conservation czar, Freeman. The former head of the Los Angeles Department of
Water and Power is being paid $120,000 for six months' work from April 15
through Oct. 15.

HEADLINE: Power Company Rebuts Accusations of Gouging

BYLINE: ?By JAMES STERNGOLD

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, July 2

BODY:

??Duke Energy, one of California's larger electricity generators, and state
officials today rebutted charges by three former Duke employees that the 
company
had manipulated output to drive up prices, saying the shifts had been ordered 
by
a state-controlled agency. And the agency, the California Independent System
Operator, agreed.

??Stephanie McCorkle, a spokeswoman for the semi-independent agency, which is
empowered to manage the state's power grid, said it largely controlled how 
much
power was being produced by the Duke Energy plant. She added that the agency 
had
not offered this information at the time the former employees testified in the
State Senate because it had not been asked.

???In the Senate hearings on June 22, the three former plant workers said the
company had ramped output up and down, manipulated maintenance schedules and
even thrown away some spare parts at a plant in suburban San Diego County in 
an
apparent effort to drive prices higher in January when supplies were tight.

??The hearing was another theater in the war of words between the state and 
the
electricity generators, as each has accused the other of causing the energy
crisis.

??The state, particularly Gov. Gray Davis, has accused the generators of
gouging the state on the wholesale power market. Gov. Davis recently demanded
about $9 billion in refunds from the generators, including Duke, while the
companies have asserted that the state fell victim to market shortages created
by its own policies.

??Some top state officials had called the testimony by the three former Duke 
Energy employees -- two plant mechanics and a control room technician -- the
first "smoking gun," proving market manipulation.

??"In my opinion, there was price manipulation," Glenn Johnson, a certified
power plant mechanic, said of Duke's actions at the San Diego plant. Duke 
supplies about 5 percent of California's electricity from four plants in
California.

??But today Duke Energy sought to demonstrate that the state itself had caused
the fluctuations at its plants and that the people who testified were simply
unaware of the company's overall commitments to the market.

??The company offered a highly detailed presentation, saying that the rise and
fall in output had been ordered by the agency.

??Jeff Stokes, an executive vice president of Duke Energy, which has its
headquarters in Charlotte, N.C., offered copies of handwritten logs from the
plant and other documents to show that the workers saw only a partial picture 
of
the operation of the plants and so were unaware that at various times the 
agency
had deliberately set aside some of the output capacity as a reserve.

??Mr. Stokes explained that at times the plants are actually put at the
disposal of the agency, which increases or decreases output to maintain 
balance
in the overall electrical grid. At other times, the agency keeps some 
operating
capacity off-line as a reserve, so it can meet sudden increases in demand, he
explained.

??Mr. Stokes said the bottom line was that during those critical days in
January covered by the testimony in the State Senate, the plant, which has 
four
operating units, was effectively at the state's disposal.

??"The full available output was offered at all times," Mr. Stokes said.

??Ms. McCorkle, the spokeswoman for the agency, said of the presentation, "I
thought it was a very accurate description." She added that at times the 
agency
had not bought all the output from the plant because Duke was asking too much
for the power, not because it was being withheld from the market.

??Still, some remained skeptical. Governor Davis, who switched on a brand new
power plant in Sutter County today, said through his spokesman that he was not
convinced. Earlier, Mr. Davis had invited the three former plant workers to
breakfast and had offered a tribute to their integrity.

??"There are still a lot more questions out there," said Steve Maviglio, the
governor's spokesman.

??Mr. Maviglio said that even if Duke had refuted the charges the most
important issue outstanding was how much the power generators should refund to
the state for overcharges.

??There have been numerous investigations by federal and state agencies of the
wholesale prices charged this year, and several have found what they have
described as convincing evidence of overcharging. But no definitive orders 
have
been handed down and a host of investigations are continuing.

??Indeed, for an industry that was supposedly deregulated several years ago,
the utilities and power generators are now subject to the most intensive
regulatory scrutiny perhaps in their history.

??In fact, California triggered price limits in 11 Western states today by
issuing a power alert. It was the first time the limits went into effect since
they were imposed by federal regulators two weeks ago.

HEADLINE: Davis paying millions to energy consultants, contracts reveal

BYLINE: By Dion Nissenbaum

BODY:

??SACRAMENTO _ Gov. Gray Davis has agreed to pay more than $17 million to a
small group of financial experts and political consultants _ some of them 
dubbed
by critics as "a den of thieves" _ to help him steer his way clear of the 
energy
crisis.

??New contracts released Monday show that the price tag for energy consultants
has nearly doubled in recent months as the Democratic governor sharpened his
attacks on power companies.

??Among them are a former head of the Bonneville Power Administration who is
being paid $300 an hour, a Southern California financial adviser who gets $400
an hour and a security firm paid $45,000 to protect the office where state
workers buy energy.

??Because some of the state's biggest advisers have links to other major
players in the energy crisis, the deals have been criticized by some state
leaders and consumer groups.

??Included in the group are former executives with Southern California Edison,
which is trying to win legislative support for a financial bailout, and two 
New
York investment firms. Saber Partners and the Blackstone Group, which are 
being
paid $275,000 a month, could receive an extra $14 million if they can get
legislators to back the Edison bailout.

??State Controller Kathleen Connell, who released the contracts along with the
long-term energy contracts Davis signed with power companies, called the
arrangement "disturbing" and "unethical."

??Steve Maviglio, the governor's spokesman, derided Connell as "a termed-out
elected official who finished last in the Los Angeles mayoral primary with no
political future and this is the only way she can have relevance."

??"The governor makes no apologies for hiring the best talent he can to
negotiate the best deal for California," he added.

??Davis has been forced to scrap one high-profile contract. Last week, Davis
cut ties with Mark Fabiani, a veteran Democratic Washington political 
consultant
who was continuing to work for Edison while advising the governor.

??At the same time, Davis scaled back his deal with Fabiani's partner, Chris
Lehane, who will be paid $9,000 a month instead of $30,000 a month as 
originally
planned.

??Both men are still due $30,000 for work in June.

??Doug Heller, a consumer advocate for the Foundation for Taxpayer and 
Consumer
Rights, said Davis has created a "den of thieves" by hiring consultants who 
have
little loyalty to California.

??"The governor's goal should be to ensure protection for ratepayers," he 
said.

??Along with Fabiani and Lehane, Davis has agreed to pay up to $6.2 million to
the Electric Power Group, a firm headed by former Edison senior vice president
Vikram Budhraja. Budhraja is being paid $275 an hour.

??Davis also hired Edison vice president Larry Hamlin as his interim
"construction czar" and is paying him $165 an hour.

HEADLINE: California Officials Insist Energy Company Manipulated Prices, 
Output

BYLINE: By Brandon Bailey

BODY:


??Even as executives at Duke Energy were claiming vindication Monday, state
officials insisted that newly released dispatch logs for the company's Chula
Vista power plant don't necessarily absolve the firm of charges that it
manipulated electricity prices.

??Duke released documents Monday that contradict the testimony of three former
workers who accused the company of scaling back the plant's output in order to
drive up prices. The records show Duke was following orders from the state's
grid operator when the company ramped its generators up and down last January.

??But without corresponding information about Duke's prices, which the company
has declined to make public, state officials say there is no way to know if
North Carolina-based Duke was gouging or not.

??Grid officials said they might order a plant to reduce output if the price 
is
excessive, but they might later instruct the same plant to increase production
-- even when the price is high -- if customers need the power.

??A top Duke executive said Monday that the company charged roughly $ 1,200 
per
megawatt hour of power produced at the plant during the three days under
scrutiny -- well above a so-called soft price cap of $ 150 that was then in
effect. But the official, Duke executive vice president Jeff Stokes, declined 
to
discuss prices in detail.

??The controversy underscores the complexity of California's dysfunctional
energy market. While the evidence against Duke is unclear, experts say the
system is vulnerable to economic schemes that are far more sophisticated than
simply shutting down a generator to create an artificial shortage of
electricity. 

??"The full analysis is a lot more complicated," said Severin Borenstein, an
economist and director of the University of California Energy Institute who 
has
studied prices in the California market.

??Economists for the state's Independent System Operator, which runs the power
grid, have said their studies show power suppliers earned excessive revenue
primarily by refusing to sell at lower rates -- as opposed to shutting down
plants. The studies concluded that suppliers used sophisticated bidding
techniques to keep prices high.

??Power industry spokesmen have denounced the ISO studies as flawed and 
biased.
Suppliers have also denied shutting down plants or reducing output to drive up
prices.

??But when the three former Duke workers appeared before a state Senate
committee last month, many critics viewed their testimony as hard evidence of
long-suspected price-gouging. Among other things, the workers produced 
operator
logs that showed the output of two Chula Vista generating units was scaled up
and down during three days in January when the state was short of power.

??Though key legislators on the panel said they would reserve judgment, Lt.
Gov. Cruz Bustamante called the testimony a "smoking gun." Gov. Gray Davis 
hailed the men as "heroes" and invited them for breakfast.

??At the request of state officials, however, the ISO examined its logs for 
the
three days and issued a memo late last week that said the Chula Vista plant
operators were responding to ISO instructions.

??"The records released today are clear proof that the units were made fully
available and followed the direction of the ISO," Stokes said. During a news
conference, he explained that the ISO used the two units to help balance
supplies with fluctuating demand -- by keeping the units in reserve and 
issuing
frequent instructions to adjust their output throughout the day.

??ISO officials confirmed that they will call on plants to balance out supply
and demand. But they have also said the dispatch logs don't provide a complete
picture.

??"Price can be a factor" in accepting bids for electricity, said ISO 
spokesman
Gregg Fishman. "We're not going to use megawatts any longer than we absolutely
have to, if that power is at astronomical prices."

??Fishman declined to discuss specifics involving Duke. Under federal rules,
the ISO treats information about power plant production and energy prices as
confidential. It released its dispatch logs with Duke's permission, but was 
not
permitted to release price information.

??"It's only half the story," complained Steve Maviglio, the governor's
spokesman. He added that Duke "still has a lot of explaining to do."

??Duke doesn't want to release price information because that would give
competitors an insight into company strategies, said Stokes, who added that
prices would be disclosed "at the appropriate time and setting."

??Stokes also complained that Duke wasn't given a chance to defend itself
before the Senate investigating panel. Committee chairman Joe Dunn, D-Garden
Grove, said he is waiting for Duke to turn over price information and other 
data
before company representatives are scheduled to testify.

??Until then, Dunn added, "we still can't draw a final judgment."

HEADLINE: Uncensored power pacts made public;

State controller says deals will burden general fund for years

SOURCE: Chronicle Staff Writers

BYLINE: Carolyn Said, Christian Berthelsen, David Parrish

BODY:
State Controller Kathleen Connell yesterday released uncensored versions of
California's energy contracts, including short-term contracts that Gov. Gray
Davis had hoped to keep under wraps for three months.

???Connell said the contracts for $43 billion worth of power were negotiated 
at
the worst possible times, for higher prices and longer periods than are
necessary. But Davis' office countered that Connell was grandstanding and that
her release of short-term contracts would hurt the state in its negotiations
with power generators.

???Connell said the contracts showed California paying more than the $69 a
megawatt hour Davis had stated. Ranging from $44 to $249 per megawatt hour, 
most
are between $100 and $200 a megawatt hour, she said, adding that variables
prevented calculating an exact average.

???But Steve Maviglio, Davis' spokesman, said Connell had selectively mixed in
some higher-priced short-term contracts "to misrepresent facts about the price
we negotiated."

???Although a fellow Democrat, Connell has long had a contentious relationship
with Davis. In an interview yesterday, she said the deals Davis made could 
mean
the general fund would be in debt for years to come. She added that it 
appeared
the administration would run out of money to buy electricity by December.

???Davis is "indebting future generations of Californians to ease the 
potential
pain a portion of people might feel over the summer of 2001," she said.

???A judge ordered the contracts to be released two weeks ago, but Davis'
office blacked out many vital elements, such as where power would be generated
and transmitted. The judge last week ordered Davis to release that redacted
material, which the governor's office said he had planned to do this Thursday 
--
omitting the short-term contracts. Instead, Connell released the material
yesterday.

???Among other new revelations:

???-- Consultants. The state signed agreements for more than $15 million to
consultants for help in negotiating the contracts, legal advice and other
services, some for months or years into the future. To date, the state has 
paid
out nearly $2.8 million on those contracts, including $30,000 to S. David
Freeman, the former head of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, 
whom
Gov. Gray Davis retained as an energy adviser in April.

???The largest of the 27 consulting agreements was for up to $6.2 million with
Electric Power Group LLC of Pasadena for help in negotiating the long-term
contracts with the power providers. The firm is headed by several former
executives with Southern California Edison.

???"There are a number of consulting contracts that appear questionable,"
Connell said. Citing one example, Connell said she had refused to pay the
contract of Mark Fabiani and Chris Lehane, two political image consultants
retained by Davis, because the firm was also representing Southern California
Edison.

???Maviglio said: "The governor makes no apologies for hiring the best talent
to fight the arsenal of generators. They have several floors of skyscrapers in
Houston armed with the best talent money can buy."

???-- LADWP. Los Angeles' municipal utility, the Los Angeles Department of
Water and Power, sold the state $57.8 million worth of power in March and 
April.
LADWP charged the state between $213.50 to $174.60 per megawatt-hour of
electricity, a price that included a 15 percent premium.

???LADWP was not profiteering, said Eric Pharp, director of public affairs for
the municipal utility. "I don't think most people would think that is
excessive," Pharp said. "Fifteen percent is what people felt was a reasonable
return." The 15 percent markup was decided on last December by Freeman, then
LADWP's director, and approved by the LADWP board.

???"What if LADWP found itself short of power, would it expect to get that
power from the state at a reasonable cost?" asked Severin Borenstein, head of
the University of California Energy Institute. "If they expect backstop help
from the state if they ever get in trouble, now's the time to step forward on
that basis."

???-- Price. Bill Marcus, principal economist with JBS Energy, a Sacramento
consulting firm that represents consumer and environmental groups in utility
issues, said the new material showed the state had paid huge amounts for
short-term power, more than twice as much as recent federal price caps.

???He also questioned whether California had acted in a panic to buy too much
power. "The system is not going to have enough flexibility built into it, come
three to four years from now if we keep signing contracts," he said. "I'd like
them to stop and take a breath, see if there are ways to change the worst
contracts, rather than running hell-bent for election as fast as they can,
trying to sign these things."

???Maviglio said the contracts represented a "balanced portfolio" of 
purchases;
provided California with a reliable price for electricity; and had helped 
drive
down spot market prices. "Instead of being vulnerable to the whims of the
market, we know exactly how much we'll be paying," he said.E-mail Carolyn Said

HEADLINE: Duke Energy Cuts Calif. Bill

BODY:




???Duke Energy, which supplies about 5 percent of California's electricity, 
agreed to reduce by $ 20 million the amount owed to it by the state for power 
it
supplied in January and February. Last month, the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission rejected Duke's explanation for high prices it charged for power 
and
ordered the company to pay refunds. Charlotte-based Duke had to reduce its
January bill by $ 17.8 million and its February bill by $ 2.1 million.



???Ford was urged by the attorneys general in 23 U.S. states to protect the
environment by replacing mercury switches used to light hoods and trunks in
millions of cars. The attorneys general wrote a letter calling on the 
automaker
to replace the switches in cars that are being recalled to have their
Bridgestone/Firestone tires replaced. The letter said the mercury in the
switches poses a health threat to humans and the ecosystem because it enters 
the
air when a car is scrapped and incinerated. Mercury can cause brain, lung and
kidney disease in humans.







??Best Buy has agreed to pay $ 5.4 million to resolve an overtime-pay dispute
involving about 70,000 current and former employees, the Labor Department 
said.
Workers were not paid for hours worked on their days off, during meal breaks,
after they punched out and while they waited for managers to unlock doors, the
department said. Best Buy also did not keep an accurate record of hours worked
by employees, a department official said. Back wages will be paid to workers 
who
were employed at all Best Buy stores from February 1998 to February 2000.

??Napster has suspended its online music-swapping service because it is unable
to stop the unauthorized exchange of songs. Napster discovered its users
continue to trade bootlegged songs, despite technological safeguards put in
place to comply with a federal court order mandating it halt the practice. The
company suspended its service late Sunday and said yesterday that it was not
clear when users would be able to resume trading songs online.

??Staples agreed to settle a lawsuit with shareholders who said a plan to buy
back $ 122 million worth of shares in its Internet unit from insiders was a
waste of corporate assets. Staples public shareholders will get more details
about how the company set the proposed buyout value at about $ 7 per share.
Venture capitalists, executives and directors paid $ 3.25 for the Staples.com
stock in 1999.

??Citigroup's $ 1.95 billion acquisition of European American Bank from ABN
Amro Holding, a purchase that will expand Citigroup's presence in New York 
City
and Long Island, has been approved by federal regulators. Several consumer
groups opposed the merger on claims Citigroup has engaged in abusive mortgage
lending practices. In response, federal regulators said they will closely
monitor Citigroup's lending business.

??Intel started shipping the fastest version to date of its Pentium 4
microprocessor. The new chip runs at 1.8 gigahertz, slightly faster than the
1.7-GHz Pentium 4 released in April. The company also released a 1.6-GHz 
Pentium
4 yesterday.

???Netpliance agreed to pay a $ 100,000 fine to the Federal Trade Commission
for deceptive advertising and billing practices of its discontinued I-opener, 
a
stripped-down computer that sold for $ 199. The FTC said Netpliance failed to
disclose extra costs associated with the computer, such as monthly Internet
service fees. Netpliance did not admit to any wrongdoing.

??T-bill rates rose. The discount rate on three-month Treasury bills auctioned
yesterday rose to 3.58 percent, from 3.375 percent last week. Rates on 
six-month
bills rose to 3.5 percent from 3.34 percent. The actual return to investors is
3.663 percent for three-month bills, with a $ 10,000 bill selling for $
9,909.50, and 3.612 percent for a six-month bill selling for $ 9,823.10.
Separately, the Federal Reserve said the average yield for one-year constant
maturity Treasury bills, a popular index for making changes in adjustable-rate
mortgages, rose to 3.60 percent last week from 3.46 percent the previous week.

??NextWave Telecom said it has entered an all-cash deal with Lucent
Technologies to begin construction of local wireless networks in Detroit and
Madison, Wis. NextWave, which filed for bankruptcy in 1998, said it has "ample
funds" to launch the project. NextWave reiterated that it plans to emerge from
bankruptcy.

to become the country's second-largest maker of bread.



??Barnes & Noble.com, following the lead of rival Amazon.com, is offering free
shipping on orders of more than one item.



??DuPont sharply curtailed its earnings forecast for the second quarter,
blaming a global economic slowdown and a strong dollar. The company now
estimates earnings per share, before one-time items, to be 35 to 45 cents, 
down
from 90 cents per share in the same quarter last year. Wall Street was 
expecting
earnings of 53 cents a share.

??Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing said it expects lower second-quarter
earnings because of continued weakness in the U.S. economy, an increased
slowdown in Europe and Asia, and negative currency effects. It predicted a
profit of $ 1.10 to $ 1.14 per share, excluding one-time items but including
negative currency effects. ?In the second quarter of last year, 3M earned $ 
1.18
per share.



??The International Monetary Fund postponed a decision on disbursing a $ 1.5
billion loan to Turkey because the Ankara government has failed to implement
some of its pledges to overhaul the nation's banking system and state-owned
telephone monopoly. The decision to delay a vote by the IMF's board is the
latest snag in a $ 19 billion bailout of Turkey that was arranged in February
after the Turkish lira collapsed.

???Global semiconductor sales fell more than 20 percent in May from a year
earlier, continuing a decline that began in November, a trade group said. The
Semiconductor Industry Association said sales were $ 12.71 billion, which was 
a
7.3 percent decline from the April level.

HEADLINE: Duke releases California energy records to counter accusations of
price gouging

BYLINE: By LESLIE GORNSTEIN, AP Business Writer

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

BODY:

??Duke Energy has released operating logs to counter accusations by former
workers that it reduced output to boost prices during California's energy
crisis.

??Ex-employees told state investigators two of four turbines at Duke's 
southern
California plant were shut down for three days in January during Stage 3 power
alerts, which can lead to rolling blackouts.

??The records show that during most of that time, units One and Two at the
South Bay plant in Chula Vista were either supplying all their power to the
California market or providing what are called ancillary services.

??That's when a plant is paid not to produce, but to stand by in case of
emergency, or if the state's grid is already at capacity.

??California's Independent System Operator, which manages most of the state's
power grid, has acknowledged that it, not Duke, was controlling the turbines 
at
the time.

??"Duke was responding to their requests," Jeff Stokes, executive vice
president of Duke's western gas and power operations, said Monday.

??Stokes added that Duke's prices during those three days were somewhere 
around
25 percent of the $3,880 figure noted by the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission when it singled out Duke for criticism in a June 19 order extending
price controls in California.

??State officials were not impressed with Duke's operating logs.

??Sen. Joe Dunn, chairman of the Senate Committee to Investigate Price
Manipulation, said Duke was releasing selected documents that presented 
"nowhere
near the complete picture."

??Dunn asked the ISO to analyze whether the Duke logs and its own logs 
indicate
any patterns that suggest price manipulation.

??Duke, based in Charlotte, N.C., also on Monday slashed $20 million from
California's power bill, becoming the first wholesaler to cut its charges for
electricity sold to the state during January and February.

??FERC has accused Duke of overcharging the state millions of dollars by
selling electricity at rates as high as $3,880 per megawatt-hour when it was
only entitled to charge $273 per megawatt-hour.

??Duke contested the gouging accusations but said it would abide by the
commission's order.

??"It's our way to say, let's get beyond that," Duke spokesman Terry Francisco
said. "Let's try to come up with a long-term solution."

??The ISO had no comment on Duke's $20 million move.

??Meanwhile, California's electric grid operator issued an energy alert Monday
for the first time since FERC imposed the cost ceilings, triggering price caps
in 11 Western states.

??Unexpectedly high temperatures brought higher energy use that required the
ISO to declare a Stage 2 alert for about three hours, meaning electricity 
reserves fell below 5 percent. The ISO maintained a Stage 1 alert into the
evening, meaning reserves were below 7 percent.

??California wasn't the only state wallowing in power woes Monday. 
Triple-digit
temperatures triggered rolling blackouts across southern Nevada for the first
time in the state's history.

??By the afternoon, Nevada Power's 1.2 million customers had cranked up air
conditioners enough to demand a record 3,924 megawatts of power, forcing the
utility to cut about 100 megawatts, or enough electricity for roughly 75,000
homes.

??"About 10,000 customers were affected for about an hour," said Paul Heagen,
spokesman for Nevada Power Co. "Today was a wake-up call."

??Nevada Power asked its major power users, including the neon-lit resorts on
the Las Vegas Strip, for voluntary reductions at about 3 p.m.

??Casinos switch to backup generators and took conservation measures that went
mostly unnoticed by guests.

??The utility also imposed rolling blackouts until it could purchase power on
the open market, Heagen said.

HEADLINE: Stage One and Stage Two Emergencies Declared as Demand Soars;
California ISO Strongly Urges Conservation

DATELINE: FOLSOM, Calif., July 2, 2001

BODY:


??The California Independent System Operator (California ISO) issued a Stage
One Emergency at 1:35 p.m. today, July 2, 2001, and a stage two emergency at
2:40 p.m. as operating reserves dipped below five percent. The state's 
appetite
for power is 2,000 megawatts over forecasts due to temperatures that are 5 to 
6
degrees hotter than meteorologists predicted. Because the heat wave is 
regional
in nature, levels of imported power have decreased as other states, especially
those in the southwest, also cope with high demand for power. In addition, 
1,500
megawatts of imported power was also reduced when a two-unit power plant that
serves Southern California tripped offline over the weekend.

??The expected peak demand on the transmission system is expected to reach
about 40,000 megawatts around 4:00 p.m. today. Consumers can help reduce the
strain on the power grid by conserving electricity today, especially during 
the
peak afternoon hours. The California ISO requests that customers voluntarily
reduce their use of electricity to prevent more severe curtailment measures.

??Powerful Habits at Home:

???????-- ?Set your thermostat at 78-80 degrees when home, 85 or off
????????????when away.
????????-- ?Avoid using appliances during the peak usage period 8:00
????????????a.m. to 8:00 p.m.
????????-- ?Turn off your pool pump and avoid outdoor watering during
????????????peak periods.

??Powerful Habits at Work:

???????-- ?Turn off computer monitor when you are away from your desk
????????-- ?Turn off half the overhead lighting.
????????-- ?Set the thermostat at 78-80

??Today's Stage One and Two declarations, expected to be in effect until 6:00
p.m., enables the California ISO to access emergency resources to help 
maintain
operating reserves. A Stage Two is declared when reserves drop below five
percent. At this level, large commercial customers that have signed up to
voluntarily curtail power during high demand days will be asked to do so. If 
an
operating reserve shortfall of less than one-and-a-half percent is 
unavoidable,
Stage Three is initiated. Involuntary curtailments of service to customers
including "rotating blackouts" are possible during this emergency declaration.
The California ISO's Electrical Emergency Plan (EEP) is part of the state's
enhanced reliability standards enacted by landmark legislation Assembly Bill
1890 that led to the restructuring of California's electricity industry.

??The California ISO is charged with managing the flow of electricity along 
the
long-distance, high-voltage power lines that make up the bulk of California's 
transmission system. The not-for-profit public-benefit corporation assumed the
responsibility in March 1998, when California opened its energy markets to
competition and the state's investor-owned utilities turned their private
transmission power lines over to the California ISO to manage. The mission of
the California ISO is to safeguard the reliable delivery of electricity, 
facilitate markets and ensure equal access to a 25,526 circuit mile "electron
highway."

Tauzin/Enron -2: Skilling To Testify Thursday

02/06/2002

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- U.S. Rep. Billy Tauzin (R-La.) said he expects former Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling will testify before Tauzin's committee Thursday. 
Tauzin said the committee will ask what Skilling's reaction was to the internal report that Enron's financial deals "were very suspicious" and why Skilling apparently tried to stifle those reports by reassiginig the official responsible for the reports.
"We'd love to hear his take on that," Tauzin said. 
Tauzin said he will ask why Skilling ignored repeated requests to sign so-called approval sheets for questionable mergers. Tauzin also told reporters there is no need to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Enron. 
"We are going to do our job," Tauzin said Wednesday in a brief interview with reporters covering a telecommunications conference in Washington. 
"We don't need a special prosecutor," Tauzin said. 
Tauzin is chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

Labor Secy. to Address Enron Hearings
Labor Secretary Elaine Chao to Speak to Congressional Panel on Post-Enron Efforts

The Associated Press
Feb. 6 
WASHINGTON (AP) The subpoenas are multiplying, the hearings mushrooming in Congress' investigation into the collapse of Enron Corp., a once powerful company transformed into a symbol of American corporate failure.
"The thought of employees sustaining huge losses while executives were able to sell stock for millions is infuriating," Sen. Joseph Lieberman said Tuesday. He announced he plans to issue a subpoena to get information about bonuses paid to company executives in the run-up to its Dec. 2 bankruptcy.
Lieberman spoke after a laid-off worker tearfully described losing $40,000 from her retirement account last fall as Enron slid toward collapse.
The hearings were picking up again Wednesday, with one committee hearing from Labor Secretary Elaine Chao about Bush administration plans to strengthen retirement account protections for millions of workers. Two other panels were to be active as well.
On Tuesday, Joseph Berardino, chairman of the accounting firm Arthur Andersen, drew the wrath of House members over Anderson's handling of Enron and the shredding of documents.
"You have squandered the integrity of your company," Rep. Gary Ackerman, D-N.Y., told him.
Berardino's response to the criticism: "At the end of the day, we do not cause companies to fail."
As no less than four congressional panels met on the Enron debacle, the Senate Commerce Committee approved a subpoena for Kenneth Lay, the former head of Enron who canceled plans to appear voluntarily Monday. "We have no choice," said Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D.
Rep. Michael Oxley, head of the House banking committee, signed a subpoena for Lay to appear before his panel on Feb. 14, two days after the Senate appearance.
Lay's attorney Earl Silbert dismissed any suggestion that Lay was "making himself scarce" to avoid investigators.
Lawmakers predicted Lay would invoke his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination when he appears.
A dozen committees are investigating Enron, along with the Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission. The energy-trading company has deep political ties in Washington, and politicians in both parties have scrambled to distance themselves from Enron.
The Justice Department has rejected calls by some Democrats for a special prosecutor.
"This is a business problem that our Justice Department is going to investigate, and if there's wrongdoing we'll hold them accountable for mistreatment of employees and shareholders," President Bush said Tuesday.
Millions of investors lost money, and thousands of current and former Enron employees lost the great bulk of their retirement savings, when the company collapsed. An Enron-sponsored investigation released over the weekend blamed senior management for failing to provide proper supervision over a complex web of partnerships that helped the company hide debt and post unrealistic profit figures.
Once disclosed, the transactions contributed to the company's unraveling
The biggest fireworks Tuesday were reserved for Berardino.
Oxley noted that the Enron internal investigation found active participation by Andersen in setting up the partnerships, and that the accounting firm had received $5.7 million for advice on the subject.
"You weren't just checking the boxes," he told Berardino, who claimed he wasn't in the loop, and Andersen's auditors didn't actively participate in setting up the partnerships.
"I did not do the audit of the company," he said. "Information was withheld from us."
Lead Enron auditor David Duncan was fired in January, accused by his employer of organizing the destruction of Enron documents.
The committee also heard testimony about a period of roughly three weeks last fall when individuals were barred from selling any stock in their retirement accounts, a lockout attributed to a change in plan administrators.
Because the price of Enron stock was dropping at the time, officials debated whether to postpone the lockout, but eventually decided not to. The company found "it was not feasible to notify more than 20,000 participants in a timely fashion," said Cindy Olson, Enron's executive vice president for human resources.
Enron's stock peaked at $82 a share on Jan. 26, 2001. It was selling for $15.40 at the close of trading on Oct. 26, the day the lockout began, and had fallen to $9.98 on Nov. 13, the day it ended.
At another hearing, the author of the withering Enron internal investigation described how the executives "enriched themselves ... by tens of millions of dollars" through questionable partnerships.

Enron Knew in March That Partnerships Caused Losses
2002-02-05 16:22 (New York)

     Washington, Feb. 5 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. knew in March that its affiliated partnerships were causing losses and made the problem worse by continuing to give stock to them, the law professor appointed to investigate the company told Congress.
     William Powers, dean of the University of Texas Law School, said Enron was facing a $500 million loss in March. Rather than report it to shareholders, he told the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Enron in March gave a partnership called Raptor another $800 million in Enron shares.
     "Enron compounded the problem,'' Powers said. "There's no question that virtually everyone, from the board of directors on down, understood that the company was seeking to offset its investment losses with its own stock.''
     The partnerships allowed Houston-based Enron to inflate earnings from the third quarter of 2000 until the third quarter of 2001 by $1 billion, Powers said.
     "More than 70 percent of their earnings for that 15-month period were false,'' Powers told the panel.
     Powers was appointed as an Enron director in November to lead an investigation at the board's request. He told the committee he expects to leave the board.
     Enron filed the largest U.S. bankruptcy protection petition Dec. 2. Congress, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice are investigating.

Lay's Responsibility

     Former Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay is responsible for knowing the partnerships would could cause the company he helped form in 1985 to collapse, Powers said.
     "Ken Lay isn't the Luke Skywalker here,'' Powers said, referring to the partnership names taken from the Star Wars movies in which Skywalker was the hero. "There were red flags that should've indicated to him what was happening. It's absolutely true Lay understood they were using their own stock to offset the losses in the partnerships.''
     The Senate Commerce Committee voted today to subpoena Lay after he canceled an appearance scheduled for yesterday. The House Financial Services Committee voted yesterday to subpoena him. Enron's collapse is being investigated by at least 10 congressional committees.
     Lay, who resigned from Enron's board yesterday, cited comments by lawmakers about the Powers report as the reason he canceled his testimony.
     "These inflammatory statements show that judgments have been reached and the tenor of the hearing will be prosecutorial,'' Lay's attorney, Earl J. Silbert, said in a letter to the Senate Commerce Committee.
     Tauzin, who said on television Sunday that he thought Enron executives likely broke the law, said at today's hearing that investigations by Congress, the Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission should have indicated to Lay that he faced legal troubles.
     "If that wasn't enough to warn you and your lawyers that you had real problems, then get yourself some new lawyers,'' he said.

Threatened Bonuses

     Investigators for the Energy and Commerce Committee found evidence some Enron employees had their salaries paid by the company and their bonuses paid by the special purpose entities, or partnerships, in question.
     "There's a lot of self-dealing here,'' said Representative Billy Tauzin, a Louisiana Republican and chairman of the committee, told reporters after the hearing. "There were actual signals sent that there were bonuses threatened'' if employees didn't participate in questionable actions.
     In his testimony to the committee, Powers said Enron misrepresented the financial condition of the company to shareholders because it wanted to hide involvement with and liability to special purpose entities such as Chewco LJM1 and LJM2. Former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow should have disclosed more to his superiors, he said.
     "Fastow should've come forward and disclosed he was self-dealing with partnerships on a much larger scale than he had told before,'' Powers said. "A CFO should be responsible for the financial aspects of the company. Fastow couldn't mind the store because he was involved in the transactions.''
     "Mr. Fastow seems to be the Betty Crocker of cooked books,'' said Representative James Greenwood, a Pennsylvania Republican.
     Fastow, who was fired on Oct. 24, made $30 million in two years from managing and investing in the LJM partnerships, an Enron filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission says.
     Fastow and former Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling are scheduled to testify before House and Senate panels Thursday.

House Panel Hears Enron's Powers Before Exec Testimonies
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

02/06/2002
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

(This article was originally published Tuesday.) 

By Bryan Lee
WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--The Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) board member who spearheaded an internal investigation told a House investigating panel Tuesday that key company executives should have been aware of liabilities with the company's off-the-balance-sheet partnerships, but he declined to assert that investors had been defrauded. 
William Powers, dean of the University of Texas law school, told the House Energy and Commerce Committee's oversight and investigations panel that top executives should have known that transactions with the partnerships were designed to hide billions in losses from public scrutiny. 
Key Enron executives involved in the partnerships "were definitely using Enron assets to enrich themselves," Powers testified. 
But he repeatedly declined to describe their actions as fraud, despite several attempts by lawmakers. 
"I'm not in a position...to say," Powers told Rep. Peter Deutsch, D-Fla., when he asked if shareholders were defrauded. 
When Deutsch pressed him for an answer, Powers replied that he wasn't in a position to determine the "state of mind" of the Enron officials involved in the partnership dealings. 
But Powers told Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., the committee's chairman, that there were no other discernible purposes of the partnerships except to hide the company's debt and enrich key senior Enron officers. 
"What we really have here is a case of inside theft," Tauzin said. 
Powers painted a highly critical picture of the roles played by former Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay; former Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling; former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow; former managing director of an Enron unit, Michael Kopper; Chief Accounting and Information Officer Richard Causey; and Chief Risk Officer Richard Buy. 
Many of those implicated by Powers are slated to testify before the committee Thursday. 
Powers, in an apparent reference to Lay, said Enron "management" didn't take "seriously enough" the concerns of Enron Vice President Sherron Watkins, who sent Lay a memo last August warning that Enron would "implode in a wave of accounting scandals." 
And Kopper, who reported to Fastow, entered into a deal that turned a minimum investment into a $10 million windfall "surreptitiously," without approval of Enron's board, Powers said. 
Skilling, whose surprise resignation last August spurred the Watkins memo, was aware of Kopper's involvement, Powers said. Skilling may have verbally approved the investment, but he didn't formally sign off on it, he said. 
Causey, Buy and Skilling were supposed to review Fastow's involvement in the partnerships and approve them as arms-length transactions, rather than sweetheart deals, Powers said. "The controls were not followed," he said. 
"Mr. Fastow wasn't in a position to mind the store, because he was personally involved in these transactions," Powers said, noting Fastow received "very substantial income from these investments" of at least $30 million. 
"Mr. Fastow appears to be the Betty Crocker of cooked books," said Rep. James Greenwood, R-Pa., chairman of the committee's Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee. 
After former Enron treasurer, Jeffrey McMahon - now the company's president - complained to Skilling about Fastow and the partnership dealings, Skilling transferred McMahon to another job, Powers said. Skilling "didn't do anything about very accurate concerns," he said. 
Powers also said Skilling attended an Enron board meeting where the "Raptor" partnerships were approved. Powers described the Raptor partnerships as engaging in sham investment risk-hedging transactions tied to the company's stock, which contributed to the company's financial undoing. 
Tauzin noted that Enron lawyer Jordan Mintz sent Skilling a memo three times encouraging Skilling to formally sign off on the Raptor transactions, but he never did. 
"He should have signed it. It was his responsibility to sign it. He didn't sign it and he didn't explain why he didn't sign it," Powers said. 
"I think Mr. Skilling knew a great deal about these transactions and how losses were being hedged with Enron's own stock," Powers said. "At a minimum, he wasn't attending to his own company," he said, adding that, in interviews, Skilling said he knew little of the Raptor transactions. 
Causey, the chief accounting officer, "knew a lot" about the transactions, Powers said. 
Rep. Christopher John, D-La., said that Causey backdated a document related to the Raptor stock swaps to hide Enron losses. "Is that fraud?" he asked. 
"Backdating is extremely serious," Powers said, once again declining to characterize actions as defrauding investors. "We found very compelling evidence that documents were backdated," he said. 
Tauzin, the committee chairman, described the Powers report as setting the stage for Thursday's hearing, which he said will detail how "sweetheart deals" were put together, and how employees were threatened with firings and loss of bonuses. 
"Your report tracks what our investigators have learned," Tauzin told Powers, describing the report's contents as painting a picture of "insider theft." 
The partnerships were clearly framed to hide Enron's true financial situation, Tauzin said. The executives involved benefited twice, first from inflating the value of Enron stock they owned, and then again by "sucking money out of the partnerships," he said. 
"How can anyone conclude that the FBI doesn't need to be over there with a set of handcuffs?" Tauzin asked rhetorically. 
Greenwood, the subcommittee chairman, described the Powers report and his testimony Tuesday as laying the "factual backdrop" for future hearings with officials from Enron and the company's outside auditor, Arthur Andersen LLC (X.AND). 
"We've discovered that, while thousands of hard-working employees suffered terribly, there was a small group at the top who carted away millions from these very deals that ultimately led to Enron's collapse," Greenwood said.

Fastow emerges as key player: Ran side partnerships: Ex-CFO to appear before committee tomorrow

His salary at Enron Corp. was just over US$500,000 in 2000, a paltry sum beside the US$30-million he is alleged to have made on the side. 
Now, the former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, is increasingly seen as a prime target in the Enron fiasco, as the creator of those complicated LJM partnerships that are said to have hidden at least US$1-billion in losses and triggered the widespread criticism of the energy trader's accounting methods.
That he was closely involved in LJM is beyond doubt; indeed, the acronym represents the first letters of the names of Mr. Fastow's wife and two sons. 
In recent days, the 40-year-old Mr. Fastow has been in talks with U.S. Justice Department officials about obtaining immunity in exchange for testimony. He is scheduled to appear tomorrow before the House energy and commerce committee. 
If a deal is not reached, Mr. Fastow is expected to invoke his Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate himself. 
His lawyers say the partnerships, which Mr. Fastow ran and had stakes in, were approved by top management and the board. They say accounting was the responsibility of others. 
Mr. Fastow bore many of the traits of the Enron environment itself -- cocky, aggressive, ambitious. 
Those characteristics were integral to selling deals to banks and institutional investors. Whether by veiled threat or sweet talk, Mr. Fastow got the deal done. "He had a dual personality. He could be charming but he could also be irrationally mean," one insider told Business Week. 
The partnerships Mr. Fastow and other executives are accused of having set up are said to have paid them millions of dollars while concealing losses from Enron shareholders. 
That's the thrust of the report from a special committee of the board of directors of Enron. "What he presented as an arrangement intended to benefit Enron, became, over time, a means of enriching himself personally and facilitating manipulation of Enron's financial statements," concluded the committee, chaired by William C. Powers, dean of the University of Texas law school. It maintains there were at least 13 transactions with Mr. Fastow's partnerships in which employees negotiating for Enron reported to the CFO. 
At the same time, Ken Lay, the former Enron chairman, and Jeffrey Skilling, the former chief executive, are partially absolved because they are said not to have know the extent of Mr. Fastow's dealings. 
"It seems to point the finger at his group of rogue financing and accounting types," says John Olson, an analyst with Sanders Morris Harris Inc. in Houston. "Enron gamed the system -- it gamed Wall Street, it gamed the lawyers, it gamed the auditing business -- but within the firm, you had a collection of people who were gaming Enron." 
Mr. Fastow and another senior executive, Michael Kopper, who made at least US$10-million, both refused to be interviewed by the committee. 
Insiders says it was Mr. Fastow's desire to rise in Enron and to please Mr. Skilling that was his downfall. 
He hired the same architect as Mr. Skilling to build his new home in the exclusive River Oaks section of Houston. But it was his aggressive tactics that most pleased Mr. Skilling, who wanted Enron to be a fast-growth, technology-oriented trading company.

Enron DIP Financing Continues Sliding Downhill
By Kathy Chu

02/06/2002
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp.'s (ENRNQ) interim financing package continues to slide downhill.
The loan, which was first projected at $1.5 billion, is now expected to be between $250 million to $500 million, according to people familiar with the matter. This debtor-in-possession-financing, or DIP, is supposed to prop up the bankrupt company as it struggles to reorganize. 
But in recent days, lead bankers J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and Citigroup (C) have been hard-pressed to syndicate the loan, as other banks - some grappling with their own exposure to Enron - are reluctant to take on any new Enron financing, according to sources. 
Tuesday, Enron postponed for the fifth time a hearing to consider the final terms of the loan. Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez, of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York, is now expected to consider terms of the deal March 6. 
Under the original agreement, the DIP was conditional on syndication of the financing - which reduces the risks to J.P. Morgan and Citigroup - and the repayment of $550 million in credit extended to Enron by the two financial institutions in November. 
The first DIP installment of $250 million was made available to Enron in early December, but the company has yet to tap the loan. 
"We're not in need of the cash, but it's useful to have a credit facility lined up," said Martin Bienenstock, with Weil Gotshal & Manges law firm, which represents Enron. "We have assets worth billions." 
Bienenstock said DIP lenders are "basically recasting the whole loan" in light of the company's stronger-than-expected cash position. 
In late January, Bienenstock had estimated that Enron had about $1 billion in cash. No updated figure is available, the lawyer said Tuesday. 
Enron also has the promise of an additional cash infusion in the near future. The company is in talks to sell its Wessex Water utility in southwest England, one of its largest international assets. This deal could bring in up to $1.2 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter. 
The close of a sale of Enron's energy-trading business to UBS Warburg is also pending. Under the deal, Enron won't get any cash upfront, but will share in future profits. 
"DIP financing is expensive, so they don't want to sign up for anything they don't need," said a person familiar with the financing. 
The interim loan carries an interest of 350 basis points, or 3.5 percentage points, over the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR. 
The DIP is senior to all loans under the bankruptcy code, giving financial institutions some incentive to extend the loan to a distressed company.

Enron's broadband unit owes back taxes

HOUSTON (AP) - Enron Broadband Services, one of Enron Corp.'s failed business ventures, owes Harris County and other entities about $440,000 in back taxes, according to county officials. 
Enron Broadband Services was an unsuccessful Internet venture that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Dec. 26. It did not notify the county in 2001 that it had nearly $15 million in telecommunications equipment, county Tax Assessor Paul Bettencourt told the Houston Chronicle in Wednesday's editions.
The company neglected to list the equipment in its 2001 taxable property, Bettencourt said. The taxes were due by Jan. 31, 2002. 
Back tax owed to the county tax office is $207,000. About $237,000 is owed to Houston Independent School District, Bettencourt said. 
County records show the company's property tax was $3,600 for 2001. Records indicate that it has not been paid, but the payment may not have been posted yet on the county's Web site, Bettencourt said. 
"This is one of the bigger omitted properties (ever in the county)," he said, though Enron can still appeal the appraised value. 
Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said bankruptcy does not preclude the company from paying taxes. 
"I'm sure if they are appropriate, and if we owe them, we will pay them," Palmer said. 
Bettencourt said his office notified Enron of the oversight and tax due Jan. 31. The firm has 30 days to appeal. If it doesn't, it has 45 days to pay the tax before becoming delinquent. 
Enron created its broadband services unit in 1997, believing it could buy and sell Internet access like a commodity. But the venture reported steep losses each quarter. 
In January 2001, Enron's then-president Jeff Skilling touted the unit's moneymaking potential at a time when its 2,000 employees were having trouble finding customers and the firm was trying to sell its single hard asset, an 18,000-mile fiber-optic data network. 
In April 2001, the unit tried to sell millions of dollars worth of computers and telecommunications equipment stockpiled at a warehouse. That appears to be some of the equipment the firm neglected to pay taxes on in 2001, Bettencourt said.

Enron To Fight Astros Attempt To Get Ballpark Name Back

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) is challenging the Houston Astros' attempt to step up to the plate to reclaim a Texas stadium's naming rights.
Earlier Tuesday, the Astros filed a motion with a New York bankruptcy court, asking a federal judge presiding over Enron's case to force the company to accept or reject a 30-year, $100 million licensing agreement that christened a Houston ballpark "Enron Field." 
If the bankrupt company cannot guarantee future payments - as the Astros believe is the likely case - Enron must immediately end the contract so another buyer can be found, according to the baseball team. 
In court documents, the Astros said that the team's image has been "tainted" by its association with Enron, and that "unique and irreparable harm" will result from any further ties to a company that is alleged to have misled creditors and shareholders. 
But Martin Bienenstock, of Weil Gotshal & Manges, the law firm representing Enron, said that the Astros are just taking a swing at the distressed company's creditors while they're down. 
"It's particularly unfair for them to do this," said Bienenstock, who plans to challenge the motion in upcoming weeks. "They're trying to aggravate the creditors' losses." 
Enron has already paid $10 million under the licensing deal, and will not be able to recoup this amount if the contract is terminated. The company, even after filing for bankruptcy on Dec. 2, has continued to honor its financial obligations to the Astros, according to Bienenstock. 
On Jan. 22, Enron paid the Astros $108,000 for a 14-person luxury suite in the ballpark. Last Monday, the company wrote a check for about $90,000 for 35 season box seats. 
Enron is keeping up with these bills - which are required under the contract - so that later, it may be able to assign the naming rights to a third party and recoup some money for creditors, according to Bienenstock. 
"Even if the license agreement says we can't (assign these rights), the bankruptcy code usually makes transferrable or assignable things that are not outside of bankruptcy," he said. 
The baseball team said it will leave legal interpretations to the bankruptcy judge. 
But even if the contract is terminated, Enron won't be walking away empty-handed, according to Pam Gardner, president of business operations for the Astros, because the bankrupt company has received baseball seats and advertising in exchange for the $10 million it spent. 
"We just want the court to let us know sooner than later (about the contract) so that we can move on with our business," said Gardner. 
Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez, of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York, plans to hear the matter on Feb. 27. 
For now, Enron's decision to keep its name on the stadium may have some value - even if the company doesn't decide to transfer the rights to another party. 
"It makes sense not to burn any bridges for the naming rights," said Joel Kay, a bankruptcy attorney at Hughes, Watters & Askanase LLP in Houston. "It could be valuable depending on what the company looks like when it reorganizes."

Houston - The Houston Astros don't want the name "Enron Field" atop their 2-year-old ballpark. 
"Thousands of people who have been adversely affected by the Enron collapse are being reminded on a daily basis of this continuing tragedy," attorneys for Astros owner Drayton McLane wrote in a motion filed yesterday with the New York court overseeing Enron's bankruptcy.
The team wants the bankruptcy court to force Enron to decide whether to honor the 30-year, $100-million naming rights agreement signed in 1999. The former energy giant's next payment for Enron Field's naming rights is due Aug. 31. The Astros say it isn't realistic to expect Enron to be able to make the $3.7-million payment. 
"The Enron logo displayed on the Stadium wrongly suggests to the public that the Astros are associated with the alleged bad business practices of Enron," the motion states. "As it stands, the Houston Astros arguably are viewed as Enron's team." 
Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said the company's naming rights agreement with the team is a valuable asset the former energy giant is not willing to give up. 
Pam Gardner, Astros president of business operations, said since Enron filed for bankruptcy protection in December, the company has spent about $108,000 for a suite and nearly $90,000 for 2002 season box seats as required in the license agreement. Enron has made three annual payments totaling $10.25 million and is current on its payments, the Astros said. 
Denne says she isn't sure how the team is being harmed. "How good a team they are is determined by how they play on the field, not the name on the stadium," she said.

U.S. labour secretary to testify as hearings continue in Enron collapse
BY MARCY GORDON
AP

The Canadian Press
Copyright (c) 2002 The Canadian Press. All rights reserved.

WASHINGTON (AP) _ The subpoenas are multiplying, the hearings mushrooming in Congress' investigation into the collapse of Enron Corp., a once powerful company transformed into a symbol of American corporate failure. 
``The thought of employees sustaining huge losses while executives were able to sell stock for millions is infuriating,'' Senator Joseph Lieberman said Tuesday. He announced plans to issue a subpoena to get information about bonuses paid to company executives in the run-up to its Dec. 2 bankruptcy.
Lieberman spoke after a laid-off worker tearfully described losing $40,000 US from her retirement account last fall as Enron slid toward collapse. 
The hearings were picking up again Wednesday, with one committee hearing from Labour Secretary Elaine Chao about Bush administration plans to strengthen retirement account protections for millions of workers. Two other panels were to be active as well. 
On Tuesday, Joseph Berardino, chairman of the accounting firm Arthur Andersen, drew the wrath of House of Representatives members over Andersen's handling of Enron and the shredding of documents. 
"You have squandered the integrity of your company,'' Representative Gary Ackerman (D_N.Y.) told him. 
Berardino's response to the criticism: "At the end of the day, we do not cause companies to fail.'' 
As no less than four congressional panels met on the Enron debacle, the Senate Commerce Committee approved a subpoena for Kenneth Lay, the former head of Enron who cancelled plans to appear voluntarily Monday. "We have no choice,'' said Senator Byron Dorgan (D_N.D.). 
Representative Michael Oxley, head of the House banking committee, signed a subpoena for Lay to appear before his panel on Feb. 14, two days after the Senate appearance. 
Lay's lawyer Earl Silbert dismissed any suggestion that Lay was ``making himself scarce'' to avoid investigators. 
Legislators predicted Lay would invoke his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination when he appears. 
A dozen committees are investigating Enron, along with the Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission. The energy-trading company has deep political ties in Washington, and politicians in both parties have scrambled to distance themselves from Enron. 
The Justice Department has rejected calls by some Democrats for a special prosecutor. 
"This is a business problem that our Justice Department is going to investigate, and if there's wrongdoing we'll hold them accountable for mistreatment of employees and shareholders,'' President George W. Bush said Tuesday. 
Millions of investors lost money, and thousands of current and former Enron employees lost the great bulk of their retirement savings, when the company collapsed. An Enron-sponsored investigation released over the weekend blamed senior management for failing to provide proper supervision over a complex web of partnerships that helped the company hide debt and post unrealistic profit figures. 
Once disclosed, the transactions contributed to the company's unravelling. 
The biggest fireworks Tuesday were reserved for Berardino. 
Oxley noted that the Enron internal investigation found active participation by Andersen in setting up the partnerships, and that the accounting firm had received $5.7 million for advice on the subject. 
"You weren't just checking the boxes,'' he told Berardino, who claimed that he wasn't in the loop and that Andersen's auditors didn't actively participate in setting up the partnerships. 
"I did not do the audit of the company,'' Berardino said. "Information was withheld from us.'' 
Lead Enron auditor David Duncan was fired in January, accused by his employer of organizing the destruction of Enron documents. 
The committee also heard testimony about a period of roughly three weeks last fall when individuals were barred from selling any stock in their retirement accounts, a lockout attributed to a change in plan administrators. 
Because the price of Enron stock was dropping at the time, officials debated whether to postpone the lockout, but eventually decided not to. The company found ``it was not feasible to notify more than 20,000 participants in a timely fashion,'' said Cindy Olson, Enron's executive vice-president for human resources. 
Enron's stock peaked at $82 a share on Jan. 26, 2001. It was selling for $15.40 at the close of trading on Oct. 26, the day the lockout began, and had fallen to $9.98 on Nov. 13, the day it ended. 
At another hearing, the author of the withering Enron internal investigation described how the executives ``enriched themselves ... by tens of millions of dollars'' through questionable partnerships.

LAY KNEW THERE WAS TROUBLE, BOARD MEMBER SAYS
CHRIS MONDICS AND DAVE MONTGOMERY, KNIGHT RIDDER NEWSPAPERS

Kenneth Lay, Enron Corp.'s former chief executive officer, had detailed knowledge of deals that presented a misleading picture of the company's finances to the public, the chief author of a scathing internal report told Congress yesterday. 
"It was clear to us that he knew," said Williams Powers Jr., an Enron board member and head of a special committee that investigated several transactions that led to the company's collapse. "I can tell you what his story was -- that he didn't believe there was anything wrong with it, that the accountants had signed off on it."
Powers' testimony before the House of Representatives Energy and Commerce Committee's investigative subcommittee, one of at least 10 panels delving into Enron's fall, challenged Lay's self-portrait of an innocent chief executive isolated from the dealing of subordinates who have drawn much of the blame for the collapse. 
Pressure on Lay intensified yesterday when two congressional committees ordered subpoenas compelling his appearance next week. The 59-year-old former executive abruptly canceled a scheduled appearance Monday before the Senate Commerce Committee, enraging lawmakers and further inflaming the anti-Enron mood on Capitol Hill. 
The House Financial Services Committee ordered Lay to appear Feb. 14. The Senate Commerce Committee had not decided on a date. Several lawmakers speculated that Lay would choose not to testify and invoke Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination. 
Lawmakers of both parties are eager to confront Lay with stories of ordinary citizens who held pensions heavily based on Enron stock only to see their retirement accounts evaporate. Meanwhile, Lay and other top executives made millions of dollars by selling their stock before the company collapsed. 
Powers' report, released over the weekend, concluded that top Enron executives used hundreds of partnerships to conceal losses and overstate profits, enabling the company to show a robust stock performance. 
Yesterday, House investigators said they had learned that former executives Michael J. Kopper and Ben Glisan tried to get a subordinate fired when he protested that one of the partnerships was not in the company's interest. When those threats failed, former Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow, architect of many of the transactions under investigation, left a profanity-laden message on the employee's voice mail, investigators said. 
Several lawmakers said they found it hard to believe that Lay would be unaware of bogus transactions during his stewardship of the company. 
Powers, who also testified Monday, told the House panel that Lay was well aware of several so-called "hedge" transactions, in which the company created an appearance that an independent third party was obligated to cover its losses in the stock market. But, in reality, Enron had a substantial economic stake in the third-party entity, meaning any losses would actually affect Enron's bottom line. 
When the losses came, Enron was forced to restate its earnings, and the resulting loss of investor confidence sent its stock plunging. The company declared bankruptcy Dec. 2. 
In other House testimony yesterday, Andersen Chief Executive Joseph Berardino cast auditors as helpless victims of what he called a "bad system" of financial reporting. 
Berardino tried to cast doubt on the credibility of Powers' report, which faulted the Chicago auditing firm, in part, for Enron's collapse. Berardino said the committee didn't interview Andersen, which signed off on Enron's questionable deals. "We begged them to talk to us," he said.

Probe: Enron issued threats

Washington --- Members of Congress investigating the collapse of Enron said employees of the energy trading giant were threatened when they were too aggressive in representing the company's interests. 
"What we know is that there was a lot of self-dealing going on," said Rep. Billy Tauzin (R-La.). One Enron employee was threatened with firing and others were told their bonuses were endangered if they took too hard a line for the firm in negotiations involving executive-run partnerships outside the company, said Tauzin, head of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. He did not provide details.
The partnerships, run by then-Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow and his subordinate, Michael Kopper, allowed Enron to report profits that didn't exist and to hide debt. 
Enron's stock price collapsed and the Houston company filed for bankruptcy court protection in December after it reversed almost $600 million in profits. 
Fastow and Kopper are to appear before Tauzin's committee on Thursday, as is Jeffrey Skilling, a former Enron chief executive. 
Another House committee and a Senate committee Tuesday subpoenaed Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman and CEO at the time of the collapse. 
In congressional hearings Tuesday: 
> University of Texas law school dean William Powers said Enron executives were making "systematic and pervasive" efforts to keep investors and the board of directors in the dark about the energy company's financial condition and deals that enriched some employees by millions of dollars. Powers, who led an Enron investigation into the partnerships, was testifying for a second day. 
> Joseph Berardino, chief executive of Arthur Andersen, Enron's auditing firm, faced fierce questioning from lawmakers frustrated that he could not explain why the accounting firm failed to detect irregularities. 
Berardino accused Enron of withholding information from the auditors. 
"You have squandered the integrity of your company," Rep. Gary Ackerman (D-N.Y.) told Berardino. "You have enabled the enrichment of the greedy at the price of destroying the dreams of so many decent, innocent people. That is totally unacceptable." 
> Some Enron employees said they received retention bonus shortly before the company's bankruptcy filing, while others recounted their retirement losses. 
Mikie Rath, a benefits manager, said she received a retention bonus "in excess of $20,000." 
On the other hand, Deborah Perrotta said she lost $40,000 in retirement savings. Perrotta, who worked as a senior administrative assistant at Enron, started crying as she told the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee that she could no longer pay for her daughter's wedding. 
"This isn't right," she said. "We worked hard, many of us worked as hard as we possibly could. . . . When Enron told us that its business was sound and its stock was to go up, we believed them." 
Speaking in Pittsburgh, President Bush said Tuesday his administration will fully investigate the Enron case. "If there's wrongdoing, we'll hold them accountable for mistreatment of employees and shareholders," Bush said. 
Meanwhile, members of the Senate Commerce Committee voted to issue a subpoena ordering Lay to testify before them after he refused to appear voluntarily on Monday. His lawyer cited the "prosecutorial" atmosphere in Congress. 
"The Enron ship is at the bottom of the ocean. The only way to get down there and figure out how it sank is to get to the captain," said Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), a member of the Senate panel. 
The House Financial Services Committee also voted to subpoena Lay. Lawmakers acknowledged he may invoke constitutional rights against self-incrimination and refuse to testify. 
"I'll bet you a dollar to a doughnut that Lay won't testify, that he'll invoke his Fifth Amendment right," declared Sen. John Breaux (D- La). 
Lay's attorney, Earl Silbert, said Tuesday that he already received one of the subpoenas. He dismissed any notion that his client was in hiding. There had been reports late Monday and early Tuesday that Lay had disappeared. 
Any suggestion that Lay is "making himself scarce" is "absolute nonsense. He's in Houston with his family," Silbert said. 
Powers, the law school dean who issued a scathing report late Saturday on Enron's partnership deals, told Congress Tuesday that Lay and other top executives failed in their duties by allowing Fastow to create the flawed partnerships or by not exercising proper oversight. 
Powers said Fastow and Kopper cajoled some employees with "extremely abnormal" profits from investments in some of the thousands of partnerships Enron created. 
Enron accountant Ben Glisan Jr. and in-house attorney Kristina Mordaunt were paid about $1 million each in May 2000, within two months after investing $5,800 each in Southampton Place LP, a limited partnership with ties to Kopper and the Fastow Family Foundation, according to Powers' report. The Fastow foundation received $4.5 million from its $25,000 investment in Southampton.

'Enronitis' sufferers won't tolerate creative accounting

Enron the company is an insolvent basket case that almost certainly will not survive in any recognizable form. But the Enron name is destined to live on for many years as the perfect symbol of all that was wrong with the stock market bubble. 
In its next life, Enron will exist solely as a rather nasty noun or verb to describe everything from the conning of employees and shareholders to the pocketing of politicians and the weakening of government regulations.
Already, we have a U.S. senator saying he didn't want "to Enron" Americans. And such endearing terms have crept into our lexicon as "Enronize" -- referring to the rapid vaporization of published profit or surpluses. Example: How did the Bush administration Enronize the budget? 
Then there's "Enronitis" -- the spreading virus among investors who have lost their faith in regulators, auditors, directors and any others in the food chain who are supposed to ensure that the numbers released by companies have some basis in reality. 
Other former darlings of the bubble years played just as fast and loose with those wonderfully elastic accounting rules that too many investors mistakenly trusted for far too long. And most are paying for it dearly now in the public markets. 
Global Crossing has followed Enron into the shelter of bankruptcy court. And like Enron it has belatedly acknowledged that one of its own executives had alleged last summer that the books were being cooked -- although no one thought it important enough to mention this to the auditors or the board of directors. Taking another cue from Enron, the telecom company has appointed a special board committee to look into its own accounting practices. 
If it does uncover accounting irregularities, maybe Global Crossing will get lucky and find a scapegoat as perfect as Andrew Fastow, Enron's greedy former chief financial officer, the architect of its off-balance-sheet vehicles and its whipping boy of choice. 
Tyco International, the General Electric wannabe, has come under a withering attack from equity and debt holders for its own creative accounting and what-they-don't-know-won't-hurt-us approach to public disclosure. The bubble-built empire has just revealed that it spent $8-billion (U.S.) on more than 700 acquisitions over the past three years that it did not consider necessary to disclose separately to the investing public. 
Tyco is on firm legal ground here, having provided the minimum it was required to under existing accounting rules in its filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Most of the deals amounted to less than $50-million each. That isn't regarded as material for a conglomerate with about $36-billion in annual revenue. 
But this isn't the time to be keeping financial information from an investing public that is plainly fed up with being treated as a necessary evil by anything-goes corporate bosses. 
Enron, too, provided what its special committee called "substantial factual information" about its off-balance-sheet dealings in quarterly and annual reports and proxy statements. 
But even though the disclosures were approved by the auditors and lawyers, the committee concluded that they "were obtuse, did not communicate the essence of the transactions completely or clearly and failed to convey the substance of what was going on." 
Oh yes, and the reports didn't bother mentioning that Mr. Fastow had a huge conflict of interest and was raking in millions of dollars on the side. 
After they were so badly burned, who can blame investors who are now fleeing for the hills when they decide that the finances of a particular company are too opaque or the least bit dodgy or simply too complex to be easily digested? And that could sink an exceedingly complicated company like Tyco, which will have to refinance more than $11-billion worth of debt in the next 18 months. 
It may well reach a point where investment pros end up following the lead of those who are used to operating in regions where earnings transparency is as alien as shareholder rights. If, as in Enron's case, you can't even trust the numbers filed quarterly with the SEC or other securities regulators -- the ones that are supposed to conform to generally accepted accounting principles -- how do you evaluate an investment? 
Well, in certain parts of the world that are not widely known for full financial disclosure, good money managers can't afford to take the accounting or the usual financial ratios at face value. They look, instead, at longer-term performance trends, the record of management credibility and for signs of what one emerging markets expert calls "positive change." 
The rule of thumb is always to read the footnotes in the financial statements with extreme care, and treat the comments from company officials as little more than light entertainment. 
At this rate, any North American company that dresses up its financial picture with pro forma accounting (often to exclude such inconvenient items as acquisition costs) or plays other tricks with numbers will find itself hammered mercilessly, even when it has done nothing illegal and has a decent enough track record. 
That will be one of the Enronies of this whole accounting debacle.

USA: US Corp Bonds - "Enronization" tightens its grip.
By Nancy Leinfuss

02/06/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

NEW YORK, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Battered by the Enron contagion, corporate bond spreads have blown out significantly over the last week as investors, fearing they may tread on the next land mine, look to unload corporate debt. 
"It's the Enronization of the market - the perception that there may be other Enrons lurking out there," said one high-grade trader. "The most likely candidate in this market is Tyco, based more on perception than reality," he said.
Mounting accounting concerns at U.S. companies, following the sudden collapse of energy trading giant Enron Corp., and fears over deteriorating corporate credit worth and balance sheets have pushed spreads out by 0.20 to 0.30 percentage point over the last week. 
"There's hysteria right now. It's not rational thinking by investors," said Colin Lundgren, portfolio manager at American Express Asset Management in St. Paul, Minnesota. 
"Taking these companies apart and searching for another Enron out there, we'll find out that there aren't a lot of them," he said. "Maybe some information will come out in terms of accounting issues, but nowhere near the hysteria that seems to built in the market today." 
Spreads - the yield margin between corporate bonds and similar maturity Treasuries - were quoted 0.05 to 0.10 percentage point wider on Wednesday, continuing the trend from the prior week, traders said. 
"Folks are looking for safety and security and the trades don't make sense," said Lundgren, referring to some investors fleeing corporates and jumping into Treasuries. "Some decent companies that will likely surive and be around at the end of the day are just getting beaten over the head with a two-by-four," he said.

MADRID (AFX) - Energy sector regulator Comision Nacional de la Energia (CNE) is planning to investigate Enron Corp's distribution operations in Spain. 
Speaking to reporters, CNE chairman Pedro Merono said the investigation follows electricity pool regulator OMEL's suspension of Enron Espana Energia's operations in December.
But he stressed that this (investigation) "is only related to Enron Espana's distribution activity... It has nothing to do with its generation business."

The spotlight of the Enron Corp. investigators is moving to the company's outside help: the lobbyists, consultants and board members who lent the mantle of respectability to what turns out not to have been respectable. 
The outcome is likely to be the usual: more laws. But it is not clear that even a mountain of legislation can prevent the sort of failure we see in the Enron case. The wrongness, and stupidity, of putting your reputation at risk in exchange for a big fee is the kind of gut knowledge that every professional should carry around in his or her head.
The same holds for recognizing what constitutes a huge conflict of interest--especially if you are in a self-regulated field, such as accountancy. 
Partners at Anderson appear to have ended up ignoring what Michael Groom of Britain's Institute of Chartered Accountants calls "the sniff factor." When something is right by the books, but wrong by the nose, you have to trust the nose. 
Even your average lowlife knows that. Indeed, the ethics of professional service were laid out by a lowlife: Philip Marlowe, the down-and-dirty detective of Raymond Chandler's novels. 
In "The Big Sleep," Marlowe follows a three-stage process of client management that might have helped Enron's friends to avoid their own Big Sleep of inattention. 
- First, establish your fee. Make it standard. That is vital because it helps you to keep your independence. Consider Marlowe on his own rate card. "For 25 bucks a day and expenses, mostly gasoline and whiskey, I do my thinking myself, what there is of it; I risk my whole future, the hatred of the cops and of Eddie Mars and his pals, I dodge bullets and eat saps, and say: `Thank you very much, if you have any more trouble, I hope you'll think of me. I'll just leave one of my cards in case anything comes up.'" 
- Second, beware your own greed. Life has not treated Marlowe the way he deserves. He has a small office, no secretary and an unhealthy fondness for cigarettes and double scotches. Like some of the advisers who served Enron, he nurses that most treacherous of resentments, the resentment of the underappreciated talent. What a life that talent could live if only it were paid what it deserved! 
Marlowe is therefore sorely tempted when approached by the detective's equivalent of Enron: a millionaire's daughter in a pair of oyster-colored pajamas. It does not help that those pajamas come trimmed with white fur. He even dreams aloud about what he might do with her cash: "I could own a home and a new car and four suits of clothes," he tells her. "I might even take a vacation without worrying about losing a case." 
- Third, when someone wants to make you a generous payment--in Andersen's case, fees for consultancy as well as auditing--ask why. "Now you offer me 15 grand. That makes me a big shot," Marlowe says to Vivian Regan on her chaise lounge. The exorbitant rate somehow confirms one's own dream of one's worth. But is it realistic? Marlowe is man enough to put down his cigarette and ask: "What are you offering it to me for?" And to collect his hat and walk out on the oyster-colored pajamas. 
"What are you offering it to me for?" is the big question, the one that many who connected with Enron as consultants or lobbyists failed to pursue sufficiently. The danger is that when we trade away something beyond our standard handiwork, that something is usually our professional reputation. 
That reputation is so precious--even to Marlowe--that he turns down a second wild lady, Vivian's sister Carmen: "It's a question of professional pride. You know-- professional pride. I'm working for your father." 
Useful corollaries to Marlowe's list might include: "If you don't know, find out. If you can't find out, say so." Jeffrey Skilling, Enron's chief executive, was a notoriously dismissive boss; in the public space of conference calls, he scolded investment analysts who queried his complex accounting methods. Enron made it so difficult and painful for analysts to research the company more deeply that most of them failed to do so. 
Of course, no professional with a career behind him can say he did the right thing every time. Marlowe could not. Dashiell Hammett's Sam Spade was frank about this in "The Maltese Falcon." "We didn't exactly believe your story, Miss O'Shaughnessy; we believed your $200 . . . I mean, you paid us more than if you'd been telling us the truth, and enough more to make it all right." 
Still, we can all strive to do better, just like those bottom- feeders in the world of the 1930s detective (a "self-regulating" place if there ever was one). And when a too-luscious offer materializes before us, we could do worse than ask ourselves Marlowe's big question: "What are you offering it to me for?"

Sour Note? Here's What Happens To Whistleblowers After They Sound Off --- For Some Future Employers, Integrity Trumps Corporate Loyalty
By Joann S. Lublin

Enron Corp. executive Sherron Watkins never intended to become a whistle-blower by helping expose the practices that triggered her company's financial collapse. 
When Jeffrey Skilling, president of the Houston energy concern, abruptly quit in August, Enron officials set up a special letter-collection box so employees could anonymously vent their worries. Ms. Watkins, vice president for corporate development, wrote an unsigned, one-page note to then-Chairman Kenneth Lay. "Has Enron become a risky place to work?" her letter asked, after questioning its irregular accounting methods.
"I am incredibly nervous that we will implode in a wave of accounting scandals," she continued. "My eight years of Enron will be worth nothing on my resume." 
Nothing may be further from the truth. Ms. Watkins's subsequent experience suggests that whistle-blowing need not blow your career. Informers about workplace misdeeds can minimize career damage if they enjoy a strong reputation for honesty, management experts and former whistle-blowers say. 
Ms. Watkins, 42 years old, has been lauded for her courage since a House of Representatives committee investigating Enron released an expanded version of her letter last month. Her reluctant internal disclosure "is going to be terrific for her career. It shows profound integrity and discretion," says Hal Reiter, CEO of New York recruiters Herbert Mines Associates. 
Though many whistle-blowers get forced out after going public, Enron's mess offers Ms. Watkins some job security. Even so, blowing the whistle within Enron "wasn't an easy thing to do," says Philip Hilder, a Houston attorney representing Ms. Watkins and speaking on her behalf. 
Ms. Watkins, shortly after writing the letter, accepted a colleague's suggestion to divulge her identity and meet with Mr. Lay, where she detailed her concerns. That session prompted the company to invite a law firm's investigation. Enron filed for bankruptcy Dec. 2. 
Why didn't Ms. Watkins protect co-workers by alerting the SEC, asks Jeffrey Wigand. He is the research executive who blew the whistle on alleged wrongdoing by his former employer, Brown & Williamson Tobacco. He became an educator at one-tenth his former $300,000 salary. Keeping complaints in-house "minimizes your career damage . . . as well as minimizes your integrity," he believes. 
Ms. Watkins didn't contact securities regulators because she was challenging accounting practices approved by Enron lawyers and accountants, Mr. Hilder replies. 
In Asia, whistle-blowing is less common. Many companies are tightly-knit family-run enterprises that share little internal information with their employees. Asian executive recruiters and management consultants point out that those senior employees who do have access to such information are often bound to their employees through family or clan links, making whistle-blowing almost tantamount to personal betrayal. 
In 1981, Jerry Giordano, then a 37-year-old marketing director, caused an internal ruckus but didn't inform authorities when he found what he says were unlawful pricing practices at a small West Coast industrial-products manufacturer. To make old products appear new, he says, the maker repackaged them, falsified engineering specifications and ordered him to pitch them before salespeople. A former Federal Trade Commission official advised him the small business wouldn't likely be prosecuted. 
Mr. Giordano confided his dilemma to a friend he had worked for at a defense contractor. The former boss had commended his integrity when he exposed hidden cost overruns at their former company. Both left for other jobs. "He created a job for me" at his new employer, he says. 
Good thing. Before he could resign, he was fired for sending a memo to colleagues about the company's packaging practices that concluded "being indicted looks bad on your resume." Mr. Giordano, now the 58-year-old CEO of Criterium-Mooney Engineers, civil-engineering consultants in Portland, Maine, would gladly hire Ms. Watkins. "She did the right thing by going to the top," he says. 
At the moment, Mr. Hilder says, Ms. Watkins isn't thinking about whether her internal whistle-blowing might harm her career. "If the time ever comes when she needs to seek employment, she will rest on her abilities," the attorney insists. 
Barbara Provus, a principal of Chicago recruiters Shepherd Bueschel & Provus, is skeptical. "Very few companies really want a corporate conscience," she says. 
Renwick T. Nelson learned that lesson after exposing allegedly deceptive life-insurance sales practices at Prudential Financial. He gave a sworn anonymous statement to Florida's attorney general in 1996 before he switched jobs at Prudential, from top marketing-practices officer to a $300,000-a-year post as a compliance officer. But he was fired in March 1997, according to his Dec. 5 testimony in a Miami federal court case stemming from the allegations. 
Following his dismissal, Mr. Nelson sent out numerous resumes -- and never got any interviews. He has a hunch why. "Senior management in the corporate world seems to think they are owed complete loyalty and whistle-blowing indicates that you may be loyal to something else," he says. 
Since July 2000, the 57-year-old has been a U.S. Peace Corps volunteer in Tonga, happily teaching business-writing on the South Pacific island. What career guidance would he offer Ms. Watkins? "She will feel isolated and vilified, but ultimately she will know that what she did was right. Nothing can diminish that knowledge."

Enron, cows and a whole lot of bull.
By Pratap Ravindran.

MUMBAI, Feb. 5 
WHEN Enron went boom, a good many people got singed in the hip pocket - but the falling debris also hit a lot of folks in the funny bone.
Thus, a popular bulletin board on the Net seeks to define the difference between traditional capitalism and Enron capitalism. 
In traditional capitalism, you start off with two cows. You sell one and buy a bull. Your herd multiplies and the economy grows. You sell them and retire on the income. 
With capitalism Enron style, you again start off with two cows. You sell three of them to your publicly listed company, using letters of credit opened by your brother-in-law at the bank, then execute a debt-equity swap with an associated general offer so that you can get all four cows back, with a tax exemption for five cows. The milk rights of the six cows are transferred through an intermediary to a Cayman Island company secretly owned by the majority shareholder who sells the rights to all seven cows back to your listed company. The Enron annual report says the company owns eight cows, with an option on one more.... 
And then there's Dave Barry (Knight Ridder Tribune) who has sought to explain the Enron collapse, using simple financial terms (such as dirtballs), for the benefit of the average layperson whose grasp of high finance consists of knowing his or her ATM code. It's in a Q&A format and goes like this (extracts): 
Q. How, exactly, did Enron make money? 
A. Nobody knows. This is usually the case with corporations whose names sound like fictional planets from Star Wars. Allegedly, Enron was in the energy business, but when outside investigators finally looked into it, they discovered that the only actual energy source in the entire Enron empire was a partially used can of Sterno in the basement of corporate headquarters. Using a financial technique called "leveraging," Enron executives were able to turn this asset into a gigantic enterprise whose stock was valued at billions of dollars. 
Q. What does "leveraging" mean? 
A. Lying. 
Q. Why didn't Wall Street realise that Enron was a fraud? 
A. Because Wall Street relies on "stock analysts." These are people who do research on companies and then, no matter what they find, even if the company has burned to the ground, enthusiastically recommend that investors buy the stock. They are just a bunch of cockeyed optimists. When the Titanic was in its deathly throes, with the propellers sticking straight up in the air, there was a stock analyst clinging to the railing, asking people around him where he could buy a ticket for the return trip. 
Q. So the analysts gave Enron a favourable rating? 
A. Oh, yes. Enron stock was rated "Can't Miss" until it became clear that the company was in desperate trouble, at which point analysts lowered the rating to "Sure Thing." 
Only when Enron went completely under did a few bold analysts demote its stock to the lowest possible Wall Street rating, "Hot Buy." 
Dave Barry gets in a dig against the Enron directors too: 
Q. Doesn't Enron have a board of directors whose members are responsible for overseeing the corporation? 
A. Yes. They are paid $3,00,000 a year. 
Q. So how could they have allowed this flagrant deception to go on? 
A. They are paid $300,000 a year. And then there are the Jay Leno-isms: 
"It was cold today. I was rubbing my hands together more than Dick Cheney at an Enron payday;" 
"People are still talking about President Bush's big State of the Enron, I mean, Union, speech;" and 
"Dick Cheney finally responded today to demands that he reveal the details of the Enron meetings. This is what he said. He met with unnamed people, from unspecified companies, for an indeterminate period of time at an undisclosed location. Thank God he cleared that up. I'm ready to move on..." 
The last word to David Letterman: "Enron CEO Kenneth Lay has sold all of his Enron stock. I guess we all know that. In fact, the only thing he owns now is the Bush Administration."

Satire
Ken Lay's un-American activities
There is only one force that could be responsible for this man's undermining of the capitalist system!
- - - - - - - - - - - -
By Andrew Leonard
Feb. 6, 2002 | My fellow congressional leaders, a specter is haunting America -- the specter of Enron. A gang of economic terrorists, cloaking their activities under the guise of "innovation" and "deregulation," has undermined the basic principles upon which the economy of the United States is founded. 
A glance at the falling stock market proves that a nation's trust in quarterly earnings reports has been shaken. No longer can we look to Wall Street for an honest appraisal of corporate health. Worst of all, decades of work devoted to freeing markets from the unhealthy influence of heavy-handed government intervention have been undermined by a band of renegades. 
And as if that wasn't enough, the leader of this pirate mob has now committed his greatest indignity against the American people -- former Enron CEO Ken Lay is refusing to defend his actions before Congress. He may even follow the lead of his former employees, Andrew Fastow and Michael Kopper, and hide behind the protection of the Fifth Amendment. 
Not since the Hollywood Ten refused to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee has this nation witnessed such a brazen display of impudent pusillanimity. Let us recall -- even Oliver North had the guts to defend his actions before Congress. But of course, Oliver North is a true patriot, dedicated to defending the values that make this country great, whereas Ken Lay and company apparently care little about how vigorously they are dragging the American flag through the mud. 
Some of my esteemed colleagues have made the feeble, and obviously political, argument that Ken Lay is no villain, but merely a symptom of larger, systemic problems. They would have us believe that Enron's excesses are a result of deregulation, and that the greed of Enron's executives is a natural corollary to a political ethos that holds tax cuts as the highest public good and exalts the maximization of profits as the sublimest expression of civic duty. While they might agree that Ken Lay's actions are unethical and possibly illegal, they see his behavior as a consequence of decades of special-interest lobbying and not as a gross departure from acceptable entrepreneurial standards. 

To this I cry, "Have you no shame?" To turn the Enron debacle into a political football is vile demagoguery. It is an insult to every chief executive who has ever succeeded in steering his company to 20 percent annual growth and to every stock investor who has earned windfall profits from an IPO. To draw attention to Mr. Lay's political connections in the service of partisan bickering is nothing but a mockery of justice, and an attempt to disguise the perfidiousness that is at the core of Enron. I ask you, my fellow leaders, do not besmirch the capitalist ethic with the stain of Enron. No, our task here is far more important than the scoring of legislative points. 
In this perilous age for our nation, we must be as alert to attacks from within as from without. It would be all too easy to focus so attentively on the axis of evil binding North Korea, Iran and Iraq together that we miss the equally challenging dangers posed by domestic villains. That is why I am calling today for the reestablishment of the House Un-American Activities Committee. For there is obviously nothing more un-American than Ken Lay. Is there a pillar of the American economy that has not been tarnished by Ken Lay? 
?	Enron has single-handedly ruined the reputation of one of our finest accounting firms -- Arthur Andersen -- and by extension, cast grave doubt on the entire accounting industry's ability to serve as its own watchdog, or anyone else's.
?	Enron's behavior will no doubt encourage American citizens to lose their faith in hardworking and honest Wall Street analysts. Imagine the economic chaos if every buy recommendation is suddenly interpreted as an encouragement to sell!
?	Enron has reduced the reliability of the business press to tatters. A generation of fine reporters and editors are no doubt heartsick and ulcer-ridden after being seduced by the siren song of Ken Lay's velvet eloquence.
?	Enron has besmirched the integrity of both political parties. When everyone from Jesse Jackson to George W. Bush turns out to have supped at the Enron trough, the American people can be readily excused for thinking that all politicians are bought and paid for.
Again, my colleagues would have you believe in their absurd notion that all politicians really are merely the pawns of their campaign contributors. Even more audaciously, they will stand here and thunder until their throats grow hoarse that the business press, Wall Street and the accounting industry are all equally to blame for the Enron mess, and that all of these problems are the fault of our elected leadership. The system, they whine incessantly, is broken. Greed is the only law of the land, they whimper. 

Piffle! The litany of crimes committed by Ken Lay and his associates is too great to be explained away by the petty motivators of greed or avarice, and too evil to be blamed on the ludicrous bogeyman of "the system." No, my fellow Americans, it is clear that there is something far more insidious at work here. The damage wreaked against capitalism by Enron is so vast, so troubling in its extent and so awesome in its comprehensiveness, that we must look elsewhere for answers. 

The American people demand those answers. Ken Lay's lawyer says he doesn't know his current whereabouts. Such delinquence is unacceptable! He must be brought before the highest elected officials of this land, whether it be of his own free will or hauled before a new, revived HUAC in leg irons and handcuffs. 

He must be called to account, and when he does appear before Congress, God help him if he dares hide behind the Constitution when confronted with the obvious, pressing question of the day: 

"Sir, are you now, or have you ever been, a member of the Communist Party?"

Secretaries Say Enron Had Them Pose As Traders In 1998
By Jason Leopold

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- Some current and former employees of Enron Energy Services, the retail energy unit of Enron Corp. (ENRNQ), say the company asked them to pose as busy electricity and natural gas sales representatives one day in 1998 so the Enron unit could impress Wall Street analysts visiting its Houston headquarters.
More than a dozen former and current Enron Energy Services staff who spoke to Dow Jones Newswires said Enron executives rushed about 75 employees, including secretaries and actual sales representatives, down to an empty trading floor on the sixth floor and told them to act as if they were trying to sell energy contracts to businesses over the phone. 
"When we went down to the sixth floor, I remember we had to take the stairs so the analysts wouldn't see us," said Kim Garcia, who at the time was an administrative assistant for Enron Energy Services and was laid off last December. "We brought some of our personal stuff, like pictures, to make it look like the area was lived in. There were a bunch of trading desks on the sixth floor, but the desks were totally empty. Some of the computers didn't even work, so we worked off of our laptops. When the analysts arrived, we had to make believe we were on the phone buying and selling electricity and natural gas. The whole thing took like 10 minutes." 
Penny Marksberry - who also worked as an Enron Energy Services administrative assistant in 1998 and was laid off last December - and two employees who still work at the unit also said they were told to act as if they were trying to sell contracts. 
"They actually brought in computers and phones and they told us to act like we were typing or talking on the phone when the analysts were walking through," Marksberry said. "They told us it was very important for us to make a good impression and if the analysts saw that the operation was disorganized, they wouldn't give the company a good rating." 

Enron Confirms Employees Moved 

Peggy Mahoney, Enron Energy Services' spokeswoman, confirmed that some employees were told to move to sixth floor so it would appear to be occupied and busy for a visit by 150 analysts from Wall Street firms who were in town for a convention. 
But she said it was just a handful of employees who went down to the sixth floor, not 75, and that the company didn't ask anyone to pose as traders or sales representatives. 
"We weren't trying to mislead anyone," Mahoney said. "There were some employees who were moved down there. They were told to just sit there. I don't know why. Analysts were brought in, and we showed them our operation. We were just showing them how we structured deals and contracts." 
Mahoney couldn't confirm the exact date of the analyst visit, but said it happened as the unit was in the middle of signing a contract with General Cable. Enron announced that deal on June 30, 1998. 
One analyst based in Houston recalled the visit to Enron's headquarters, where analysts were bused following a meeting at the Four Seasons hotel in June 1998. Analysts were led around by Ken Lay, then Enron's chairman and chief executive, and the EES floor appeared busy with actual work, he said. 
"The big push then was EES and retail electricity in California," the analyst said, asking that his name be withheld because his bank still conducts business with Enron. "The trading floor looked fully staffed. There was a presentation in a little auditorium right where EES was operating. It looked like people were very busy. We didn't interact with any of the employees on the floor." 
A number of the other analysts currently covering Enron weren't following the company in 1998. Of those that were, some didn't recall the specific company visit or weren't available for comment. 

Need To Show 'Warm Bodies Working' 

Enron Energy Services was set up in late 1997 to sell energy and advisory services to large consumers that had been freed or were expected to be freed from their local utilities by newly minted deregulation laws. 
The unit was still small in 1998. Some of its employees shared space with other units on the ninth floor, and others were spread throughout the building while the sixth floor was being fashioned as a permanent home, employees said. 
Enron executives including Lay escorted the analysts through the floor and returned later to tell the employees that they had done a good job, said Garcia, the administrative assistant. 
"I think a bunch of us asked him why did we just do this, and he said the analysts needed to see a bunch of warm bodies working so Enron could get a good credit rating," Garcia said. "He said the trading part of Enron was the company's bread and butter." 
Earl Silbert, a lawyer representing Lay, declined to comment specifically on the employees' claims, saying they didn't deserve a response. 
Last week, the House Energy and Commerce Committee released a memo e-mailed to Lay in August 2001 warning that Enron Energy Services' financial results were being misrepresented. The memo was sent by Margaret Ceconi, who worked for the unit for nine months. 
Mahoney said at the time the memo "does not represent all the facts." 
A bankruptcy court judge allowed Enron to drop hundreds of Energy Service contracts, but the company has taken extraordinary measures to keep many of the remaining deals alive, an indication many of the unit's contracts remain profitable.

USA: Substantial illegal Enron activity found-Tauzin.

02/06/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

WASHINGTON, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Congressional investigators have uncovered "substantial evidence of illegal activity" by the now-bankrupt Enron Corp. and its management, Rep. Billy Tauzin, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said on Wednesday. 
"This activity served to deceive the public about Enron's financial condition," Tauzin, a Louisiana Republican, said in prepared remarks opening a hearing to probe the collapse of the former energy giant and the actions by its auditor Andersen.
Enron's auditor "knew or should have discovered the fraudulent nature" of certain transactions with outside partnerships managed by former Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, he said. 
"We have found that Enron's financial statements violated numerous existing accounting rules," Tauzin said.

FASB To Discuss Off-Balance-Sheet Entities Next Week

02/06/2002
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The Financial Accounting Standards Board plans to discuss the issue of accounting for a controversial type of off-balance-sheet entity at its Feb. 13 meeting, the board said Wednesday. 
In the schedule for the meeting, the accounting rulemaker said it will discuss issues related to identifying and accounting for "special-purpose entities," or SPEs - partnerships which currently don't have to be consolidated with the rest of a company's balance sheet even though the company may have effective control over them.
The board said it "will consider various approaches to dealing with SPE situations" and will consider expanding its work to address accounting and disclosure by "the issuer of guarantees of the indebtedness of others." 
The issue of accounting for SPEs has come to the fore because of their prominent role in the Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) scandal. Enron used SPEs, some controlled by its own executives, to move assets and debt off its balance sheet and thus improve its financial results; the now-bankrupt company later reconsolidated some of the SPEs into its balance sheet, which reduced its previously reported earnings by $586 million. 
Companies can form non-consolidated SPEs apart from their balance sheets even though outside investors might provide as little as 3% of the entities' capitalization. The FASB has tried for years to tighten the requirements for when such entities should be consolidated with the rest of companies' operations, but in the past companies have successfully fought any changes. 
The FASB has said it hopes to release new draft rules for accounting for SPEs this spring.

US Rep Tauzin says Congress has learned 'of theft by insiders' at Enron

02/06/2002
AFX News
(c) 2002 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

WASHINGTON (AFX) - House Energy and Commerce Committee chairman Billy Tauzin said his committee's investigation of Enron Corp has now uncovered "self-dealing transactions" by senior Enron management, violations of securities laws as well as "theft by insiders". 
Tauzin revealed the findings in a committee hearing which is investigating Enron's collapse.
"In the end, it turns out that the Enron debacle is an old-fashioned example of theft by insiders, and a failure by those responsible for them to prevent that theft," Tauzin said. 
In a list of new findings, the committee has found that senior Enron executives engaged in self-dealing transactions. 
The committe said that company executives reported "fictitious gains" on partnerships controlled by former chief financial officer Andrew Fastow and others associated with the company, which helped to artificially pump up Enron's stock price and "allowed the same executives to enrich themselves with sales of Enron stock." 
The committee findings also levelled significant criticism at former Enron auditor Arthur Andersen LLP. 
"We have also found that Enron's auditor, Andersen, knew or should have discovered the fraudulent nature of the Fastow transactions," Tauzin said, adding that these transactions "clearly violated existing law and the most basic norms of corporate behaviour." 
The committee has subpoenaed Fastow to appear tomorrow to give evidence on his role in Enron's collapse. But committee staff said they expect the former Enron executive to plead the fifth amendment, which would prevent him from answering questions that could incriminate himself.

UBS to Start Energy Trading Soon After Hiring Enron Workers
2002-02-06 13:32 (New York)

     New York, Feb. 6 (Bloomberg) -- UBS AG said it expects to complete this week its purchase of Enron Corp.'s energy trading business, which will resume electricity and natural gas transactions that all but dried up after Enron's bankruptcy.
     About 625 Enron traders, technicians and back-office workers are preparing to buy and sell energy contracts for UBS, though no date has been set, UBS spokesman David Walker said. Enron traders have been contacting former customers and lining up credit agreements that UBS will need to complete transactions.
     The energy-trading business won't come close to equaling the $43.4 billion in revenue it generated for Enron in the third quarter, before its collapse, Enron traders said. Many customers were burned by the Dec. 2 bankruptcy and have since taken their business to competitors such as Intercontinental Exchange Inc.
     "It's going to be an uphill battle to build confidence,'' said Jim Walker, a senior analyst at Forrester Research, a consulting firm in Cambridge, Massachusetts. "The market's already operating fairly efficiently. It will be a challenge to offer better deals (than Intercontinental) and still make a living.''
     The move to UBS has revived morale for the Enron traders, who watched as 4,500 of their fellow employees at the company's Houston headquarters lost their jobs shortly after the bankruptcy filing, which was the largest ever.
     "We're all excited about moving on from the whole Enron thing, and that we'll be back trading soon,'' said Tom Martin, director of Texas natural gas trading at Enron. "It'll take some time for people to get used to doing business with us. I'm sure there will be some residual effects of what happened at Enron.''

Bankruptcy Sale

     UBS won a bankruptcy auction for Enron's dormant trading business in January. Under the bid, which was approved by a U.S. bankruptcy judge on Jan. 18, UBS would pay Enron a royalty of 33 percent of pretax profit from the trading business. UBS also agreed to pay $5 million of the $11 million in retention bonuses promised to Enron's gas and power employees.
     "We expect the deal to close by the end of the week,'' said David Walker, the UBS spokesman. The energy-trading business, which will be based in Houston and called UBS Warburg Energy, "should be up and running soon afterward.''
     Shares of UBS, a Switzerland's largest banks, fell 1.85 Swiss francs to 73 francs ($43.10). The stock is down 12 percent since Jan. 11, when UBS submitted the highest bid for Enron's energy- trading business.
     The royalties may be worth $1 billion to $2 billion to Enron over the next several years, according to Blackstone Group LP, a private merchant-banking firm hired to help Enron restructure while it tries to emerge from bankruptcy. The liquidation value of the business would have been less than $50 million, the firm estimated.

Enron Obligations

     Some creditors' groups had argued that UBS's bid would force Enron to bear a disproportionate share of the cost and risk of getting the trading business going again.
     There was no guarantee that other energy-trading firms would want to do business with the new entity, Dallas-based bankruptcy lawyer David M. Bennett, who represents a group of creditors, said at the bankruptcy hearing.
     As of Sept. 30, banks, utilities and power companies were owed more than $19 billion by Enron in past trades and contracts for future commodity deliveries, according to Standard & Poor's.
     With so much money still owed them, some companies may be reluctant to do business with Enron's successor, even with a new name and the backing of UBS, said Jim Walker, the analyst at Forrester Research.
     Enron's former trading partners also have gotten used to trading elsewhere.

Rivals Gain

     Officials at the Intercontinental Exchange say trading has doubled in its markets to a nominal value of $4 billion a day in the past three months, fueled partly by transactions from former Enron customers. Intercontinental, based in Atlanta, is owned by companies such as BP Plc, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. and American Electric Power Co.
     To convince traders to return, UBS will have to offer higher prices for sellers and lower prices for buyers than its rivals, which would keep profits thin, Forrester's Walker said.
     In some ways, UBS will be starting with a fresh slate. Enron's book of energy contracts, many of which have been canceled and written off as losses by its trading partners, belongs to the Enron estate, said Martin, the former Enron trader who will be moving to UBS.
     Martin has been spending some of his time in the past week contacting former customers about setting up credit agreements with UBS.

No Enron Link

     "After a short period of time people will realize we have nothing to do with Enron,'' he said. "We won't be as big a player as we were, but I think we can get to be a pretty significant player'' during the next six months to a year.
     Enron's energy-trading unit was profitable before the bankruptcy and wasn't responsible for the company's downfall, Martin said.
     Enron used special partnerships controlled by its executives to keep debt off its books, which helped hide losses in other businesses, according to company officials, government documents and congressional investigators.

Enron's Lay Told Investigators He Felt 'Betrayed'
2002-02-06 14:45 (New York)

     Washington, Feb. 6 (Bloomberg) -- Former Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay told investigators for the company's board that senior executives had "betrayed'' him in setting up partnerships that hid the energy trader's debt.
     Lay, who denied to investigators any criminal wrongdoing, said he gave former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow too much leeway in creating the partnerships, said William Powers, head of the board committee that on Saturday released a report about Enron's collapse.
     "He felt he had not been watching carefully enough,'' Powers told a subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee yesterday. "He felt he had been betrayed.''
     Lawmakers questioned Powers in an attempt to piece together who contributed to Enron's Dec. 2 filing of the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history and wiping out the retirement savings of thousands of employees. Power repeated the conclusions of his report, which blamed everyone from Lay to the board of directors and Arthur Andersen LLP for not questioning partnerships that concealed more than $1 billion in losses.
     "The tragic consequences of the related-party transactions and accounting errors were the result of failures at many levels and by many people,'' according to a summary of the report. The Enron culture "appears to have encouraged pushing the limits.''

Aggressive Style

     In his testimony, Powers said Fastow's aggressive style cowed other executives into approving partnerships from which he made $30 million.
     "They were unwilling to stand up to Andy Fastow,'' he said.
     Powers was appointed as an Enron director in November to lead an investigation at the board's request. He told the committee he expects to leave the board.
     The House Energy and Commerce Committee is subpoenaing Fastow and Michael Kopper, a former Enron executive involved in the partnerships, to appear tomorrow on Capitol Hill, said Ken Johnson, a spokesman for the panel, which is overseeing one of 10 congressional investigations. Fastow and Kopper are expected to invoke their Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination and not testify, he said.
     Jeffrey Skilling, who resigned as chief executive in August, is expected to answer the panel's questions, Johnson said.
     The committee is seeking to have Lay testify before the end of the month, Johnson said. Two other congressional panels have issued subpoenas to Lay after he canceled an appearance set for Monday, citing prejudicial comments from lawmakers.
     The commerce panel voted today to give its chairman, Representative Billy Tauzin, broad authority to subpoena any other executive of Enron or Andersen during the investigation into Enron's collapse.
     The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department also are looking into what happened at Enron as more lawmakers said that executives probably broke the law.
     "It's an old story,'' Tauzin, a Louisiana Republican, said yesterday. ``It's a story of inside theft.''

Labor secretary testifies at Enron hearings 
By MARCY GORDON 
Associated Press 
Feb. 6, 2002, 11:24AM
WASHINGTON -- Responding to the Enron collapse, Labor Secretary Elaine Chao today told Congress that President Bush's proposal to revamp pension laws would strengthen retirement account protections for millions of workers. 
Bush is asking Congress give workers greater flexibility to diversify their company savings accounts, aiming to prevent another Enron-style meltdown. Thousands of Enron employees lost their retirement savings as the company stock plummeted and they were barred from selling it from their investment accounts. 
"We must strengthen the confidence of the American workforce that their retirement savings are secure," Chao testified at a hearing by the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. "We must accomplish this without unnecessarily limiting employers' willingness to establish and maintain plans for their workers or employees' freedom to direct their own savings." 
Although some changes in pension laws are needed, the system is not irreparably broken and is in fact a great success story, Chao said. 
The president's plan also would require employers to give workers quarterly statements with detailed information on their accounts and their rights to diversify holdings, Chao noted. 
Chao spoke as subpoenas multiplied and hearings mushroomed in Congress' investigation into the collapse of Enron Corp., a once-powerful company transformed into a symbol of corporate failure. 
Across the Capitol, the Senate Judiciary Committee heard testimony from legal and labor experts on how to prevent similar future scandals. Proposals included requiring more disclosure from accountants and capping the amount of money that bankrupt corporations can shield from creditors. 
Such changes would require vast revisions to bankruptcy and other laws, and there was disagreement early in the hearing over how best to do that. "You can't legislate against greed, but you can stop greed from succeeding," said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., the panel's chairman. 
Washington state Attorney General Christine Gregoire told the panel that Enron's conduct amounted to "a perfect storm" that rained financial loss and fraud on thousands of investors. 
"They assumed the seventh largest company in America was playing by the rules," Gregoire said. "In the end, they found themselves ripped off just like the naive person who lost money in a pyramid scheme." 
At the hearing on pension law changes, Rep. George Miller of California, the committee's senior Democrat, said the Enron case shows how workers' retirement savings can be jeopardized if employees' rights and protections are inadequate. "Today's outdated pension rules are putting employee nest eggs at risk," he said. 
Enron's human resources executives have said employees were frozen out of their accounts for 11 trading days while the company switched 401(k) plan administrators. 
As the lockout period approached and Enron's stock continued to plummet, Enron managers considered delaying the switch and the lockout period so employees would not be frozen out of their accounts. 
"We considered postponing, but found it was not feasible to notify more than 20,000 participants in a timely fashion," Mikie Rath, Enron's benefits manager, told the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee on Tuesday. 
An employee "told me my timing was horrible, which I agreed with," Rath said. 
Enron's stock peaked at $82 a share on Jan. 26, 2001. It was selling for $15.40 at the close of trading on Oct. 26, the day the lockout began, and had fallen to $9.98 on Nov. 13, the day it ended. 
A dozen committees are investigating Enron, along with the Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission. The energy-trading company has deep political ties in Washington, and politicians in both parties have scrambled to distance themselves from Enron. 


Chao: US Pension Laws Need Reform; Warns Of Going Too Far

OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Labor Secretary Elaine Chao Wednesday told Congress the collapse of Enron highlights the need to update the nation's pension laws but warned of going too far.
In testimony before the House Education and Workforce Committee, Chao said Enron's collapse has "revealed the need for stronger safeguards to protect workers." 
Enron's stock price sharply fell last year before the firm filed for bankruptcy protection in December, wiping out much of the retirement savings of the company's workers. 
But, Chao said, approving legislation that would limit the amount of employer stock that can be placed in workers' 401(k) and other retirement accounts was a bad idea. 
"While it may be tempting to go down this road in the wake of recent business failures, this would actually take away from workers the right to choose, which they deserve," she said. "Arbitrary limits on workers' investment choices would not be progress; it would be turning back the clock." 
Instead, Chao urged Congress to approve legislation incorporating the plan outlined last week by President George W. Bush designed to update the 1974 Employee Retirement Income Security Act. 
The Bush administration and lawmakers agree the law known as ERISA needs updating because it was primarily designed to cover pension plans in which the employer controlled the investments. While some firms still offer such traditional pension plans, most companies offer workers 401(k) and other retirement plans in which the employee is primarily responsible for investment decisions. More than 42 million Americans have 401(k) retirement plans. 
The Bush plan would require employers to offer their employees impartial investment advice, allow employers to sell company stock after three years, subject company executives to the same so-called blackout periods as employees, and require companies to give employees quarterly statements of retirement plan performances. 
Most lawmakers agree that employees need better access to investment advice, which would highlight the need to ensure that retirement assets are diversified. More than 60% of Enron's 401(k) assets were invested in Enron stock as is common for many large companies. Enron, like many companies, gave employees matching contributions in the form of stock. However, Enron employees were required to hold on to the stock until age 50. Many Enron executives had a different arrangement, allowing them to sell their stock sooner. 
However, lawmakers are divided on whether to cap the amount of employer stock that can be placed in retirement plans. 
A bill by Sens. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., and Jon Corzine, D-N.J., for example, would place a 20% cap on the amount of employer stock that can be placed in employee retirement plans. 
Rep. George Miller, of California, the top Democrat on the House Education panel, said it was imperative that Congress act to update pension laws in order to restore investor confidence, noting the recent turmoil in the stock market over company accounting practices. 
"We've told millions of Americans that this is the road to security," Miller said of 401(k) plans. "We've just hit a huge bump in the road." 
Miller has introduced legislation similar to the Bush plan but it would only require employees to hold company stock for one year before they could sell it rather than three years as Bush suggested.

UK: No quick sale for Enron's UK power station stake.
By Matthew Jones

02/06/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

LONDON, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Future ownership of Enron's most valuable physical asset in Europe, the UK Teesside power station, remained in the balance on Wednesday as its co-owners struggled to unravel contractual issues surrounding the bankrupt U.S. energy company's 250 million pound ($353.5 million) stake. 
Enron's partners in the 1,875 megawatt power station are in talks with their banks in an effort to clarify the complex supply contract and ownership issues left when Enron, which operated the plant, went bankrupt in late November.
"It could take months before the situation is resolved," said a spokeswoman for GPU Power, one of Enron's partners in Teesside, the first independent power station built in the UK after electricity privatisation in the early 1990s. 
"We are currently in talks with the other partners and with the banks," she said. 
Enron Europe went into administration in November as a financial scandal overwhelmed its Houston-based parent and administrators PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) this week said Enron Europe owed "billions" of dollars in losing positions on power and gas trading contracts. 
Enron's 42.5 percent stake in Teesside is probably the collapsed company's most valuable physical asset in Europe, where the bulk of its business was based on trading in energy and commodities. 
Industry sources believe Enron's equity in Teesside, the largest combined cycle plant of its kind in Europe, is likely to be sold to one of its existing partners in the venture. The complex ownership structure is likely to discourage outside bidders. 
"There is no formal process to seek outside bids," a spokeswoman for Enron said. 
She said Enron's partners in Teesside - Midland Power International (GPU Power), Northern Electric owned by MidAmerican Energy and itself part of Berkshire Hathaway , and Western Power Distribution - have first call on whether to acquire Enron's stake. 
ONE STAKE HOLDER NOT INTERESTED 
So far none have declared an interest in doing so. Western Power Distribution said it does not want to extend its 15.4 percent stake in the venture. 
"We are a distributor, not a generator and we are not interested in expanding our generation at Teesside," a company spokesman said. 
Western Power's stance is unsurprising given the current high cost of UK gas set against electricity prices which are at 10-year lows. 
Before Enron's collapse the group's stake in Teesside was valued at about 250 million pounds thanks in part to Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) - contracts to sell power at a set price - which currently provide a steady revenue stream. 
The PPAs are understood to be favourable to the power station since Innogy paid 391 million pounds to get out of the contract it acquired when it bought the supply side business of MEB. 
The Teesside station is run by Teesside Power Limited, of which Teesside Power Holdings has a 50 percent share. 
Enron itself has 85 percent control of Teesside Power Holdings, with Midlands Power International holding the remaining 15 percent. 
Of the other 50 percent of Teesside Power Limited, Midlands Power has 19.2 percent, Northern Electric 15.4 percent and Western Power Distribution 15.4 percent.

Enron's Creditors' Group Setting Stage for Lawsuit Against Andersen
By Kathy Chu

02/06/2002
Dow Jones Business News

Dow Jones Newswires 
NEW YORK -- Arthur Andersen LLP's mountain of legal troubles could get a little higher.
Andersen, which is already dealing with a slew of shareholder lawsuits over its relationship with Enron Corp. (ENRNQ), may be slapped with more litigation in the coming weeks -- this time, by Enron's creditors' committee, according to people familiar with the matter. 
The committee didn't return repeated phone calls seeking comment. But Martin Bienenstock, an attorney who represents Enron and deals with the committee extensively, said, "It's more likely than not" that a lawsuit will be filed. "It's not a question of whether, it's a question of when." 
Andersen didn't return repeated calls seeking comment. 
The lawsuit, always considered a possibility in the legal proceedings, would come on the heels of the Powers report, the three-month internal Enron investigation led by William C. Powers, dean of the University of Texas law school. The report criticized Andersen for failing to give Enron "objective and critical professional advice." 
As a result, the creditors' committee now has more ammunition to use against Andersen, experts said. 
"[The committee] almost has a duty to pursue this," said Nancy D. Rapoport, dean of the University of Houston Law Center. "There's enough in the Powers report that people are going to wonder why, if it doesn't happen." 
In the meantime, the committee is still gathering information. The group is getting ready to subpoena key financial documents and depose select auditing executives. 
A federal bankruptcy judge Tuesday granted the committee's request for an in-depth examination of Andersen, which, according to a court filing, will be given 20 days notice from the time the subpoena is issued to produce documents and 30 days notice before executives are deposed. 
The information gleaned from Andersen over the next few weeks will likely be used as fodder in any potential lawsuit against the auditors. Such a lawsuit could allege fraud and negligence by Andersen related to the firm's advice about the risk associated with Enron's off-balance-sheet transactions and how that risk should be managed, according to bankruptcy experts. 
In court documents filed with the New York bankruptcy court in late December, the creditors' committee said a "complete examination" of Andersen would shed light on the "accounting irregularities disclosed by Enron and the resulting financial implication that in part precipitated the bankruptcy filing ..." 
The extensive documents requested by the group range from routine auditing paperwork to more detailed e-mails and computer disks. But it is the demand for Andersen's "internal manuals, statements of policies and procedures," and "documents referring to, describing, suggesting or alleging possible violations of professional standards in the services Andersen provided to Enron" that suggest the committee isn't just trying to piece together the details of Enron's collapse. 
Rather, the committee seems to be trying to establish a case against Andersen, and recoup for creditors some of the millions it paid the auditing firm, bankruptcy experts said. 
Enron, for its part, plans to steer clear of the committee's deliberations. "We told the creditors' committee at the outset that we would allow the creditors group to take the legal action -- when or whether it was necessary," said Mr. Bienenstock. "They may still be investigating the facts." 
A lawsuit against Andersen by the committee would come as little surprise to bankruptcy experts. "It's not unheard of by any stretch," said Margaret Howard, the scholar-in-residence at the American Bankruptcy Institute, a nonprofit think tank in Alexandria, Va. 
But it could be an uphill, and costly, legal battle. In cases where a creditors' committee or trustee have sued a company's auditors or lawyers, the plaintiffs are usually left with substantial legal fees and a disappointing ruling. That is partly because it's difficult to establish a third party's responsibility for a company's actions, say experts. 
But because Enron's bankruptcy is the largest and possibly the most complex in corporate history, little precedent exists for this type of lawsuit. "It's really going to come down to the quality of the facts and the quality of the lawyers," said Ms. Rapoport. "[The committee] doesn't have to have a slam-dunk case. They only have to be 51% right."

US lawmakers, SEC's Pitt to unveil binding new rules for Wall St analysts

02/06/2002
AFX News
(c) 2002 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

WASHINGTON (AFX) - House lawmakers together with Securities & Exchange Commission chairman Harvey Pitt and executives of the National Association of Securities Dealers plan to unveil a range of new rules tomorrow governing Wall Street financial analysts' conduct. 
The binding new rules, details of which have yet to be fully released, will make Wall Street analysts subject to strong oversight and enforcement in order to boost their independence and stock recommendations, according to a statement from the House Capital Markets subcommittee.
"These people are professionals and should be held to professional standards, especially because what they do has direct bearing on the lives and livelihoods of so many average Americans," said subcommittee chairman Richard Baker. 
Baker said the rules will "protect unsuspecting minnows from irresponsible and self-serving sharks... rebuild Chinese Walls, and usher in dramatic changes in financial sector governance, oversight, disclosure, and responsibility." 
The subcommittee chairman convened a blue ribbon panel of academic experts last year to come up with a range of new rules to reform analysts' independence following a series of hearings which uncovered instances of analysts issuing 'buy' recommendations on stocks while ordering their in-house brokers to sell the same stock. 
Baker's subcommittee also found instances of analysts unwilling to downgrade companies whose stock they themselves owned or whose investment banking business their own firms already handled or were actually seeking with the promise of rosy analyst reports. 
Several Wall Street securities organisations moved to bolster their analysts reporting procedures as a result of the hearings, and several institutions including Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Merrill Lynch & Co Inc subsequently ordered their analysts to disclose all their stock holdings. 
The new rules were due to be unveiled last year, but an announcement has been delayed because of the subcommittee's investigation into Enron Corp's collapse which Baker says makes the reforms even more necessary. 
Baker and Pitt will also be joined by NASD president and chief executive Robert Glauber at tomorrow's press event unveiling the new rules.

Enron's Baxter Died From Self-Inflicted Wound, Examiner Says
2002-02-06 14:52 (New York)

     Houston, Feb. 6 (Bloomberg) -- Former Enron Corp. executive J. Clifford Baxter died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, according to autopsy results from the Harris County, Texas, Medical Examiner's office.
      The report, released today by Chief Medical Examiner Joyce Carter, confirms an earlier ruling that Baxter committed suicide on Jan. 25. Police in the Houston suburb of Sugar Land, Texas, found Baxter's body at 2:23 a.m. in his 2002 Mercedes-Benz, about a mile from his home. Attempts to revive Baxter, who was wearing a blue t-shirt and workout pants, were unsuccessful, the report says.
     A suicide note found at the scene has been sent to the Texas Attorney General's office for a ruling on whether it can be made public. The note said Baxter, 43, was distraught over Enron's collapse and the prospect of testifying against friends who worked there, CNBC reported the day of his death. Baxter resigned in May after a decade with Enron.
     The company is the subject of numerous shareholder lawsuits, as well as congressional and criminal investigations, after filing the largest bankruptcy in corporate history in December. Baxter was Enron's vice chairman before leaving the company in May.
     Sugar Land police are continuing to investigate Baxter's death. Justice of the Peace Jim Richard, who ordered the autopsy and hasn't seen the report, said he expects to concur with Carter's findings.
     "Out of an abundance of caution, I ordered an autopsy,'' he said.

Tragedy
Ripple Effect ; In the wake of the Enron collapse ex-exec Cliff Baxter takes his life

In the past month or two friends had noticed his hair go from salt- and-pepper to almost completely white. Otherwise Cliff Baxter, a former vice chairman of the Enron Corp., seemed in reasonably good spirits. But the collapse of Enron amid allegations of wrongdoing was surely preying on Baxter, 43, who left the company abruptly last May. "People are being investigated; people are being sued," Baxter's wife, Carol Whalen, 43, told a reporter for the Los Angeles Times recently. "This is going to follow people for the rest of their lives, people who didn't do anything wrong." 
A few days later the Enron scandal caught up with her husband-- and the consequences were tragic. In the early morning hours of Jan. 25, Baxter left his $700,000 home in the affluent Houston suburb of Sugar Land, got into his new Mercedes-Benz sedan and drove about a half mile. He pulled over between the medians and shot himself once in the head with a .38-cal. revolver. In the car was a suicide note, which reportedly expressed anguish over Enron's stunning tumble into bankruptcy. In recent weeks Baxter had been subpoenaed by Congress to testify about what he knew of the shady financial dealings that led to the company's fall and had also been named in a class-action suit filed by disgruntled shareholders who claim the top brass cashed in shares before the stock tanked.
The sad irony was that Baxter was one of the few executives who had raised objections within the company about accounting practices that allegedly wildly inflated the firm's profits, and he may have dreaded being forced to go public with his concerns. "Cliff was looking pretty good in this," says one friend who had worked closely with Baxter and is now a consultant. "But he was intensely loyal and would never like to be seen as a guy who's going to tell on everybody else." 
Until the recent troubles, Baxter had led something of a charmed life. The youngest of six children, he was raised in the seaside community of Amityville, N.Y., where his father, Edwin, was a police sergeant and his mother, Dorothy, a municipal employee. He grew up as an avid surfer and boater. After graduating in 1980 from New York University, he enlisted in the Air Force for five years, where he served as a captain. He then attended Columbia University School of Business, graduating first in his class. In 1991 he moved to Houston to join Enron, a formerly staid natural-gas-and-pipeline firm that was then getting into the more aggressive area of trading commodities. 
His intelligence and brashness served Baxter well in Enron's go- go culture. He soon became chairman and CEO of Enron North America, the company's hugely profitable trading business. He was named chief strategy officer in June 2000 and vice chairman of the entire company four months after that. At its peak Enron was ranked as the seventh largest corporation in America. 
Baxter himself enjoyed an uncommonly favorable reputation among those who worked for him. John Allario, who was a manager at Enron North America, recalls the way Baxter handled the teams he coached in the company's annual basketball tournament. "He reminded me of a very successful coach of a college or pro team--very demanding but very fair," says Allario. "He made sure everybody got to play, but he had a burning desire to win." And though Baxter worked long hours, he still carved out plenty of time for his family--wife Carol and their two children, John Clifford III (known as J.C.), 16, and Lauren, 11. "He was very into his family," says one former employee. "He really did go to Disney World every year." Baxter's greatest delight, however, was going out on his 72-ft. cabin cruiser Tranquility. 
Meanwhile, over the past year or so, Baxter had started to raise storm flags over the way Enron did business. In her now-famous memo last August to Enron's former chairman Kenneth Lay, company executive Sherron Watkins pointed out that Baxter had already "complained mightily" to then-chief executive Jeffrey Skilling "and all who would listen, about the inappropriateness of our transactions." (In an interview with NBC's Today Show, Lay's wife, Linda, praised Baxter as a "wonderful man" whose death "makes my heart ache. It makes Ken's heart ache.") When he suddenly stepped down from his post last May, Baxter cited a desire to spend more time with his family as the reason. It is still not clear why he did quit. What is certain is that he left a very wealthy man. From 1998 until early last year, Baxter had sold stock options worth $35.2 million. 
To be safe, police in Sugar Land are continuing to look into Baxter's death, though they say they have no reason to doubt it was a suicide. Congressional investigators in Washington, D.C., were hoping that Baxter would be able to supply some inside information of any possible malfeasance at Enron. Around the depleted corporate headquarters of Enron, which has taken plenty of hits lately, the news of Baxter's suicide left many people "devastated," according to one staffer who worked with Watkins. "It was like the last straw," she says. "It just brings home the total misery of this situation."

Ignorant & Poor? ; His family says Ken Lay was misled about Enron and now is broke. Why Congress isn't likely to buy it

When Ken Lay shows up this week to testify before Congress, the disgraced former chairman of Enron should know how to handle a hostile crowd. Even his current employees, after all, are calling for his head. Just a few weeks ago, Enron employees tell TIME, the Houston-based energy-trading company brought in an outside consulting firm to conduct a series of focus groups with some of the remaining workers on how to reinvigorate the sagging firm. One of the first steps, six out of eight people indicated in one session, should be to get rid of Lay. 
Before the company officially went bankrupt, Lay, who had earned admiration for his unpolished, affable manner, had lost his loyal fan base. In late October--a day after Enron acknowledged that the SEC had opened an investigation of its accounting practices--Lay tried his best to raise the spirits of his downtrodden workforce. At a company gathering caught on videotape, the son of a Missouri minister promised that there wouldn't be any layoffs and that Enron would rise again. For once, though, the rank and file weren't drinking Ken's Kool-Aid. As one disgruntled worker put it, in a statement that Lay chose to read aloud: "I would like to know if you are on crack. If so, that would explain a lot."
Not enough, surely, to satisfy members of Congress. An army of legislators, lawyers and federal agents is bearing down on Lay with the threat of both civil and criminal charges. They all want to know why he seemed to be touting Enron stock and simultaneously selling his own shares--while knowing that the firm he had turned from a staid pipeline operator into an innovative energy-trading giant was imploding. Investigators for plaintiff lawyers tell TIME they are looking into allegations that investment bankers helped top executives like Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling (who is also supposed to pay a visit to Capitol Hill this week) put so-called collars on their stock options so they would not lose money, no matter how low the stock sank. 
Lay's dubious defense strategy was foreshadowed by his wife Linda in an ill-conceived appearance last week on NBC's Today show. She claimed that her husband was hoodwinked by nefarious underlings and that the proof of his innocence is that he and his family are now near bankruptcy. "If those people had come back to him and told him there was anything wrong, he would have stopped it and fixed it," Linda Lay declared. "There's nothing left. Everything we had mostly was in Enron stock." 
When he appears before the Senate Commerce Committee, Lay is expected to argue, as his wife did, that he relied on the counsel of legal and financial experts, who told him there was nothing illicit or unethical about hiding billions of dollars of Enron's debts in off- balance sheet partnerships that ended up inflating the company's reported earnings. To prove his point--and show how much he believed in the company until the bitter end--the man who has collected some $200 million in compensation over the past three years will try to explain how he is now flat broke. An internal Enron probe released Saturday night blamed the company's demise on a wide range of executives and auditors but went easy on Lay. 
But the lawmakers and staff members preparing questions for Lay wonder how he is going to explain away all the evidence to the contrary. Lay's claim of ignorance is "as implausible as imagining that Richard Nixon did not know what was being done by his staff at Watergate," says David Beim, a professor of economics and finance at Columbia University Business School. 
Lay knew all along about the possible ethical conflicts posed by the involvement of Enron chief financial officer Andrew Fastow in off- the-books partnerships with shell corporations, according to a confidential study conducted at Lay's request by the Houston law firm Vinson & Elkins. On Nov. 5, 1997, as first reported by the Wall Street Journal, the executive committee of Enron's board voted to provide hundreds of millions of dollars in loan guarantees to a partnership known as Chewco. Then, in June and November of 1999, the board waived the company's ethics code to allow Fastow to serve as general partner of two additional partnerships, both supposedly independent of Enron. 
It's hard to imagine how the mounting evidence of trouble could have escaped Lay's attention by last summer. Vice chairman Clifford Baxter--who committed suicide late last month--resigned in May after voicing concerns about accounting practices to Lay's top deputy, Jeffrey Skilling. The whistle-blowing memo by Enron vice president Sherron Watkins was sent to Lay on Aug. 15. Another warning memo, from employee Margaret Ceconi, made its way to Lay soon after. Nonetheless, Lay in September was telling employees to buy more stock and bet on Enron's future. 
It was an open secret at Enron that the company was all but a "house of cards that will fall," as a Texas energy executive attending an industry conference in Vail, Colo., a year ago groused to a senior Enron v.p. His dinner companion's startling reply: "You're more right than you know." Even people who believe that Lay was not involved in the dubious dealings of Skilling, Fastow and chief accounting officer Richard Causey concede that Lay had laid the foundation by encouraging Enron's ruthless, winner-take-all culture. A band of cocky, inexperienced young M.B.A.s was left alone to do whatever it took to structure a deal, regardless of the consequences. "Pushing the limits was what you were told to do, and you were given the resources to do it," says an Enron manager. 
The Lays' claim that they are nearly as bankrupt as Enron is not winning them much trust or sympathy in Houston--or in Washington. Ken Lay now holds close to 3 million essentially worthless Enron shares, but he got most of his money by selling Enron stock early, reaping more than $100 million over the past three years. During that same period, he received salary and cash bonuses of more than $17 million. Last year alone he unloaded $25.7 million in Enron stock between January and mid-July as the share price fell from $80 to less than $50. And at the end of 2001, according to public records, he owned stock that today is worth more than $11 million in companies for which he was either an officer or director, including Compaq, Eli Lilly and a bevy of start-ups. 
The Lays own at least 20 properties in Colorado and Texas. These include their principal home--a five-bedroom high-rise condo in Houston that's worth at least $8 million--as well as rental properties from Houston to Galveston that are worth an additional $4.5 million. The Lays are selling all their Aspen, Colo., properties, including a 4,537-sq.-ft. log cabin and a four-bedroom riverfront house, together worth about $20 million. 
What's unclear is how much debt the Lays have. Lay and his lawyers declined to discuss that issue or answer other questions put to them by TIME. Last year Lay sold millions of dollars of Enron stock back to the company to repay some loans. It was not illegal, but it's a maneuver that makes it harder to track insider selling; instead of disposing of stock on the open market and having to declare it publicly soon afterward, Lay did not have to report it until 45 days after the end of the fiscal year. 
It was just that penchant for secrecy that got Enron in trouble in the first place. But as FBI agents and 10 congressional committees and subcommittees probe the scandal, it's only a matter of time before someone breaks the code. And when they do, Ken Lay may well have to deal with an even less sympathetic audience.

Business/Family Business
Lay's Sister Had A Sweet Deal Too

Ken Lay isn't the only member of his family to make a name in Houston's business elite. Travel Agency in the Park, co-owned by his younger sister Sharon Lay, 56, took the No. 4 spot in the Houston Business Journal's 2001 ranking of woman-owned businesses. But Ken Lay didn't just set an example for his sister--his company sent lots of deals her way. From 1996 through 2000, Sharon Lay's company (renamed Alliance Worldwide in December) received $6.8 million in commissions from Enron travel, according to SEC documents. Enron commissions reportedly accounted for half the travel company's revenue. 
While Enron's employees were in theory permitted to book their business travel elsewhere, Sharon Lay's was the agency of choice. Callers to Enron's corporate-travel department still reach a telephone extension at Alliance Worldwide. Enron managers strongly discouraged employees from going elsewhere, according to former Enron staff members. Says one: "You only did that once." A memo last June reminded Enron employees to use TAP because of its volume discounts. But in some cases, the agency quoted fares that were no better than published rates, and still charged Enron a $30-per-ticket fee, Enron insiders say. Sharon and Ken Lay declined to comment.
Other Houston travel firms knew they had little hope of an Enron contract. "Let's just say it was hard to get in," says Gary Pearce, general manager of Navigant, one of the city's largest corporate- travel firms. For all of Ken Lay's belief in free-market competition, for family he made exceptions. Enron also acquired a company owned in part by Ken Lay's son Mark, who then received a three-year, $1 million employment contract. As for Ken Lay, he continues to travel on a private Enron jet.

As a member of Enron Corp.'s board of directors, Frank Savage seemed ideal for providing the kind of unvarnished advice and oversight that big companies need from their governing bodies. A director of Alliance Capital Management, a leading investment company, Savage also served on two other major corporate boards. 
That's what Enron told the world. What it didn't say was that Alliance is part of Axa Financial, a New York investment and insurance company, and that Axa was a huge Enron shareholder. So much for Savage's independence--and so, too, for the independence of the rest of Enron's board.
This week, as Congress holds another round of hearings on Enron's spectacular collapse, lawmakers will begin delving into why Enron's board failed to prevent financial calamity. It has been known that some directors have had extracurricular ties with the company. But the relationships are even tighter than has been revealed. As Enron was crumbling, its board effectively became one composed entirely of insiders, such that even the board committees that served crucial watchdog roles lacked anyone without some other relationship to the firm. 
Because outside directors are a public company's last line of defense, experts widely agree that these members should make up the majority of a company's board. But Enron's outside directors have had investment, consulting, and other business ties to the company, some of them not disclosed. They became involved in Enron's jumble of partnerships and subsidiaries. Several were part of "interlocking directorates," in which they served together not only on the Enron board but on others as well. Some have been involved in organizations that have reaped millions in charity from Enron or its former chief, Kenneth Lay. Beyond those connections, directors had a strong incentive to back Lay's go-go strategy because they were required to take much of their compensation in stock. 
A few cases highlight the problem. Director Robert Belfer was the chief executive of Belco Oil & Gas Corp. For years his company has done tens of millions of dollars in business with Enron units, and it even acquired an Enron-affiliated company. Various Enron entities have invested in Belco. Belfer has joined many other directors in serving with other Enron ventures. 
Many of Enron's directors--including Robert Jaedicke and fellow audit committee members John Mendelsohn, Paulo Farraz-Pereira, Wendy Gramm, Ronnie Chan, and John Wakeham--are listed as directors of a murky Enron entity known as ES Power 3, among the thousands of subsidiaries and partnerships now under scrutiny. 
Sweet charity. Three Enron directors--Mendelsohn, Charles LeMaistre, and John H. Duncan--have been key figures in the University of Texas's M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, which has received at least $1.9 million from Enron or the Lay family or foundation. In Enron's early days, a firm in which Duncan was a partner received hundreds of thousands of dollars for investment services. Director Joe Foy has been a director of a Dallas utility company that competed with Enron to obtain power plant facilities. He was also a retired partner of a Houston law firm that has done work for Enron. 
Several directors have had well-paid consulting contracts with the company they oversaw. Perhaps the most lucrative of them went to John Urquhart, who has earned millions for such services, on top of millions more from stock deals with Enron and affiliated companies. An oil and gas services company affiliated with director Herbert S. Winokur Jr. has also reaped millions in sales from Enron. 
W. Neil Eggleston, an attorney for the outside directors, could not be reached, and directors didn't return phone calls or declined comment. But the directors are expected to argue that the Enron executives and outside auditors withheld crucial information from them. Minutes of board meetings may suggest otherwise. But with Enron's vaporization of $67 billion in shareholder wealth, one thing seems sure: The subject of corporate governance, long the province of academics and activists, won't remain in the corner much longer. 
Bush's first Enron shot 
PENSION REFORM 
Employees would have more flexibility in managing their 401(k)'s--and President Bush deflects criticism that he's too tight with Enron. That's the upshot of a plan Bush announced last week that would allow employees to sell stock matched by their employers after just three years. Under the plan, Bush's first response to the Enron debacle, executives could not divest holdings when employees were barred from doing so. Businesses were pleased; Democrats said their plan is better.

Washington vs. Wall Street, again
The Editors

With 11 congressional committees pawing at the ground to investigate Enron and fears spreading that other corporations may have played hide-the-ball with their finances, the public must decide: Should Washington rein in corporate America? Or will government intervention only make matters worse and put the brakes on economic growth? 
Just about everyone agrees that executives at Enron and its auditor Arthur Andersen should be put through the wringer and held accountable if they broke the law. But beyond that, there's a growing divide. On one side are the free marketers who say Enron is just one bad apple that duped its shareholders.
Congress should close a few accounting loopholes and call it a day--the markets will take care of the rest. On the other side are people who believe Enron is a sign that our regulatory system is broken--that big business is stampeding out of control and that we need new laws and agencies with sharp teeth to regulate the "new economy." 
Though the polling data are still raw, it's not encouraging for the free-market crowd. Three out of four Americans say big business has too much influence over Congress. Nearly as many feel the corporate practices that got Enron in trouble are widespread. Just 8 percent of Americans say they have a great deal of confidence in large corporations. 
Given those numbers, some political analysts say the stage is set for a tectonic shift in how the government and the public treat big business. A quick tour of 20th-century history shows Americans don't tolerate unregulated centers of power. Whether it's big business, big government, or big labor, when one force begins to dominate the landscape, the public tries to restore balance. When robber barons and massive financial trusts corrupted politics and manipulated markets in the early 1900s, the Progressive movement was born and Teddy Roosevelt went on a trustbusting spree. 
Curbing power. Labor's power surged in the 1930s and '40s, bringing long-denied basic rights to workers. But when the public decided labor's muscle was excessive--some 4.6 million workers went on strike in 1946--Congress began reining in unions with the Taft-Hartley Act. 
Government grew dramatically from Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal to Lyndon Johnson's Great Society. But a stagnant economy, Vietnam, and Watergate convinced Americans that Washington was bloated and corrupt. By 1981, Ronald Reagan could proclaim, "Government is not the solution to our problem. Government is the problem." A decade and a half later, Bill Clinton would declare, "The era of big government is over." 
The influence of these forces in society waxes and wanes. CNN political analyst Bill Schneider, who cowrote a book about public attitudes toward these institutions, told U.S. News that America could be on the verge of another "progressive era," where perceived excesses of capitalism are curtailed. "What captivates the public's imagination is the heedless behavior of the Enron executives," Schneider said. "That's where you can draw real parallels between an Enron and the famous trusts of the early 19th century." 
In predictable fashion, Congress is now considering a laundry list of reforms, from how we fund our pensions to how we finance our political campaigns. But for free-market advocates, those "cures" are far worse than the disease. Deregulation and corporate freedom, they say, are what fueled the great booms of the 1980s and 1990s. They insist that the market will correct itself with little new regulation, arguing that it's the financial damage to Enron and Andersen, along with the prospect of their executives doing jail time, that will discourage other companies from pulling the same tricks. 
Some critics have gone further, calling for an end to annual audit requirements altogether. Holman Jenkins of the Wall Street Journal points out that annual audits, required by the federal government for public companies, have failed to detect any of the nation's biggest financial scandals. In fact, rather than detect fraud, annual audits actually do damage by giving investors a false sense of security. Better to have the market hold CEOs responsible for convincing shareholders--by whatever means--that their books are clean. If the CEO can't do it, market forces will punish his company. 
So how should Congress respond to Enron? Is dealing with the specifics of the case enough? Or are we on the cusp of something much bigger? Does Congress need to rein in corporate power in America?

Fact and Comment; Steve Forbes on Enron fallout

ENRON 
In the aftermath, auditors of publicly held companies will become accountable only to the shareholders, not to a company's top management. That means the auditors will be hired and fired by the board of directors' audit committee. It will be the audit committee telling management who's going to be looking over the books rather than the other way around. The audit committee will determine fees, and it will approve the actual payment of those fees. Management won't be able to terminate the services of public accounting firms; only the audit committee will have that power. Management will be able to complain about the auditors, but that's all it'll be able to do. If there are major disputes between management and outside examiners, the audit committee will have to know about those conflicts.
Other than taking care of routine regulatory filings with the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) and perhaps preparing company tax returns, outside auditors will be barred from providing services to publicly held companies whose books they are auditing. 
The SEC should be able to do most of the job of overseeing accountants and accounting rules. If legislation is needed to reinforce the notion that accountants are to work for the shareholders and the public, a now-cowed Congress will quickly comply. 
But let's not kid ourselves. Some managements will still be tempted to cook the books, though they'll have less cover and opportunity. Be that as it may, there are still going to be speculative booms. After all, numerous now-busted dot-coms never resorted to Enron-style sleights-of-hand to attract capital. They had no profits and often no sales, but investors still desired those dot-com shares. These speculative bubbles are similar to one definition of love--a willing suspension of disbelief.

Premonitions; Why the Enron story may be a case of history repeating itself.
Lynn J. Cook and Dan Ackman

Copyright 2002 Forbes Inc.

A spooky antecedent to the Enron scandal goes back 15 years. 
Armed guards at Enron's door. Fake trades and illicit gains. Criminal investigations. Pleas of ignorance from the top. Talk about history repeating itself--this was all back in October 1987, at Enron Oil's trading offices in Valhalla, N.Y. For two years a pair of rogue traders, Enron Oil President Louis Borget and his treasurer, Thomas Mastroeni, routinely violated the company's risk parameters and set up sham oil contracts with phony companies they created. They even pushed all deals through a single brokerage firm, and then collected kickbacks of up to five cents per barrel. Their reported take was almost $6 million. When the scam broke, Enron took an $85 million hit, wiping out the year's expected earnings. Chairman Kenneth Lay expressed shock at the shenanigans.
Kelly Dunn, a futures trader who was then a 24-year-old staffer in the Valhalla office, remembers it well. Looking back, it's hard to imagine Enron brass didn't know Borget was playing fast and loose with deals, she says, because she was told that at least one seasoned oil trader called Houston to warn of Enron Oil's true trading positions and losses. For instance, Enron Oil reportedly had open short positions (contracts to sell oil but no corresponding purchase contracts) in excess of 80 million barrels-more than six times the limit spelled out in Enron's risk-reduction policy and the rough equivalent to three months' output of the North Sea oilfields at the time. Dunn says the risk rules were routinely ignored in Valhalla: Every week position reports that detailed trading activities were written out in longhand and faxed to headquarters. "Houston had to know our position was bigger than we were reporting, if we were making that kind of money," Dunn says. "They turned a blind eye to big profits."

A question of values

At the World Economic Forum last week in New York, talk centered not only on rogue nations like Iraq and North Korea. Delegates also worried about rogue companies like Enron and wondered if the U.S. government would be equally tough on them. 
Are there other huge enterprises out there that could collapse overnight? Many think so. Klaus Schwab, founder of the phenomenally successful World Economic Forum, told U.S. News that, based on his soundings of the business elite, there may be as many as 10 major corporations that could fall without warning.
No doubt, many of them could fail because of tough times. That's how capitalism is supposed to work--as economist Joseph Schumpeter said, it periodically unleashes "gales of creative destruction." We shouldn't worry much about those failures. But others could implode like Enron, companies that have lied to investors and then, when the bubble burst, allowed top executives to walk away with millions while leaving employees and investors holding the bag. 
Our problem is that we can't tell one company from the other because our system of safeguards has broken down. We no longer have reliable fraud protectors to spot the liars in advance. Enron, after all, didn't slip under the radar screen because it went off course once or twice. It hid debt in hundreds if not thousands of sketchy partnerships undisclosed to shareholders and dodged taxes by creating nearly 900 overseas subsidiaries--692 in the Cayman Islands alone. And, it turns out, Enron wasn't alone in hiding its losses behind accounting gimmicks. In the gilded '90s, a good many other companies did the same thing, and their books still aren't straight. 
Predators. That's why it is so disappointing that the Bush administration, admirably harsh in defending us against international wrongdoers, has been lackadaisical in guarding us against economic predators at home. Its response to Enron has been modest at best. To be sure, terror is more dangerous to life and limb. But companies like Enron are dangerous, too: They rob our financial system of public trust, which has always been an essential part of its magic. 
Who wants to invest in liars? 
Harvey Pitt, the president's choice to run the Securities and Exchange Commission, argues that the answer is to tighten up self-policing by industry. He has put forward a plan that is drawing nearly universal scorn. Others have put forward better ideas. Stanford's Maureen McNichols thinks companies should be forced to rotate their auditors every five years, thus avoiding cozy relations. Accountant Dave Cotton proposes that accounting firms work for the stock exchanges, not for private companies. 
These ideas, and others on the table, are worthy of exploration by Congress. But self-policing is ultimately not a complete answer. While most business people are honest--the accounting profession is full of top-flight professionals--some will always put private profits first. Like it or not, the government is the best instrument we have for protecting the public interest, and it is to government that we should turn now. Clearly the place to start is in stopping the sewage of campaign money in politics. 
True, there is no evidence that campaign contributions by Enron or Arthur Andersen bought specific favors from the Bush team. But the record is plain that by flooding Washington with cash, Enron was able to create a "regulatory black hole" so that regulators couldn't see what it was doing. It's also no coincidence that the accounting profession blocked a Clinton-era reform that would have prevented Andersen from performing a $25 million audit and simultaneously receiving $27 million in consulting fees from Enron. Most politicians aren't bought, but until we get campaign finance reform, they will remain on long-term lease. 
With Bush reluctant, Congress must now take the lead: Stiffen criminal penalties for company malfeasance. Restore the SEC as a corporate watchdog with teeth. Straighten up public reporting so that companies are transparent. And protect the pension funds of employees from company manipulation. 
Isn't it obvious, for example, that the SEC must be rebuilt? It was once a top-flight agency whose lawyers and accountants were fierce watchdogs against corporate chicanery. Recently, it has been in turmoil, losing a third of its employees in just three years. Its turnover rate among lawyers is twice that of other government agencies, a reflection, in part, of how our civil service has been allowed to deteriorate. 
Coming to the World Economic Forum, one saw, once again, that America is the envy of many other nations for reasons that extend far beyond our military might. By the standards of much of the world, we are an open and resilient people, remarkably free of corruption. To others, our values help explain why just 5 percent of the world's population produces some 28 percent of the world's wealth. Enron deeply offends our values, and we must act now to stop any encores.

Nation & World; On Politics
The Wives First Club

c Copyright 2002 U.S. News & World Report. All rights reserved.

We've seen this movie before: Politician/CEO gets into big trouble. His lawyers won't let him talk. His political/business advisers worry about his image. His press grows more and more abysmal. He's sinking fast. There is only one thing left to do: Send out the wife. After all, if she still stands by her man, how bad can he be? 
And so it was hardly a surprise when Linda Lay went public last week, defending her hubby, "Kenny Boy" (as both she and President Bush call him), the ex-CEO of Enron fame and misfortune. The sad and tearful spouse testified to her husband's decency and honor, both having been trampled by the "mass hysteria" of the press. "He spent his entire life making absolutely certain that there was never, ever a point in his life that anyone could say he didn't have integrity," she assured NBC's Lisa Myers. ". . . Never, never not for one second would he have allowed anything to go on that was illegal."
Thank goodness we got that all cleared up. 
What a handy idea, this Wives First Club: Send the sympathetic little woman out there as the first character witness to plead her spouse's case. So it was with Hillary Rodham Clinton, who made it clear that Gennifer Flowers was of no concern to her and therefore should be of no concern to us. It worked. And it worked again when Clinton blamed the "vast right-wing conspiracy" for her husband's problems. If she had not defended Bill Clinton, no one else would have. 
Just think of how much ground wives have gained over the years: Did Richard Nixon send Pat out to defend his character? Never. She emerged only to sit behind him during his "Checkers" speech as he struggled to save his vice presidency and once again to wave goodbye to the White House. And as White House counselor John Dean became engulfed in Watergate, where was his wife, Maureen? Sitting silently, too, watching him testify. And where was Lee Hart after her presidential candidate husband, Gary, was caught gallivanting with an attractive blond? Noticeably absent from his first--and most crucial--post-scandal press conference. 
Women's work. So we've come a long way, baby. Maybe it's cultural--feminism writ large. It's no longer unmanly to hide behind a woman's skirts; we've become a great PR move. (Tough luck for those unmarried pedophile priests.) After all, women are more sympathetic characters; at least that's what the pollsters say. We're also more believable. And since we're also legally protected from testifying against our spouses, we're perfect! So long as the culture of personal confession is with us, why not have a woman do the family confessing? In fact, if we don't publicly defend our spouses now, people wonder what's really wrong. To wit: Where was Mrs. Gary Condit last summer when Larry King was on the line? 
One caveat: The spousal defense is not foolproof. It's a good idea to make sure the wife has talking points that are (a) easy to believe and (b) easy to explain. That's where Linda Lay fell way short: In her TV chat, she said the family had "nothing left. Everything we had mostly was in Enron stock." Just what does "mostly" mean in this context? Could it mean the $8 million in stock in two outside companies and an additional $25 million in real-estate holdings? "We're fighting for liquidity," she confessed. If you were a broke ex-Enron employee, would you be sobbing into a Kleenex upon hearing that news? And what about the explanation that CEO extraordinaire Ken Lay was out of his own loop? "There's some things that weren't--that he wasn't told," his wife says. "There's some things that the board of directors . . . didn't know." A vast bureaucratic conspiracy, perhaps? 
Sure, Linda Lay just wants the rest of us to know her husband as she knows her husband. So do his kids, who were also understandably eager to talk about their dad's integrity. (The Lay family even made Ken's ex-wife available, who we learn still likes Ken so much that she even vacations with him and Linda and the rest of the clan.) Remember--even Condit's children went on TV to talk about their great dad. They felt that it was the least they could do. 
The family instinct to protect clan members is as old as civilization itself. But even Socrates, facing death over youth corruption charges, told his jury that he would make his own case. "I have a family, yes . . . and yet I will not bring any of them hither in order to petition you for an acquittal." And why not? "One who has reached my years, and who has a name for wisdom, ought not to demean himself." 
Besides, his wife wasn't good on TV, anyway.

Picture: No caption; Picture: Linda Lay stands by her man, Ken. In trouble? Send out the sympathetic wife.

FAIR COMPETITION Whatever Enron has done to investors, not to mention its employees' retirement plans, the ethically challenged energy-trading giant has been a boon to writers: Three have deals to probe the biggest corporate bankruptcy of all time. Joan O'Neil, a John Wiley & Sons publisher, signed last fall with journalist Loren Fox for Power Shock: The Rise and Fall of Enron. More recently Doubleday won the auction for Power Failure, paying, according to sources, $500,000 to Texas Monthly scribe Mimi Swartz, who had been interviewing Enron whistle-blower Sherron Watkins before her letter to the CEO became public. "We can't give a definitive yes or no at the moment," says Doubleday spokesperson Suzanne Herz, when asked if Watkins will continue to cooperate with Swartz. And PublicAffairs will publish Pipe Dreams, by journalist Robert Bryce. "He...has been following [the story] since well before anyone knew there was a story," insists PublicAffairs editor Lisa Kaufman. Ladies and gents, start your engines.

HEADLINE: Testimony Indicates California Electricity Market Was Troubled in 
1998

BYLINE: By Brandon Bailey

BODY:


??SACRAMENTO, Calif.--California's electricity market was showing signs of
trouble as far back as 1998, the year that it was officially opened to
competition, members of a special legislative investigating committee were 
told
Wednesday.

??Abnormal price spikes -- far higher than what should have occurred in a
competitive market -- were showing up in August 1998, the committee was told 
by
Frank Wolak, a Stanford economist and top advisor to the California 
Independent
System Operator, which runs the state's transmission grid.

??Appearing on the first day of hearings called by a state Senate select
committee to investigate alleged wholesale energy price manipulation, Wolak
testified that the ISO's economic advisors repeatedly found signs that power
suppliers were able to influence prices over the last three years -- even 
before
wholesale prices soared skyhigh last summer.

??By controlling even a relatively small portion of power supply, just enough
to make a difference in whether the state could meet consumers' needs, Wolak
said, generators have been able to charge prices far higher than their costs.

??All told, the ISO has estimated, power suppliers collected more than $ 6
billion in unjustified profits last year.

??In his opinion, Wolak added, that violates the terms by which federal
regulators allowed the suppliers to enter the state's newly deregulated market
when it opened in 1998.

??The ISO is now filing petitions with the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission, asking that agency to revoke the generators' right to charge
unregulated prices.

??But Wolak repeatedly told the committee that he had no evidence that the
suppliers acted in collusion or that they had violated any federal anti-trust
laws.

??When state Senator Joe Dunn, D-Garden Grove, pressed him on the point, Wolak
insisted, "I can't say yes, I can't say no. There's a lot of things that
certainly look puzzling. It's hard without further information and analysis to
say definitively, but there's lots of things to seem to be worth looking 
into."

??Dunn, a former consumer attorney, is leading the Legislature's efforts to
answer a question that a host of other state and federal officials have also
posed: have California's electricity prices been the result of any illegal or
unethical acts?

??Power suppliers and their representatives have repeatedly said the answer is
no. They say their prices are the result of short supplies and natural market
swings.

??"Eleven investigations into California's electricity market have been
conducted or are currently under way," said a statement issued Wednesday by 
Jan
Smutny-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers
Association. "Not one has found or proven any wrongdoing by generators."

??Dunn, however, said Wednesday's testimony was only the start of what he
promised would be a vigorous investigation. He said the committee has already
asked several power companies for records and other information and he hinted
that subpoenas may be issued in the coming weeks.

??"We will try to figure out how to stop these high prices if they are
unjustified," Dunn said at the beginning of the hearing.

??"We're not going to be looking for ways to finance these payments," he 
added.
The state is now paying $ 70 million a day to buy power for California
consumers, after major utilities wracked up billions in debts while buying 
power
on the open market in recent months.

HEADLINE: Developments in California's energy crisis

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

BODY:

??Developments in California's energy crisis:

??THURSDAY:


??- The state remains free of power alerts as reserves stay above 7 percent.

??- Gov. Gray Davis meets with 25 members of the California congressional
delegation at the Los Angeles International Airport to discuss the state's 
power
crisis.

??- An Assembly committee continues hearings on the natural gas supply and
possible price manipulation.

??-The Public Utilities Commission meets in San Francisco to decide whether to
investigate if a key bloc of independent generators are purposely keeping 
their
plants offline.

??WEDNESDAY:


??- Unchecked free-market forces drove up the price of natural gas to Southern
California Edison by about $750 million over the last year, an industry
consultant tells the Assembly Electricity Oversight Subcommittee.

??Meanwhile, the Senate's Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation 
of
the Wholesale Energy Market begins investigating whether electric generators
artificially inflated power prices.

??An industry spokesman predicts the investigations will uncover nothing
illegal.

??- The state offers financial backing to Houston-based Dynegy, which worried
it would not be paid for power generated at its plants in California. Dynegy
agrees to sell 300 megawatts of power from 17 small turbine generators in
Carlsbad after receiving an offer from the California Department of Water
Resources.

??- Gov. Gray Davis urges state regulators to approve the construction of a
controversial 600-megawatt power plant in south San Jose to provide 
electricity
to roughly 450,000 homes in the Silicon Valley.

??- The Democratic governor lobbies Senate Democrats to support his plan to 
pay
$2.7 billion for the transmission lines owned by Southern California Edison.

??State spending on electricity has jumped by more than 50 percent since
Pacific Gas and Electric Corp. declared bankruptcy April 6, thanks in part of
surcharges tacked on by power generators worried they won't be repaid, Davis
said.

??- The Senate Appropriations Committee sends the full Senate a bill creating 
a
public power authority that would loan out up to $5 billion to build or buy
power plants that would be required to sell electricity to consumers at low
rates.

??- An Assembly committee advances a bill ending the exemption under which
utility lobbyists do not have to follow the same reporting requirements as do
other lobbyists. The bill now goes to the Assembly Appropriations Committee.

??- A Pacific Gas and Electric Corp. shareholder sues the company, claiming it
misled shareholders by forecasting annual profits for two quarters last year
when, the suit says, the company knew it was incurring losses.

??-Public Utilities Commission President Loretta Lynch issues a statement late
Wednesday, saying inaction by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission forced
Southern Caifornia Edison Co. to take a large write-off of debt. "The company
should not have to shoulder these liabilities and neither should its 
customers,"
Lynch says.

??- Edison International's stock closes at $11.40, down 48 cents, while stock
in PG&E's parent closes up 14 cents at $9.04.

??- The state remains free of power alerts as reserves stay above 7 percent.



??WHAT'S NEXT:


??- The Assembly's Energy Oversight Subcommittee plans to resume hearings
Thursday in its inquiry into California's highest-in-the-nation natural gas
prices with testimony from gas companies.

??- Davis' representatives continue negotiating with Sempra, the parent 
company
of San Diego Gas and Electric Co., to buy the utility's transmission lines.
Davis says he expects to have an agreement within two weeks.

??- The state Public Utilities Commission will decide Thursday whether to
investigate why a key block of power generators is staying off-line despite
regulators' order last month that they start getting paid by the state's
utilities. Independent Energy Producers Executive Director Jan Smutny-Jones 
says
the generators can't afford to operate because they are still owed more than a
billion dollars, and because the PUC's rates don't cover their operating 
costs.

??PUC President Loretta Lynch also wants the commission to decide Thursday to
investigate whether PG&E's April 6 bankruptcy protection filing is enough of a
threat to the PUC's regulatory authority to prompt more PUC involvement in the
bankruptcy proceedings.



??THE PROBLEM:


??High demand, high wholesale energy costs, transmission glitches and a tight
supply worsened by scarce hydroelectric power in the Northwest and maintenance
at aging California power plants are all factors in California's electricity
crisis.

??Edison and PG&E say they've lost nearly $14 billion since June to high
wholesale prices that the state's electricity deregulation law bars them from
passing on to consumers. PG&E, saying it hasn't received the help it needs 
from
regulators or state lawmakers, filed for federal bankruptcy protection April 
6.

??Electricity and natural gas suppliers, scared off by the two companies' poor
credit ratings, are refusing to sell to them, leading the state in January to
start buying power for the utilities' nearly 9 million residential and 
business
customers. The state is also buying power for a third investor-owned utility,
San Diego Gas & Electric, which is in better financial shape than much larger
Edison and PG&E but also struggling with high wholesale power costs.

??The Public Utilities Commission has raised rates up to 46 percent to help
finance the state's multibillion-dollar power-buying.

HEADLINE: Legislators probe possible power, natural gas collusion

BYLINE: By DON THOMPSON, Associated Press Writer

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO

BODY:

??Southern California Edison was charged about $750 million more this year for
natural gas because of unchecked free-market forces, an industry consultant
testified.

??Paul Carpenter told the Assembly Electricity Oversight Subcommittee on
Wednesday the price spikes came after the El Paso Natural Gas Co. contracted
first with Dynegy and later with its own marketing affiliate, El Paso Merchant
Energy, to control the pipeline capacity.

??Officials with El Paso and other natural gas suppliers are expected to
testify Thursday that they did not illegally manipulate the market.

??The California Public Utilities Commission estimated a year ago that
overcharges by the companies that control natural gas flow drove up prices by 
$
100 million a year to California gas and electricity customers.

??But PUC attorney Harvey Morris said that was before last summer's price
spikes, which he blamed on natural gas suppliers using a "monopoly" to "game 
the
system."

??"It's way worse than we could possibly have imagined," Morris said after
testifying before the subcommittee. "It's obviously way higher than $100
million."

??Natural gas rates at the California border generally tracked national prices
until November, when they spiked as high as 11 times higher than the price of
natural gas elsewhere in the nation, Carpenter said.

??"I have never seen gas prices like this anywhere in the world," said
Carpenter, who has been studying the energy market for 20 years for Cambridge,
Mass.-based consultant The Brattle Group. The Brattle Group was hired by 
Edison
to study the natural gas market.

??The committee is one of two legislative committees exploring whether illegal
market manipulation in the electricity and natural gas markets has driven up
California's energy costs.

??"This is a market that is plagued by the exercise of market power," Frank
Wolak, chairman of the California Independent System Operator's Market
Surveillance Committee, told the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price
Manipulation of the Wholesale Energy Market. The ISO runs the state's power
grid.

??However, "there is no law against me saying, 'I'm not going to sell to 
you,"'
Wolak said. Market manipulation only becomes illegal when there is collusion,
Wolak said, and such evidence is hard to find.

??Electricity generators and natural gas suppliers say a severe supply and
demand imbalance - not market manipulation - has led to higher prices.

??"Everybody's busy doing investigations. They're not interested in solving 
the
problem," said Independent Energy Producers Executive Director Jan 
Smutny-Jones.

??Investigations "are wasting everybody's time," Smutny-Jones said, adding 
that
previous probes and lawsuits have uncovered no wrongdoing. He said the state's
power problems came because state regulators denied utilities the chance to 
sign
long-term energy contracts when they had the chance.

??"People have been playing by the rules," Smutny-Jones said.

??But the Senate committee's first witnesses are ISO officials who authored
studies that claim the state paid more than $6 billion too much for power last
year.

??Committee chair Joseph Dunn, D-Garden Grove, also has slated state Auditor
Elaine Howell, who last month blamed buyers and sellers for skyrocketing
electricity costs. Dunn also has scheduled future testimony from state, 
federal,
academic and private investigators studying the power market.

??He invited five major generators to attend the committee's second hearing
next week. All five - Reliant, Dynegy, Williams Energy, Duke Energy and 
Mirant -
say they are eager to cooperate and clear their names, Dunn said.

??Dunn asked the five for a total of 86 specific documents. If the companies
feel they cannot provide documents because of legal or confidentiality 
concerns,
Dunn said he will subpoena them.

??Smutny-Jones said investigators appear to be growing desperate to blame the
state's natural gas and electricity price hikes on illegal market manipulation
instead of natural market forces.

??He cited Attorney General Bill Lockyer's announcement last week that any
informant who helped prove wrongdoing would be entitled to a percentage of the
state's recovery he estimated could range from $50 million to hundreds of
millions of dollars.

??"If the state's offering a $50 million reward, they haven't found anything,"
Smutny-Jones said. "I don't think you're going to find the fact that anybody 
did
anything criminal here."

??Assemblywoman Jenny Oropeza, D-Long Beach, said she believes otherwise after
Wednesday's testimony: "I think it is very clear there was some price
manipulation going on."

??But Assemblyman John Campbell, R-Irvine, isn't sure there was anything
illegal.

??"There clearly are market forces at work, that's evident," Campbell said.
"Whether you make the jump to market manipulation ... I haven't seen 
conclusive
evidence that leads me to make that jump."

??High demand, high wholesale energy costs, transmission glitches and a tight
supply worsened by scarce hydroelectric power in the Northwest and maintenance
at aging California power plants are all factors in California's electricity
crisis.

??Edison and PG&E say they've lost nearly $14 billion since June to high
wholesale prices that the state's electricity deregulation law bars them from
passing on to consumers. PG&E, saying it hasn't received the help it needs 
from
regulators or state lawmakers, filed for federal bankruptcy protection April 
6.

??Electricity and natural gas suppliers, scared off by the two companies' poor
credit ratings, are refusing to sell to them, leading the state in January to
start buying power for the utilities' nearly 9 million residential and 
business
customers. The state is also buying power for a third investor-owned utility,
San Diego Gas & Electric, which is in better financial shape than much larger
Edison and PG&E but also struggling with high wholesale power costs.

??The Public Utilities Commission has raised rates up to 46 percent to help
finance the state's multibillion-dollar power-buying.

Power bloc blasts seizure idea
Producers say talk of bold action fuels crisis 
By Steve Geissinger
SACRAMENTO BUREAU ?-- Oakland Tribune

SACRAMENTO -- Outraged by a report in The Oakland Tribune that some lawmakers 
asked the governor to seize high-priced power contracts, a key industry group 
Tuesday warned the Davis administration and Legislature that such action 
would worsen the energy crisis. 

"We're publicly saying . . . this kind of rhetoric will have dire 
consequences on both the reliability and cost of power in California for 
years to come," said Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of the Independent 
Energy Producers Association. 

"It is the kind of rhetoric one would expect in Indonesia or the Philippines, 
not the sixth largest economy on the planet," he said in a teleconference. 

At the same time, Davis administration officials confirmed that seizing 
contracts of allegedly profiteering brokers is the most likely last-ditch 
move if options continue to narrow, ahead of the previously discussed 
concepts of seizing California power plants owned by out-of-state firms or 
passing a windfall profits tax. 

Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio pointed out the governor already seized power 
contracts on which California's investor-owned utilities were defaulting in 
early February. 

The state, trying to buy its way out of the energy crisis with no clear end 
in sight, lost a substantial measure of control over electricity prices and 
supplies to the courts with the recent bankruptcy filing by the Pacific Gas 
and Electric Co. 

Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat, employed hard-sell tactics Tuesday in an effort 
to convince reluctant Democrats that their failure to embrace his plan to 
financially rescue teetering Southern California Edison could plunge that 
utility into bankruptcy, as well. 

While most Republicans are flatly opposed to the plan as misguided, 
Democrats, who hold a majority in the Legislature, worry it's a public 
bailout of an investor-owned utility and would hand the state control over 
only Edison's south-state piece of the strategic high-voltage transmission 
grid in California. 

Soaring wholesale power costs have financially shattered utilities, forcing 
the state into runaway, multibillion-dollar spending that helps keep the 
lights on but threatens the state budget. The manager of the state's power 
grid has accused generators and marketers of overcharging Californians more 
than $6 billion in recent months. 

Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys, said Monday that members of 
both legislative houses were interested in seizure of California power 
plants' contracts with brokers, who sell to customers within or outside the 
state. 

Sen. Don Perata, D-Oakland, an outspoken critic of the Davis administration's 
handling of the crisis, said some lawmakers had asked the governor to use 
emergency or eminent domain powers to seize the overpriced contracts and were 
awaiting Davis' answer this week. 

Supporters of the move said seizure would allow the state to control where 
the power is sold and decrease price markups by eliminating the middleman. 

But myriad questions remain unanswered, including regulatory and interstate 
commerce issues as well as any state reimbursement of the brokers. 

Any move to seize power contracts would be overturned by the courts, said 
Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum. 

"Instead of trying to do what's legally within their reach, they go to 
extreme measures that are on their very face unlawful and unconstitutional," 
Ackerman said. 

Moreover, industry officials said, seizure would not only chill industry 
investment in California's power system and lead to higher power costs but 
would be ironic since California has shunned lower-cost, long-term contracts, 
industry officials said. 

"It would create a very unstable political, regulatory environment," 
Smutny-Jones said. "It would have extremely adverse consequences for 
California in the long term." 

Even so, the talk has worried the industry. 

Smutny-Jones said his clients are "very, very troubled by this sudden turn in 
rhetoric." 

"I assume when senior members of the Legislature make pronouncements about 
potentially seizing contracts, it's designed to get our attention and we 
obviously take those things seriously," he said. 

The Independent Energy Producers group is "in the process" of contacting the 
Davis administration and lawmakers, said Smutny-Jones. "You'll hear more 
about this."

HEADLINE: Windfall-profits tax gets Davis' backing

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO

BODY:

??Federal regulators' failure to stop what they described as anti-competitive
practices in the natural-gas industry added $750 million to Southern 
California
Edison's cost of electricity, a consultant estimated yesterday.

??The consultant, Paul Carpenter of the Brattle Group, spoke to an Assembly
subcommittee investigating why California pays the highest natural-gas prices 
in
the nation. Natural gas is a critical part of the electricity crisis because
most of the state's generating plants run on natural gas.

??Natural-gas prices have soared throughout the nation, but the bench mark
price paid at California's border has been double that paid at other bench 
mark
locations throughout the nation for months, according to figures released by 
the
Assembly Subcommittee on Energy Oversight.

??Next week, Carpenter plans to testify at hearings in Washington, D.C., on
behalf of Southern California Edison and the California Public Utilities
Commission, which are asking federal regulators to intervene.

??The giant utility and the state regulatory body contend that a sweetheart
deal between El Paso Natural Gas and El Paso Merchant Energy gave the sister
companies enough market power to artificially raise the price of natural gas
that flows into Southern California from Texas.

??El Paso owns the major pipeline bringing natural gas from fields in New
Mexico and Texas to Southern California. El Paso Merchant Energy is an
unregulated sister company.

??Carpenter called the prices paid in Southern California ''simply
unprecedented'' in the United States. He estimated that the sister companies
manipulated the market enough to add $2.60 to the price of a million British
thermal units of gas.

??In addition, he said, El Paso Merchant Energy owns part of 20 smaller power
plants, ''qualifying facilities'' that get paid based on the price of natural
gas in California. The higher natural-gas prices increase the company's
revenues, Carpenter said.

??El Paso company officials are expected to testify in front of the Assembly
subcommittee today, but in proceedings before the federal regulators they have
denied any sweetheart deal.

??In a report they commissioned, the company blamed the higher natural-gas
prices in Southern California on increased demand and constraints on pipeline
capacity.

??Gov. Gray Davis, meanwhile, gave his strongest endorsement yet to a
windfall-profits tax on generators as a Senate committee chaired by Joseph 
Dunn,
D-Laguna Niguel, began a series of hearings to probe possible price gouging by
generators.

??''I believe the Legislature would be well within its prerogative to insist
that generators receive an appropriate reduction, whether it's 20 percent or 
any
other number the Legislature hit upon,'' Davis said.

??Senate Democrats, Davis said, will form a special committee to help work on
his plan for the state purchase of the transmission system of Southern
California Edison for $2.76 billion, in exchange for state aid in paying off 
the
utilities' debt.

??The governor said he told Senate Democrats, a number of whom are skeptical 
of
the plan, that Edison's parent firm has agreed to back a $3 billion upgrade of
the neighborhood distribution system retained by Edison and to return a $400
million tax refund to the utility.

??At the natural-gas hearing yesterday, state officials said that after El 
Paso
Merchant Energy bought a significant part of the pipeline capacity from its
sister company, it withheld natural gas to drive prices up.

??''Marketers have gamed the system and figured out how to hoard capacity and
undermine competition,'' said Harvey Morris, an attorney for the California
Public Utilities Commission.

??State regulators want the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which
regulates natural gas, to open the market to more competitors.

??But the commission has repeatedly rejected similar complaints in the past. 
On
March 28, FERC ruled that the affiliates did not arrange a sweetheart deal.

??''The fact that El Paso Merchant controls a large volume of capacity does
not, in and of itself, render the El Paso contracts unjust, unreasonable or
unduly discriminatory,'' FERC ruled.

??In other cases involving natural gas, federal regulators acknowledged that
certain contract provisions allowed anti-competitive behavior, but they 
approved
those contracts anyway.

??Lawmakers said they were puzzled by the federal regulators' lack of action.

??''It baffles me that we've found the problem anti-competitive behavior and
market gaming, but there's no cure because federal regulators won't take
action,'' said Assemblyman Juan Vargas, D-San Diego.

Price Caps Don't Fit in Cheney's Head for Figures

BYLINE: GEORGE SKELTON



DATELINE: SACRAMENTO

BODY:


??Want price caps on wholesale electricity to staunch the bleeding of billions
from California? Not going to happen, Vice President Dick Cheney insists. 
Don't
waste your energy thinking about it.

??"Frankly, California is looked on by many folks as a classic example of the
kinds of problems that arise when you do use price caps," Cheney said in a
telephone interview Wednesday.

??The vice president was referring to another type of price cap--the infamous
state cap on consumer rates that has left the private utilities billions short
of enough revenue to pay their gouging wholesalers. What political leaders in
California and the Northwest are pleading for from the Federal Energy 
Regulatory
Commission is a regional cap on wholesale prices.

??Early last year, a megawatt-hour was selling wholesale in California for $
30. By year's end, it had risen to an average $ 300, according to state
officials. At peak, prices have soared to $ 1,500. Meanwhile, demand increased
last year by less than 4%. In fact, demand last month was 9% less than in 
March
2000.

??This is the sorry news for ratepayers/ taxpayers: Californians paid $ 7.4
billion for electricity in 1999. This year, the tab--without price caps--is
projected at $ 70 billion. Gov. Gray Davis disclosed Tuesday that his
administration has been shelling out $ 73 million a day to buy electricity for
the pauper utilities.

??The profits of power producers--many of them Texans and Bush backers--have
risen 400%-500%-600%.


??*

??But none of this budges the Bush administration.

??Price caps, Cheney declares, may provide "short-term political relief for 
the
politicians. But they don't do anything to deal with the basic fundamental
problem." That problem is supply, he says; price caps discourage investment in
new power plants and encourage consumption.

??Counters Garry South, Davis' political strategist: "The notion by free 
market
zanies that you have to let profits rise 500%-600% is ludicrous. Reasonable
profits can be made without bankrupting the system. They're just trying to
protect the profits of their friends in the energy business."

??In truth, California is building power plants as fast as it can. But not
enough new megawatts apparently will be online by summer to prevent
blackouts--and the bleeding of billions more into the pockets of out-of-state
profiteers.

??How about a temporary price cap?

??"Six months? Six years?" Cheney replies. "Once politicians can no longer
resist the temptation to go with price caps, they usually are unable to ever
muster the courage to end them . . .

??"I don't see that as a possibility . . . Any package you can wrap it in, any
fancy rhetoric you can prop it up with, it does not solve the problem."


??*

??The White House clearly understands it has a problem in California--a
political problem. A problem with a Democratic-dominated state that voted
overwhelmingly for Al Gore. And now a problem with that mythical 
headline--Bush
to California: Drop Dead--which seems to be getting bigger each day.

??There have been several recent California: Drop Dead stories. One was in
Sunday's New York Times--"Bush Devoting Scanty Attention to California."
Tuesday, the Sacramento Bee reported that when Cheney met with Northwest 
members
of Congress to discuss West Coast energy, he barred Californians from the 
room.

??Cheney flatly denies it.

??But Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) says she has had trouble making contact
with the Bush White House. She has sent two letters to President Bush asking 
for
a meeting on energy. The first time, she got back a form letter with her name
misspelled. On the second try, she got a group meeting with Cheney.

??"It was very disappointing," she says. "He spoke about letting the free
market work and drilling in Alaska . That's not going to help California in 
the
short-term. We need price caps until we're able to fix this very broken 
market.
. .

??"There seems no interest in really wanting to understand the California
situation."

??I asked Cheney whether he sensed an anti-California bias across the country?
"No more than there's an anti-Texas bias," he replied. "I wouldn't get 
paranoid
about it.

??"The fact is, California is one of the leading states in the nation. Often a
trendsetter. . . . Well, we hope not to emulate your energy policy. Hopefully,
we'll learn from that."

??His message to California: "There's no reason not to be optimistic. The
energy crunch obviously is a significant problem. . . . But it too will pass."

??While learning from California, the Bush White House also might take a
refresher course in the free market Hoover administration.

DAVIS BACKS SILICON VALLEY POWER PROJECT;

ENERGY: GOVERNOR URGES QUICK APPROVAL OF SAN JOSE PLANT DESPITE OPPOSITION BY
CITY AND A POWERFUL FIRM.

BYLINE: JENIFER WARREN and TERENCE MONMANEY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS



DATELINE: SACRAMENTO

BODY:


??Attempting to show that no region in California is safe from sacrifice, Gov.
Gray Davis on Wednesday called for quick state approval of a controversial 
power
plant proposed for the Silicon Valley.

??The governor's action locks him in combat with the San Jose City Council,
which has unanimously rejected the plant, and Cisco Systems, the computer
networking giant that wants to build its worldwide headquarters on adjacent
land.

??In praising the proposed plant as a model of low-polluting efficiency, Davis
said all regions of California must share the pain as the state expands its
power supply--a key step toward ending blackouts and reducing sky-high
electricity prices.

??If approved, the plant would be the 14th licensed by the California Energy
Commission since Davis took office. The 13th--a 510-megawatt plant near San
Diego--was approved unanimously by the commission Wednesday with little
controversy.

??Rushing to expand the state's overtaxed energy supply, the governor has
recently cut in half the approval times for the licensing of some plants. Six
are under construction, according to Davis, and three are scheduled to begin
operation this summer. A fourth--the AES Corp. generator in Huntington Beach
that is due to be restarted --could add more megawatts to the supply this
summer.

??V. John White, an energy consultant in Sacramento, said the governor's newly
active role as an advocate for power plants was a necessary step given the
urgency of the supply shortage.

??"It's very rare, and I wouldn't want him to short-circuit the commission's
review process," White said. "But I think he's trying to reassure folks we're
doing everything we can and not just sitting around in our hot tubs."

??Davis urged the Energy Commission--a five-member panel dominated by his
appointees--to stop talking about the project and grant it a license. If the
commission does so, it will mark only the third time the panel has usurped a
local government's authority over zoning.

??"We are all in this together," Davis said, flanked by a forest of electric
transformers near the Capitol. "We are one state, and we all have to make the
sacrifices necessary to make up for the mistakes of the last 12 years, when no
major power plants were built."

??The governor said the plant's developers, Calpine Corp. and Bechtel
Enterprises Holdings Inc., have made "numerous concessions" to San Jose
officials, including an agreement to sell power exclusively in the region.

??He added that the $ 300-million plant--expected to supply about 450,000
homes--will be equipped with state-of-the-art systems that make it "one of the
cleanest plants to go up in the nation."

??The commission's staff has recommended licensing the project, and some
analysts said the governor's intervention--said to be unprecedented--should 
fuel
momentum for approval.

??Commissioner Robert Laurie--one of two members who held evidentiary hearings
on the project and is preparing a recommendation for the full 
commission--would
not comment on the plant's prospects. But Laurie, an appointee of former Gov.
Pete Wilson, insisted that the project would receive an impartial review.

??"I know the importance of independent decision-making," he said.

??San Jose officials say the Calpine project conflicts with the aesthetics of
its site in a bucolic valley 15 miles south of downtown. On Wednesday, Mayor 
Ron
Gonzales urged the Energy Commission to "give serious attention" to the city's
concerns about the plant's potential impact on residents and the environment.

??"As the project has been designed and proposed to operate . . . it would
present an unfair burden to our community," the mayor said.

??A spokeswoman for the Calpine/Bechtel partnership disagreed and 
characterized
the plant as key to restoring energy stability in the Silicon Valley, a region
heavily dependent on imported power.

??"This is the only project in the pipeline that can help Silicon Valley out 
of
its predicament in the near future," said the spokeswoman, Lisa Poelle.

??She expressed hope that the governor's comments, which cap numerous meetings
between the partnership staff and Davis aides, would encourage San Jose to
soften its stance on the project.

??The 600-megawatt plant is proposed for a swath of open space currently 
leased
to a rancher and occupied by grazing cattle. A preliminary ruling by Laurie 
and
the other commissioner scrutinizing the project is expected by June. The full
commission would take a final vote about a month later, and if a license were
granted, the plant would begin operations sometime in 2003.

??From the beginning, the plant has been dogged by opposition, and the Energy
Commission has held more than 20 hearings--an unusually large number--on its
fate.

??On Wednesday, a spokesman for its heftiest foe, San Jose-based Cisco, said
the company still has serious concerns about "health and safety issues."

??Cisco has strongly opposed the plant because the company wants to build a $
1.3-billion headquarters for 20,000 employees nearby. In the past, Cisco
officials have threatened to relocate to another state if the power plant is
built.

??Company spokesman Steve Langdon said the firm's plans to build an industrial
campus were not scuttled by the announcement Monday that it is cutting 8,500
workers from its payroll because of slumping sales of its Internet networking
equipment.

??But he suggested that the plans were flexible enough to be scaled down for a
smaller work force and that the campus may not house the company's 
headquarters.

??"It doesn't all get built at once," he said. "We will build and occupy the
site over time in phases as needed."

??Another leading opponent of the power plant argued Wednesday that the Energy
Commission lacks authority to override San Jose officials and license the
project. The Santa Teresa Citizen Action Group, launched by homeowners near 
the
site, says the commission may only take such a step if a better plant site
hasn't been identified.

??The group charges that the commission is aware of other available sites,
including one in an industrial part of the East Bay area, and lists eight 
other
reasons the plant should not be built, among them the noise and emissions it
would produce.

??The local Sierra Club chapter, however, has endorsed the plant largely on
grounds that it would run cleaner than existing plants in the area. By
offsetting emissions from those older plants, the new project would actually
reduce air pollution, said Kurt Newick of the Sierra Club's Loma Prieta 
chapter.

??On another front, Davis continued to lobby legislators for support for his
plan to rescue Southern California Edison from bankruptcy through purchase of
the utility's transmission grid.

??Emerging from lunch with state Senate Democrats who are openly wary of the
deal, Davis said he'd made progress to "bridge some of the gaps." It was the
governor's third meeting in two days with lawmakers of both parties.

??Some of the toughest skeptics are members of his own party in the Senate.
Many fear that the deal Davis struck with Edison will hand the utility too 
much
at the expense of ratepayers, and some say bankruptcy might be a better option
for the state's second-largest private utility. Pacific Gas & Electric Co. 
filed
for bankruptcy April 6.

??To assuage concerns, Davis proposed that a special Senate committee be named
to meet with his energy advisors as the administration and Edison finalize
details of the deal before it goes to the Legislature for approval.

??Senate leader John Burton (D-San Francisco), who has called the Edison
agreement "problematic," said he may appoint such a committee but continued to
suggest that an Edison bankruptcy might be acceptable.

??"Many of the Fortune 100 companies have gone into Chapter 11 bankruptcy and
it ain't like the end of the world for anybody," Burton said.

HEADLINE: Ex-energy chief leery of state buying power lines

BYLINE: By Kate Berry

BODY:

??ONTARIO, Calif. _ Former Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said Wednesday 
that
he is "uncomfortable" with the state's $2.76 billion purchase of the
transmission lines of Southern California Edison because it would derail 
future
plans to fully deregulate the state's electricity market.

??"I'm leery of a state purchase," Richardson said at an economic conference 
in
Ontario, adding that "the jury is still out" on a plan by Gov. Gray Davis to
keep Edison out of bankruptcy.

??He called for a rescue of Pacific Gas and Electric, the San Francisco 
utility

??In a half-hour speech, Richardson admonished the Bush administration for
failing to take a more active role in the California crisis. He backs a 
one-year
regional price cap to calm the volatile wholesale market.

??"In the Clinton administration, California was gold," he said. "With the new
administration, it's another ballgame."

??Richardson also pushed for a bipartisan energy bill with Democratic themes
including energy-efficiency standards, conservation and environmental
regulations.

??"We need an energy policy for this country that embraces both parties'
proposals," he said.

??Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham has sparred with Richardson by trying to
rescind new energy-efficiency standards for air conditioners that were

HEADLINE: Alameda public utility rents four backup generators;

Extra electricity will be used during summer rolling blackouts

SOURCE: Chronicle Staff Writer

BYLINE: Matthew Yi

DATELINE: Alameda

BODY:
Alameda's public utility announced yesterday that it is leasing four portable
diesel electrical generators to avoid the one woe of the state's energy crisis
they haven't been able to duck so far -- rolling blackouts.

???The utility's move to provide a backup source of electricity for its
customers is part of a trend among city-owned utilities to gear up for 
expected
power shortages during the dog days of summer.

???Healdsburg, Santa Clara and Palo Alto -- all with their own electric grids
-- are also initiating their own energy backup plans.

???The generators would kick in only during severe energy shortages when
rolling blackouts are on the horizon.

???In Alameda, four generators -- each the size of a tractor trailer -- 
arrived
last week and are ready to be fired up, Alameda Mayor Ralph Appezzato said
yesterday.

???"We're going to be the masters of our destiny," he said.

???Alameda Power and Telecom is one of about 30 municipal utilities in
California that opted not to deregulate with the rest of the state four years
ago. Consequently, its customers' power rates are expected to be stable this
year while Pacific Gas and Electric Co. customers face huge rate increases.

???But municipal utilities such as Alameda's are still part of the statewide
power grid, which is managed by the Independent System Operator, and are 
subject
to rolling blackouts like everybody else when the state's energy reserves dip
below 1.5 percent.

???Each of Alameda's four diesel generators will produce 1.5 megawatts of
power. Each megawatt can light up 1,000 homes, utility officials say.

???The units, leased at a total cost of $68,000 a month through the end of the
year, are parked at Alameda Point.

???Their cost will be paid through the municipal utility's reserve fund and
customers' power bills won't be affected, said Junona Jonas, the utility's
general manager.

???"I think in the long run, we'll see more supply in the state, but until 
that
happens, there will be communities that'll have to take these short-term 
drastic
measures," Jonas said.

???The utility's spokesman, Matthew McCabe, said the diesel exhaust from the
generators won't be an environmental factor.

???"Our environmental record is extremely important to us," McCabe said. "The
diesel generators are only for emergency backup. . . . Besides, these things 
are
clean -- it's not like standing next to a diesel bus."

???The city is also getting help from the U.S. Maritime Administration, which
operates more than a dozen ships at the former Navy station in Alameda. When 
the
juice is low, those ships will unplug from the port and use onboard 
generators,
Jonas said.

???In the North Bay, Healdsburg officials are waiting for the arrival of two
diesel generators. Combined, they are expected to produce 3.5 megawatts of
power, which can account for about 20 percent of the city's expected summer 
peak
load, said Bill Duarte, city utility director.

???"We're taking matters into our own hands," he said.

???Farther south, both Santa Clara and Palo Alto are considering leasing
portable generators, officials said.

???Bill Reichmann, senior electric utility engineer at Santa Clara's Silicon
Valley Power, said the utility is planning to lease eight generators, 
operating
them in the southeastern end of town near the San Jose International Airport.

???Palo Alto's municipal utility also has recommended that the City Council
approve renting two generators starting next month, said spokeswoman Rima
Johnson.E-mail Matthew Yi at myi@sfchronicle.com.

HEADLINE: Davis' gouging claims disputed;

Officials say no link between PG&E bankruptcy, high prices

SOURCE: Chronicle Staff Writer

BYLINE: David Lazarus

BODY:
Officials on the front lines of California's energy mess yesterday challenged
Gov. Gray Davis' assertion that the state is being gouged by power companies
because of PG&E's bankruptcy filing.

???Such dissent from the governor's own subordinates could make it harder for
Davis to gain support for his energy measures in the state Legislature.

???Despite Davis' latest claims, the Department of Water Resources, which is
spending about $70 million a day buying power, said there is no evidence 
linking
recent price increases to Pacific Gas and Electric Co. filing for bankruptcy
protection on April 6.

???"It is a seller's market," said Viju Patel, executive manager of the
Department of Water Resources' power systems department. "The power companies 
do
not need an excuse to raise prices."

???Critics say Davis' penchant for secrecy on energy issues has come back to
haunt him at a time when he needs all the allies he can find.

???"People aren't taking his words at face value," said Michael Shames,
executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego.

???Republican lawmakers -- and even some Democrats -- have challenged a number
of the governor's initiatives, including a multibillion-dollar bailout scheme
for Southern California Edison.

???Nevertheless, Davis reiterated his belief yesterday that recent electricity
price increases are "an aberration driven by the bankruptcy of PG&E."

???He said California's spending on power jumped 40 percent in the week
following PG&E's bankruptcy filing because generators say they face a greater
risk of not being paid.

???"Nothing else in the equation has changed," said Steve Maviglio, a 
spokesman
for the governor. "Everything is the same except the bankruptcy."

???However, power companies were quick to challenge this assertion. They
insisted that PG&E's bankruptcy actually was seen as a positive development by
those in the energy business.

???"If anything, PG&E provides some solace for traders because the bankruptcy
provides an organized mechanism for recovery of payments," said Gary Ackerman,
executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, a Menlo Park
energy-industry association.

???On the other hand, he acknowledged that power companies are becoming
increasingly wary of the state of California's creditworthiness as an energy
buyer.

???The Department of Water Resources already has spent nearly $5 billion 
buying
electricity and has yet to recoup a dime from ratepayers. State regulators are
still trying to come up with a way to apportion the limited revenues from 
power
rates among the various parties in California's energy picture.

???Rating agency Fitch Inc. said yesterday it may cut the state's credit 
rating
because of questions surrounding recovery of energy costs.

???"People are keeping an eye on things," Ackerman said. "They're watching how
California finances things."

???If a premium on electricity sales to the state exists, he said it probably
has been in place since the beginning of the year, well before PG&E's current
woes.

???UCAN's Shames agreed. He said power companies added a "risk premium" to
their California power sales late last year when it looked like the state's
energy troubles were worsening.

???"PG&E's bankruptcy may have increased the uncertainty," Shames said, "but
we've been paying a risk premium for months now."

???Richard Wheatley, a spokesman for Reliant Energy in Houston, insisted that
his company's traders are not using questions about PG&E's or California's
financial solvency as a fresh excuse for higher prices.

???"I haven't seen any evidence of it," he said.

???Mark Palmer, a spokesman for Houston's Enron Corp., laid blame for recent
price increases on low rainfall throughout the West, which has cut output at
hydroelectric facilities, as well as on California's chronic power shortage.

???"It's not that there's a premium on prices," he said. "It's just supply and
demand."

???That said, Palmer acknowledged that California's firm insistance on
blackouts being avoided at all costs leaves the state vulnerable to virtually
any price generators choose to demand.

???"This means prices will be used to allocate a scarce resource," he said.
"There's no other way it could work."

???Bottom line for consumers: It's going to be a long, hot summer, and
electricity prices will soar even higher as demand surges.

???And despite the best efforts of state officials, a daily threat of 
blackouts
remains a virtual certainty as California's beleaguered power grid is 
stretched
to the breaking point.

???At the Department of Water Resources' command center in a Sacramento
shopping mall, the state's team of electricity traders has moved onto a new,
high-tech trading floor, where they negotiate power deals each day from the
crack of dawn.

???The department's Patel said daily blackouts may be averted this summer 
after
consumers see skyrocketing power prices reflected in their bills.

???"People will respond to these prices and they are going to conserve like
never before," Patel predicted.E-mail David Lazarus at

He also acknowledges bailout for Edison will be uphill fight

BYLINE: Lynda Gledhill

DATELINE: Sacramento

BODY:
Gov. Gray Davis urged the state Energy Commission yesterday to approve a
controversial power plant in San Jose, saying California needs every megawatt 
it
can harness.

???Davis' recommendation runs counter to the wishes of the San Jose City
Council and Mayor Ron Gonzales, who have come out against the 600-megawatt
Metcalf Energy Center in south San Jose's Coyote Valley. It also puts the
governor at odds with one of his political allies, Cisco Systems chief John
Chambers, whose company opposes the plant because it would be built near the
tech firm's proposed new campus.

???Davis' announcement came the same day he all but admitted he lacks the
support he needs in the state Senate for the deal he reached with Southern
California Edison to restore the utility to financial health. Davis has
portrayed that deal and construction of new power plants as essential to 
making
California's energy market functional again.

???"I think when we have an opportunity to put more power on line we should
seize it," Davis said. "I believe we spend too much time talking about 
Metcalf.
It's time to start building it."

???The Energy Commission has been reviewing the proposal by Calpine Corp. and
Bechtel Enterprises Inc. for months. The commission's staff recommended in
October that the plant be built, and a final decision is expected by summer. 
If
it is approved, the plant could come on line next year and provide enough
electricity for 600,000 homes.

???None of the five commissioners could be reached yesterday. Three are
Democrats appointed by Davis and two are Republicans appointed by former Gov.
Pete Wilson.

???Gonzales and the rest of the City Council rejected the Metcalf plant in
November. Until yesterday, Davis had sat on the sidelines as the energy crisis
deepened and a long line of state and federal officials, including four of the
five Assembly members from Silicon Valley, urged the commission to overturn 
the
council's vote.

???Some neighborhood groups oppose the plant, along with computer networking
giant Cisco, which hopes to build a 20,000-worker campus on a neighboring
parcel. Cisco chief Chambers donated $50,000 to Davis in the first six months 
of
last year.

???Cisco's reaction yesterday was restrained.

???"We have great respect for the governor and respect his decision," said
Cisco spokesman Steve Langdon.

???However, Langdon added: "We still have serious concerns about health and
safety issues related to the proposed power plant."

???Some neighbors were much angrier.

???"He's trying to act like he's the big, bad tough governor, and he's
spineless," said Issa Ajlouny, who lives in the Santa Teresa neighborhood, 
less
than a mile from the proposed plant. "He knows the approval process isn't
working in his favor, so he's trying to come out and act like a hero to the
state of California. But he's nothing but backstabbing the city of San Jose on
the environmental issues."

???Supporters of the plant see the 14 acres of former junkyard as the perfect
site -- right next to Pacific Gas and Electric Co.'s largest substation in the
South Bay, close to major transmission lines and shielded from its neighbors 
by
a 350-foot hill.

???But a housing development is also nearby, and residents fear the power 
plant
will belch pollutants in an area already suffering from some of the worst air
quality in the Bay Area.

???Mayor Gonzales continued to express his concern yesterday.

???"I would support clean power plants that will help us achieve greater 
energy
self-sufficiency for San Jose residents and business," Gonzales said. "As the
Metcalf project has been designed and proposed to operate, however, it would
present an unfair burden on our community."

???That's not what Davis said, however, calling Metcalf "one of the cleanest,
most efficient plants in the country."

???Davis praised the efforts of Calpine/Bechtel to work with the local
community and said he was especially pleased that the venture had agreed to
commit all the power to the local region.

???"The Silicon Valley is obviously the engine driving our economy, but they
are very dependent on outside power," Davis said.

???Also in Sacramento yesterday, after an hourlong session with Senate
Democrats -- the toughest legislative sell for Davis' proposed Edison deal --
the governor all but admitted his plan could not win enough votes for Senate
approval.

???"I think he knew there weren't enough votes going in," said Sen. Don 
Perata,
D-Oakland. "But there may be a way of perfecting a deal people can at least
think of supporting."

???Senate Democrats have openly opposed Edison's deal, saying the only
beneficiaries are Edison shareholders and power generators who would be paid
every cent owed them by the utility -- at the expense of customers who would 
pay
more to erase Edison's debt.

???Unlike his meeting with Assembly Democrats, after which Davis said he was
encouraged, the governor said yesterday he wanted the Senate to appoint a
special committee to iron out differences over the Edison deal.

???Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco, said he was "not
aware a committee was being set up." He said he favored an up-or-down vote on
Davis' current proposal.Chronicle staff writers Greg Lucas, Alan Gathright and

HEADLINE: B.C. Hydro's credit to California firms exceeded 1999 guidelines

BYLINE: David Baines

SOURCE: Vancouver Sun

BODY:

??A confidential document issued in late 1999 shows that B.C. Hydro's
power-trading subsidiary, Powerex, set a credit limit of $100 million US for 
its
California customers.

??However, by the end of 2000, Powerex had extended three times that amount of
credit to those customers -- the California Independent System Operator and 
the
California Power Exchange. With the California Power Exchange and Cal-ISO's
major customer, Pacific Gas & Electric, under Chapter 11 bankruptcy 
protection,
repayment of this debt is now in doubt.

??Powerex spokesman Wayne Cousins noted that the document obtained by The
Vancouver Sun, which is marked "strictly confidential," was issued in November
1999.

??"That's an old copy of our risk-management policy," he said in an interview
Wednesday.

??"Credit limits have changed since then based on careful assessment of 
several
factors including market conditions, risks, maintaining long-standing
relationships and helping California meet its electricity needs to prevent
crisis situations.

??"Temporary revisions were only implemented after very diligent review
incorporating the best market intelligence available, our own due diligence 
and
on-going dialogue with appropriate market participants."

??He refused to say when the credit limits for Cal-ISO and the California 
Power
Exchange were increased.

??"That type of information is confidential. You have a copy that, I assume,
was leaked in some way, but this is commercially confidential information."

??He said the increase in credit limits helped B.C. Hydro achieve record net
income of about $1 billion during the year ending March 31. This figures does
not include any write-downs that may occur if Powerex determines that any of 
its
customer accounts are not collectible.

??Cousins, however, was insistent that all debts will be collected: "We
continue to pursue monies owing and we expect to be paid for electricity we 
have
sold."

??He noted that Powerex suspended trades to all California entities on Dec. 8
unless those trades were fully secured by creditworthy customers.

??By that time, Cal-ISO and California had racked up an unpaid bill of about $
300 million US, or $475 million Cdn -- about half the net income that Hydro 
has
tentatively reported for the year ending March 31.

??The confidential document states that Powerex's policies and procedures are
designed to control "the risk of financial loss due to changes in market 
prices
or volatility" and "the risk that a counterparty (customer) in a commodity
transaction defaults on delivery and/or settlement."

??It states that the amount of credit to be advanced to any customer depends 
on
its credit rating. An "AAA" customer, for example, may be granted credit to a
maximum of $20 million.

??Cal-ISO and California Power Exchange are not utilities, they are power
pools. They purchase power from Powerex and other suppliers and re-sell it to
utilities such as Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison.

??The pools are not rated, but are assigned specific credit limits. As of
November 1999, Cal-ISO had a credit limit of $40 million US and the 
California 
Power Exchange $60 million US.

??The risk-management document notes that the credit-worthiness of these pools
depends on that of its suppliers.

??"The Powerex credit-risk manager and the treasury manager are responsible 
for
initially evaluating, and then monitoring, the credit-authorization policies 
and
credit limits for each power pool in which Powerex trades," the document 
states.
"Significant alterations in the credit policies of a power pool will trigger a
mandatory reappraisal of the power-pool credit limit."

??California has been caught in a power vice in recent months. The problem
dates back to 1996, when the state developed a plan to deregulate the 
electricity business. Competition was supposed to lower rates below a price 
cap
that had been imposed.

??However, dry conditions cut the ability to generate hydro-electric power and
a surge in the state's economy created unprecedented demand for electricity. 
Prices soared.

??The result was that the California utilities paid record prices for power,
but weren't allowed to pass along the full cost to consumers.

??Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison, the state's two
biggest utilities, now owe about $12 billion.

HEADLINE: Williams again target of overcharging allegations from federal
regulators

DATELINE: TULSA, Okla.

BODY:

??Federal regulators are once against targeting Williams for allegedly
overcharging Californians for electricity. 

??The Tulsa-based energy company was cited in a notice this week from the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for allegedly overcharging California 
customers $25,574 in March.

??Two other companies were also cited in the notice from federal regulators
Monday.

??Dynegy Power Marketing Inc. of Houston was cited for overcharging California
customers $469,662, while Mirant California LLC, of Atlanta, was cited for
overcharges of $92,620.

??The commission told Williams and the other two companies to either refund 
the
money or justify their prices, which exceeded a price of $300 per megawatt 
hour
that was set by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission because of the
California's electricity shortage.

??Williams also was accused of excessive charges of $8 million in January and 
$
21.6 million in February, for a total of $29.6 million.

??Williams spokeswoman Paula Hall-Collins said while the overpricing
allegations against Williams in March were not as significant as in the other
months, the process of justifying them will be the same as in previous months.

??"They determine the price that they feel is fair and justifiable, and then 
we
come back and say why we charged what we did," she said.

??Hall-Collins said federal regulators haven't said whether they are satisfied
with how Williams justified its alleged overcharges from previous months.

??Also in March, the commission accused Williams and AES Southland of
generating less power to drive up electricity prices in May and June 2000,
resulting in alleged overcharging of $10.8 million.

??Williams denies overcharging for electricity it provides.

??In other news, Williams Express Inc., a unit of Williams, announced Tuesday
it was selling 198 MAPCO Express convenience stores to Israel-based Delek 
Group
for $147 million. Most of the stores are in Tennessee and executives expect to
close the deal by the end of May.

??Williams will keep 29 MAPCO stores in Alaska.

HEADLINE: Governor, congressman to fight proposals for national power
deregulation policy

BYLINE: By MARGERY BECK, Associated Press Writer

DATELINE: LINCOLN, Neb.

BODY:

??Gov. Mike Johanns and Rep. Lee Terry, R-Neb., said Wednesday they will be
working to make sure national leaders understand Nebraska's stance on a 
national
energy policy.

??Nebraska's unique status as the only 100 percent public power state in the
nation and its reliance on the corn-based fuel additive ethanol make the 
state's
input in the development of national energy policy important, Johanns said.

??"Public power has worked very well for Nebraska consumers by providing low
cost electricity," he said, adding that the deregulated state of California 
has
suffered through weeks of rolling blackouts. "We are committed to protecting
public power in this environment of deregulation."

??Terry said he has talked at length to the staff of Vice President Dick
Cheney, who has been tapped to come up with a national energy policy draft. 
That
draft will end up before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, on which 
Terry
serves.

??"There will be a discussion about a national deregulation policy," Terry
said.

??A national deregulation policy would threaten Nebraska's public power 
system,
Terry and Johanns said. Terry said he plans to push for a states' rights
exemption to any such policy.

??"It is absolutely necessary that Nebraska have a voice in that discussion,"
Terry said.

??Terry said he also has pleaded with the Bush administration not to grant a
request from California to wave the Clean Air Act's gasoline oxygen 
requirement.

??Such a move is considered a death knell to ethanol, a clean-air fuel
additive, because other states would be expected to follow suit in requesting 
-
and receiving - similar waivers, thereby destroying ethanol's market.

??"They did not telegraph their position on the waiver," Terry said of White
House, which is expected to decide on California's request this spring.

??Other energy concerns Nebraska leaders hope to address are rising heating
costs and gasoline prices, which are expected to top $2 a gallon in Nebraska
this summer.

HEADLINE: California Governor May Back Energy Firm's Proposed Power Plant

BODY:


??Under intense pressure to increase California's energy supply, Gov. Gray
Davis is expected to announce today his support for Calpine Corp.'s proposed
South San Jose power plant -- a move that could ensure the state's most
controversial power project is built.

??Davis said for months that he would not interfere in the environmental 
review
of the proposed 600-megawatt power plant. But a source close to the governor 
said Davis has decided to use Calpine's Coyote Valley project to send a signal
that California is ready to build more power plants and is "open to business."

??San Jose has strenuously opposed the power plant. But Davis' decision to 
urge
the California Energy Commission to approve it would likely hold sway with the
agency, which has authority over where plants are located but has almost never
overridden local opposition.

??The commission -- three of whose five members were appointed by Davis -- is
expected to complete its environmental review and make a decision early this
summer.

??A spokesman for the governor declined to confirm the endorsement. But late
Tuesday, the governor scheduled a press conference for this morning to make an
"important energy generation announcement."

??San Jose Mayor Ron Gonzales declined to comment. But another of the plant's
leading opponents pledged to keep fighting what would be the South Bay's 
largest
power plant.

??An endorsement from Davis would cap a stunning turnaround for the project.

??Five months ago, Calpine's Metcalf Energy Center was unanimously rejected by
the San Jose City Council, which decided that the power plant would be
incompatible with the city's plans to develop high-tech campuses in North 
Coyote
Valley.

??Some Calpine officials even considered giving up plans to build the power
plant.

??But as California's energy woes intensified, the Metcalf plant increasingly
became a poster child for the need for more power generation to reduce the
skyrocketing cost of electricity and avoid rolling blackouts. Silicon Valley,
one of the state's largest electricity consumers, produces only a fraction of
the energy it uses.

??Despite fierce opposition from local residents concerned about the
environmental effects of a large power plant, a steady stream of state and 
local
organizations lined up behind the project, including the Silicon Valley
Manufacturing Group, the San Jose Silicon Valley Chamber of Commerce and the
local chapters of the Sierra Club and American Lung Association.

??The California Assembly voted unanimously in February to urge the energy
commission to override San Jose and license the power plant.

??And top officials and attorneys at the energy commission have been working
for months to ensure that the project wins approval, a Mercury News
investigation of the commission's environmental review of the project showed.
The officials undermined negative environmental assessments of the Metcalf 
site
and silenced commission analysts who said other sites would be better.

??The energy commissioners are weighing the staff's recommendation to approve
the plant.

??Commissioner Robert A. Laurie, who oversaw hearings on the project, insisted
at one hearing two months ago that the commission would complete an 
independent
review.

??Although Davis has stressed his efforts to speed construction of new power
plants, the governor insisted he would not take a position on the project.

??"The governor has repeatedly said he wants the process to play out," Davis
press secretary Steve Maviglio said last week. "The governor believes the 
energy
commission should complete its review."

??But there have been growing signs that Davis would throw his weight behind
Calpine's project.

??A senior energy commission official said aides to the governor have been
calling the commission for months to urge quick approval of the Metcalf plant.
The governor's press secretary said no calls have been made.

??When Davis was looking for a backdrop to hold a press conference earlier 
this
year to announce his plans to speed up approval of new power plants, he chose
Calpine's new plant in Sutter.

??The company also has actively campaigned for the governor's support.

??Earlier this year, Calpine offered to sell the state cheaper power from the
plant if it is approved.

??When Calpine and its development partner Bechtel Enterprises were looking 
for
a lobbyist in Sacramento, the companies turned to Platinum Advisors, whose
president, Darius Anderson, was finance chairman of Davis' 1998 gubernatorial
campaign.

??The San Jose-based company gave the governor $ 19,000 last year, according 
to
state campaign finance reports.

??Maviglio said the governor's ties to Calpine are no different from his
relationship with Cisco Systems CEO John Chambers, who has opposed the power
plant. Campaign finance reports show Chambers gave Davis $ 50,000 last year.

??Calpine officials said Tuesday they did not know of the governor's impending
announcement. But they said they were not surprised. "We've been working with
the governor on a number of issues," said project manager Ken Abreu. "Metcalf 
is
just one of them."

??Meanwhile, Calpine's opponents in San Jose City Hall and in the neighborhood
nearest the proposed power plant appear more isolated than at any time since 
the
contentious debate over the Metcalf site began more than two years ago.

??Mayor Gonzales refused to comment on Davis' planned announcement. "I don't
respond to rumors," said the mayor, who has helped lead opposition to Metcalf.
"I have not heard anything. If he makes a statement, I'll respond."

??But one of Calpine's fiercest local opponents said the nearby Santa Teresa
neighborhood will continue to fight. "We have a strong case," said longtime
South San Jose resident Issa Ajlouny. "And we will win."

??The Mercury News strives to avoid use of unnamed sources. When unnamed
sources are used because information cannot otherwise be obtained, the 
newspaper
generally requires more than one source to confirm the information.

HEADLINE: Davis says Edison agreement may need altering

SOURCE: Scripps-McClatchy Western Service

BYLINE: EMILY BAZAR and KEVIN YAMAMURA

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif.

BODY:

??Gov. Gray Davis indicated Wednesday that he may need to alter the agreement
to purchase Southern California Edison's transmission lines if he wants
legislators to approve the deal.

??Though the Democratic governor declined to discuss particulars, he said he
asked Senate leaders to appoint a special committee dedicated to resolving
disagreements between the administration and lawmakers.

??Many provisions of the memorandum of understanding, the document that lays
out the terms of the Edison deal, must be approved by the Legislature and the
state Public Utilities Commission.

??"There is a determination to try and solve this problem whether or not it
means amending the MOU or trying a slightly different approach," Davis said
after meeting with Senate Democrats.

??A spokesman for the utility declined to comment on the governor's 
statements.

??Davis announced the Edison agreement April 9, just three days after Pacific
Gas & Electric Co. unexpectedly cut off transmission line negotiations with 
the
governor and filed for bankruptcy protection.

??The deal would require the state to pay $2.76 billion for Edison's
transmission lines, or 2.3 times book value. In addition, a portion of 
consumer
electricity rates would be dedicated to paying off the remainder of the
utility's debt, estimated at about $5 billion.

??Both Edison and PG&E stockpiled massive debt when wholesale electricity 
prices soared. Price caps prevented them from passing along the entire cost of
electricity to consumers.

??Since the Edison deal was announced, however, legislators have been critical
of certain provisions, suggesting that California consumers will receive 
little
in return for relieving the utility of billions of dollars in debt.

??"It's clear that the deal, as is, could well be problematic," said Senate
President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco. "This has to do with what's in
the bill, what's in it for the people of the state."

??Lawmakers initially believed they would have little ability to change the
agreement, and referred to it as a "take it or leave it" deal.

??In fact, the memorandum of understanding itself says the deal can be
nullified "in the event any law is passed, adopted or repealed ... (which) 
would
materially impede or frustrate the ability of the Parties to effectuate all of
the elements of the plan as a package."

??But in his meeting with Senate Democrats, Davis indicated he may be willing
to compromise. His goal, he said, is to keep Edison from following PG&E into
bankruptcy.

??"We still have some work to do," Davis said. "I think the appointment of a
special Senate committee, assuming that happens, will let us work through the
detail in an appropriate fashion."

??Burton said he has not decided whether to appoint a committee.

??Other senators came out of the meeting guardedly optimistic that they could
compromise with the governor.

??"It was obvious that there were concerns from members," said Sen. Don 
Perata,
D-Alameda. "He is open and ready to have the proposal perfected as it moves
through the legislative process."

??Sen. Jackie Speier, D-Hillsborough, said she hopes to amend the deal to
ensure power generators are penalized for over-charging the utilities and the
state for electricity.

??"The way it's presently crafted, (generators) are being rewarded," she said.
"They are getting a premium for selling electricity at a higher premium than
ever conceived of by humankind."

Breakthrough made in rescue of PG&E 
State ready to pay $7 billion for lines 
By Steve Geissinger
SACRAMENTO BUREAU 
SACRAMENTO -- Signaling a breakthrough in secret energy crisis talks, the 
Davis administration disclosed Tuesday it may announce the framework of a 
pact to rescue the teetering Pacific Gas and Electric Co. next week. 
"Things are going very well," said Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for Gov. Gray 
Davis. 
The state appears to be poised to pay at least $7 billion -- and possibly 
billions more -- for PG&E's high-voltage transmission lines as part of a deal 
to financially renovate the north-state utility, according to sources 
familiar with the negotiations. 
But consumer advocates insisted that even the $7 billion price is too much to 
pay. And experts warned that a deal with PG&E will be more complex than with 
other utilities. 
PG&E representatives declined comment, in keeping with their policy on the 
talks, even though the Davis administration said an announcement could come 
as early as next week or the following week. The new timetable for an 
announcement was substantially sooner than in Davis' original forecast. 
Until late last week, PG&E was still resisting the sale of its power grid 
despite the fact that Davis had announced the framework of an agreement with 
Southern California Edison. Davis expects to soon announce a similar deal 
with the San Diego Gas and Electric Co. However, any such deal still would 
need federal approval. 
The investor-owned utilities, trapped between high wholesale costs and lower, 
regulated retail rates, amassed nearly $13 billion in debts and were unable 
to buy electricity this winter. With the onset of rolling blackouts, the 
state began brokering billions of dollars in emergency short- and long-term 
power purchases. 
Davis' strategy to ease the energy price and supply crisis includes 
bolstering both conservation and generation while fiscally refurbishing the 
nearly bankrupt utilities. 
As part of the rescue deal, the utilities would have to drop legal actions 
seeking dramatically higher electricity bills, environmentally shield 
wildlands they own, sell power from their generators to Californians for the 
next decade and secure help with their debts from their parent companies. 
Together with the cash infusion from the sale of their power 26,000-mile 
power grids, the utilities would be allowed to sell bonds to raise funds and 
use customer money to pay them off. 
The state would upgrade the high-voltage lines and lease them back to the 
utilities for operation. In a reflection of the negotiations with the three 
utilities, a Davis administration official said the deal with PG&E is proving 
to be more complex than with the other firms. 
Though PG&E finally agreed late last week to sell its transmission grid, the 
utility apparently wants more than the $7 billion that Davis has offered, 
according to sources. 
The figure is more than twice the book amount, or the value placed on the 
system for purposes of accounting. And that's the markup that lured Edison 
into an agreement to sell its smaller portion of the transmission grid for 
$2.8 billion. 
But PG&E, which fears an erosion of its economic base, may be asking as much 
as $10 billion. Due to complexities in the state's 1996 deregulation of the 
industry, PG&E is more likely to lose revenue than Edison as a result of 
selling its transmission lines, according to experts. 
Big customers might be able to bypass the utility's remaining local 
distribution lines, thereby eroding its customer base. 
Therefore the utility may view bankruptcy, and sale of its transmission lines 
to the highest bidder, as a potentially attractive alternative to selling its 
share of the grid to the state at too low a price.

El Paso Energy closes six valley power plants
Filed: 03/07/2001 
By CHIP POWER, Californian staff writer e-mail: ppower@bakersfield.com 
El Paso Energy, citing non-payment from Pacific Gas & Electric Co., said it 
has shut down six cogeneration plants this week. 
The smaller plants produced about 175 megawatts of electricity and are 
located primarily in the San Joaquin Valley, said company spokesman Mel 
Scott. A megawatt can supply power to 1,000 homes. 
At least 10 plants have closed in the past two weeks as a result of 
non-payment, according to the state Independent System Operator, which 
manages most of the state's electrical distribution. 
The El Paso Energy plants are operated with various partners and had not been 
compensated for December, January and February deliveries, said Scott. He 
said he did not know the total amount due but said the plants would be closed 
until PG&E's credit worthiness is improved. 
A cogeneration plant, common in oil fields, simultaneously produces heat 
energy and electrical or mechanical power from the same fuel in the same 
facility. Typically, it produces electricity and steam, which can be deployed 
to enhance oil recovery. 
Kern County is the state's leading oil-producing county. 
El Paso owns or has interests in more than 40,000 miles of interstate and 
intrastate pipeline connecting the nation's principal natural gas supply 
regions to the five largest consuming regions in the United States, namely 
the Gulf Coast, California, the Northeast, the Midwest and the Southeast. 
El Paso closed up 99 cents on Tuesday, or 1.4 percent, at $71.49. The 
Houston-based company's stock price has ranged between $36.31 and $75.30 in 
the last 52 weeks.

Still undecided: Who'll pay DWR for electricity
By Karen Gaudette
ASSOCIATED PRESS 
SAN FRANCISCO -- The price tag is $3.2 billion and counting for electricity 
bought by the state Department of Water Resources for the customers of two 
nearly bankrupt utilities. 
Pacific Gas and Electric Co., Southern California Edison and the state 
disagree over how the DWR eventually will be reimbursed for its purchases on 
the expensive last-minute power market. So do the state power regulators, who 
have the final call over who gets the money when. 
Under a recent law, the DWR went into the electricity-buying business to help 
keep the two utilities from sinking further into their $13 billion debt. The 
state plans to retrieve the money by selling $10 billion in revenue bonds. 
The utilities continue to collect ratepayer dollars on that electricity, 
which the bill's author, Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, says is 
meant to help them begin paying down their debt. 
In a recent letter, however, DWR officials requested that the state Public 
Utilities Commission order that a portion of that money be diverted to the 
state. 
But after the utilities subtract the costs of generating electricity, 
payments to environmentally friendly power plants and other expenses, there 
is no money left from ratepayer dollars to give to the DWR without sinking 
further into debt, PG&E spokesman Ron Low said Tuesday. 
If it passed along money to the DWR, "our undercollection would grow by about 
$2.4 billion by the end of the year," Low said. 
The commission, unable to agree on the best course of action, left the issue 
untouched at its last meeting but expects to revisit the issue when it meets 
this morning. Commissioner Richard Bilas is proposing an alternate plan that 
would have the DWR set its own revenue requirements that would be passed on 
to ratepayers. 
The PUC also is expected to respond to complaints from laid-off workers and 
customers that layoffs by utilities to cut costs have been hurting service. 
Commissioner Carl Wood warned at the last meeting that failure to provide 
safe and reliable service could mean fines for the utilities. 
Representatives from electrical workers unions, the PUC and the utilities 
were to discuss the issue Tuesday afternoon. 
"I don't think we believe that utilities can find a way out of their problems 
by laying off workers," said Mindy Spatt, a spokeswoman with the Utility 
Reform Network. "We think consumers deserve safe and reliable service, and we 
think they deserve it at a reasonable price."

State Taxpayers In Dark on Details Of Energy Deal 
David Lazarus, Chronicle Staff Writer
Wednesday, March 7, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle 
Few people would purchase a car simply because the dealer said, ''Trust me, 
it's a great deal.'' Yet Gov. Gray Davis essentially is telling Californians 
just that about dozens of long-term power contracts. 
Because of confidentiality agreements with power companies, the governor has 
revealed only scant details about the state's multibillion-dollar contracts 
for electricity over the next 10 years. 
"Gov. Davis has our money, and we can't see how he's spending it," said Doug 
Heller, a spokesman for the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in 
Santa Monica. "We've been locked out of the room." 
Neither Davis nor power companies would divulge specific details about the 
price, duration or scope of individual contracts. Each cited secrecy clauses 
that the governor's office said had been desired by both sides. 
What consumers do know is this: 
-- California has signed 40 contracts and tentative accords, valued at about 
$40 billion, to secure enough power to light 9 million homes over the next 
decade. 
-- The average purchase price of each deal is $69 per megawatt hour -- well 
above the $30 to $40 charged by power generators before California's energy 
market went haywire last summer. 
-- If, as is widely expected, wholesale power prices fall in years ahead, the 
state nevertheless will be locked into paying above-market rates for 
electricity. 
But it is not known which generator agreed to part with the most power at the 
cheapest level or the full range of the prices in concocting the $69 average. 
Moreover, it is unclear how shrewdly the state negotiated with taxpayer money 
in securing power on behalf of cash-strapped utilities. 
"These agreements are the bedrock of our long-term energy policy," Davis said 
Monday in announcing the deals. 
The governor's office defended the murky nature of the contracts yesterday. 
"It's a business transaction in which private corporate information is 
included," said Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for Davis. "That's the kind of 
information that never gets revealed." 
While additional elements of the contracts will be publicized in coming 
months, he said, the contracts themselves will remain a secret. 
"You'll never see all the details," Maviglio said. 
This did not sit well with many observers. 
"It's a breach of public trust," said Daniel Bacon, a San Francisco attorney 
specializing in business law. "A public servant spending public money 
shouldn't be able to keep the spending secret." 
But Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, an 
energy-industry association in Menlo Park, called confidentiality agreements 
"a necessary evil in transactions like this." 
He explained that no power company would agree to a long-term contract if 
rival firms could learn the terms of the accord. The company would be losing 
too much of its competitive edge in the marketplace, Ackerman said. 
At the same time, he noted that secrecy allowed the buyer -- in this case, 
California taxpayers -- to secure more favorable terms with individual 
sellers. 
A high price with one generator would not necessarily be sought by all power 
providers. 
Still, the fact that public funds are being used makes confidentiality in 
this case a different matter than, say, Cisco Systems' quietly negotiating to 
take over yet another tech rival. 
"The public is in a very awkward position," said Michael Shames, executive 
director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego. "It has to 
rely on the good word and expertise of the governor, and he has yet to 
demonstrate that he has expertise or good word in this field." 
Shames likened consumers to passengers in a plane being flown by a pilot 
without a license to fly. 
"But what choice do we have?" he asked. "I don't see many other options 
available right now." 
There's the rub. No matter how bad a deal California may have cut to help 
meet its energy demands, the alternative -- blackouts, disruptions, economic 
catastrophe -- is far, far worse. 
On the other hand, it already appears that the new contracts will not shield 
Californians from the threat of daily outages this summer, when demand 
surges. Davis said only about 60 percent of the state's summertime 
electricity needs so far had been met. 
Part of the reason is that many power companies already have contracted for 
their output this year. 
Duke Energy said this was why it would not begin its nine-year contract with 
California until 2002, while Williams Cos. said it would only gradually 
increase the amount of available wattage in its 10-year contract. 
Both companies, meanwhile, will continue to profit this summer by selling 
into the volatile "spot" market, where wholesale power went for as much as 
$1, 500 per megawatt hour last year. 
"You can't sell all your power into long-term contracts," said Paula Hall- 
Collins, a Williams spokeswoman. "You save some for the spot market." 
Consumer groups worry that consumers will be hammered again this summer with 
sky-high power prices, and then get nailed down the road by contracts for 
above-market rates. 
"If we could look at the terms of the deals, we'd see that California is 
being gouged for 10 years," said Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and 
Consumer Rights. "But the governor doesn't want us to see that." 
Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum said the state had gotten the 
best rates it could under current market conditions. 
"California went for long-term contracts when everyone else moved in as 
well," he said. "Californians are paying a price for not acting sooner."

Lawmakers pitch fixes for region's energy woes 
By David Whitney
Bee Washington Bureau
(Published March 7, 2001) 
WASHINGTON -- California members of Congress pleaded for everything from 
wholesale price caps to extending daylight-saving time an extra hour to help 
the region cope this summer with its persistent electricity shortage, but 
none of the ideas seemed to catch fire at a House hearing Tuesday. 
"People will die in California because of this crisis," Rep. Brad Sherman, a 
Los Angeles-area Republican, warned the House Energy and Commerce Committee. 
Sherman testified that his idea for saving lives is to extend daylight-saving 
time by an extra hour, so that there would be more daylight at the end of the 
day when power consumption surges. 
"One of the peak demand periods for electricity occurs between 5 p.m. and 8 
p.m., when the sun sets and people come home from work," Sherman testified. 
"If people come home and it is light out, there is less of an inclination to 
turn a light on." 
Sherman said the state Legislature has called for congressional approval for 
states to be given authority to extend daylight-saving time, and he cited 
analyses by the California Energy Commission and other agencies suggesting 
that it could cut power consumption by 1 percent to 2 percent. 
Sherman, who was one of about a dozen California lawmakers presenting their 
views on the energy squeeze, drew no questions from committee leaders about 
what his legislation might do to everything from airline schedules to 
television programming if West Coast states didn't agree on the same time 
standard. 
Most of the committee's questioning was on the more popular idea proposed by 
several California and Western lawmakers, primarily Democrats, to require the 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to impose caps on wholesale electricity 
prices that have gone wild because of a regional power shortage. 
Rep. Bob Filner, D-San Diego, charged that the price spiral has little to do 
with power shortages but a lot to do with a "small cartel" of generators 
bilking ratepayers. 
Rep. Jay Inslee, D-Wash., said he brought up the idea of regional price caps 
with President Bush, who was initially skeptical. But Inslee said that Bush 
warmed to the idea after being told that protections could be built into the 
caps so as not to discourage construction of new power plants. 
Upon hearing that, Inslee said, Bush invited him to meet with the president's 
Cabinet-level task force led by Vice President Dick Cheney on a national 
energy strategy. But Inslee said he can't get the group to meet with him. 
"It's very disappointing," Inslee said. 
Tuesday's hearing was part of a series the panel is holding on the California 
crisis, so far without any emerging consensus on what, if anything, Congress 
should do.

Power plan called wrong 
Wall Street analysts say the governor's approach to the problem avoids the 
issue that caused the imbalance. 
March 7, 2001 
By DON THOMPSON
The Associated Press 
SACRAMENTO California's scramble to insulate consumers from the soaring price 
of electricity may add to the state's power problems this summer, Wall Street 
analysts said Tuesday. 
Gov. Gray Davis' emphasis on buying utilities' transmission lines and 
negotiating long-term power contracts to help ease their debts skirts the 
deep imbalance between wholesale and market rates that led to the state's 
power problems in the first place, they said. 
"In the long run, it doesn't solve anything," said Michael Worms, an industry 
analyst for Gerard Klauer Mattison & Co. "In the long run, you need to send 
the right price signals to consumers, which will create its own conservation 
signals. Unfortunately, customers were shielded from that in California." 
Davis said Monday that the state's first contracts to buy electricity for two 
financially struggling utilities will provide only about two-thirds of the 
power needed on a typical summer day, forcing Californians to cut power use 
at least 10 percent to avoid blackouts. 
Since early January, the state has been buying one- third of the power 
Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co. customers need. 
The two utilities, denied credit by suppliers, say they have lost nearly $14 
billion due to soaring wholesale electricity prices that the state's 
industry-deregulation law says they cannot pass on to consumers. 
The keepers of the state power grid had enough electricity Tuesday to avoid 
declaring an electricity alert, but have faced an almost-daily scramble for 
weeks due to a tight supply and high wholesale prices. 
Several wholesale and retail rate proposals are circulating. Among them: 
Free-market advocates such as Worms want an immediate end to the 
deregulation-imposed retail rate freeze on Edison and PG&E that will expire 
next year. 
Davis wants a Western price cap of $100 per megawatt hour on power generators 
he says have been prof iteering from California's short energy supply. The 
Bush administration and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission are cool to that 
idea. 
In December, FERC imposed a "soft cap" of $150 per megawatt hour on wholesale 
rates in the state and required suppliers to justify any higher prices they 
charge. 
Consumer groups such as The Utility Reform Network, or TURN, want regulated 
rates for residential and small-business customers, but free-market rates for 
large industrial customers, which sought deregulation in the first place. 
TURN also advocates a tiered rate structure, with higher rates for consumers 
who use more than a reasonable amount of electricity each month. 
Assembly Republicans say electricity and natural-gas prices will fall 
naturally if the state increases supply, mainly by making it easier to build 
plants and pipelines. 
"Right now, you're sort of sitting partially with regulation and part with 
the free market," said Paul Fremont, an analyst with Jefferies & Co. "Both 
these systems work. It's sort of that in-between system that you have in 
Califor nia that doesn't appear to be working." 
The system discourages generators from building new power plants because they 
aren't guaranteed a profit, and it doesn't do enough to discourage power use 
by consumers because the price they pay doesn't reflect the true cost of 
power, Fremont said. 
"I don't think people here have much faith in the market, and why should 
they?" countered TURN's Mindy Spatt. "I think there are probably better ways 
of encouraging consumers to conserve than by gouging them." 
Davis insists the crisis can be resolved without raising rates for Edison and 
PG&E customers beyond "the existing rate structure." 
In January, state regulators imposed temporary rate hikes of 7 to 15 percent 
on Edison and PG&E customers. 
The Legislature and Davis extended the increases for up to a decade to help 
pay back the estimated $10 billion in power buying the state expects to do 
for Edison and PG&E over the next several years, and finance its purchase of 
the power lines owned by the two companies and San Diego Gas & Electric. 
Rates were already scheduled to increase next year for Edison and PG&E 
customers. Under the 1996 deregulation law, the pair's ratepayers saw a 10 
percent rate reduction, but only until early 2002. 
That rate cut will likely expire as planned, Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio 
has said. 
Davis wants those rates to cover not only the traditional cost of generating, 
transporting and distributing power, but the added cost of paying off the two 
utilities' massive debt and buying their transmission lines, said Assemblyman 
Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, the Assembly's chief power negotiator. 
Yet Davis has indirectly addressed the rate imbalance by signing legislation 
that will let regulators raise consumer rates if necessary, Keeley said. 
The governor and lawmakers are in effect spreading out rate increases over a 
decade by using long-term revenue bonds to buy power for the nearly bankrupt 
utilities, said Severin Borenstein, director of the University of California 
Energy Institute. 
"At some point we have to deal with the reality that all of the power that we 
buy has to be paid for by somebody - it's either going to come from taxpayers 
or it's going to come from ratepayers," Bor enstein said. "Raising rates now 
would get us a lot of conservation." 
Davis also wants financial incentives for conservation and power-plant 
construction in time to make a difference this summer. 
"Our mouths were agape" at the rapid timetable, Keeley said. 
Legislators are rushing to pass those incentives by month's end, he said, 
allowing three months for consumers and suppliers to act before the heat of 
summer. 
Among bills considered Tuesday, the Senate Energy Committee approved 
legislation to accelerate the siting of power plants. It also was considering 
a proposal to restructure rates for generators that use renewable energy to 
provide about 30 percent of the state's electricity.

Bill to Cut Some Power Prices Stalls 
Energy: Democrats balk at varying payment levels for alternative generators. 
By DAN MORAIN, JULIE TAMAKI, Times Staff Writers

     SACRAMENTO--Legislation aimed at cutting prices for more than a fourth 
of the power consumed in California stalled Tuesday, as Democrats questioned 
why a few alternative energy generators--some of them campaign donors--stood 
to receive higher payments than others. 
     Lawmakers working to unravel California's energy mess have been 
negotiating for weeks in an effort to cut the price paid to more than 600 
generators of alternative power by more than half, to below 8 cents a 
kilowatt-hour. 
     Those alternative generators' contracts with utilities have shot up in 
recent months because of a rise in the price of natural gas. The 
cash-strapped corporations have suspended or made partial payments to the 
generators over the last few months, causing many to shut down or reduce 
their outputs. 
     But even as the lawmakers reached agreement that pushed the average 
price to near the 8-cent level per kilowatt-hour, some generators would have 
received higher prices under the bill by state Sen. Jim Battin (R-La Quinta). 
     Some of the generators that stood to benefit had donated to Battin's 
campaigns. One--Windtec Inc.--gave Battin a $20,000 campaign donation in 
1999. Others contributed from $3,000 and $5,000 last year. 
     Battin acknowledged that he has received campaign contributions from 
some wind power generators but said there is no connection between the 
donations and the bill's provisions. "It is illegal, it is unethical and it's 
not how I do business," he said. Battin noted that 25% of the state's 
alternative energy producers are in his district. 
     As Democrats on the Senate Energy Committee blocked the bill, Battin 
warned that some alternative energy producers might react to the delay by 
trying to force Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric into 
bankruptcy. 
     "We will be the cause of bankruptcy," Battin said. That prompted Energy 
Committee Chairwoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey) to retort: "I'm really 
tired of being threatened with bankruptcy." 
     Alternative energy producers, including those that use wind, solar 
power, biomass and other means, produce 27% of the energy used in California. 
They sell the electricity to the utilities, which in turn transmit it to 
retail consumers. But with the utilities facing multibillion-dollar debts, 
the alternative energy producers under contract with Edison have not been 
paid since November. 
     Scores of alternative energy producers supported the measure. Edison 
International and the San Francisco-based consumer group, the Utility Reform 
Network, opposed it. Michael Florio of the Utility Reform group said the deal 
could result in higher consumer prices; an Edison representative said the 
same thing. 
     Battin and Assemblyman Fred Keeley (D-Boulder Creek) worked out an 
arrangement with many of the generators. Keeley took the lead in the early 
negotiations, and then turned to Battin to introduce the legislation, SB 47X. 
     Rather convoluted language would have allowed higher payments to a 
select few generators that produce electricity from wind and biomass. 
     Most of California's wind suppliers, for instance, would have received 
about 6 cents per kilowatt-hour. But a handful of them, about half a dozen 
wind farms--mostly in the Palm Springs area represented by Battin--would have 
received 7.8 cents. 
     Battin contends that other wind producers receive additional payments 
that boost them to the same level as Windtec and others that would get the 
higher payments. 
     "They get the same deal," Battin said of the handful of generators that 
would benefit from the provisions he added to the bill. 
     In California's overall energy market, the amount of money that would 
have flowed to the favored generators is minor. But the added prices that 
would have been paid to the generators would have translated to at least $19 
million in the next five years, to be absorbed by Southern California Edison 
customers, according to one analysis. 
     Also Tuesday, more details were disclosed about another leg of the 
state's effort to escape from the energy crunch--the deals with large power 
generators to supply electricity to California for as long as 10 years. 
     Those arrangements were announced by Gov. Gray Davis Monday as "the 
bedrock" of California's energy policy. But some consumer advocates warned 
that the deals could lock the state into excessively high-priced contracts. 
     S. David Freeman, the general manager of the Los Angeles Department of 
Water and Power and Davis' negotiator, said that the state guarded against 
that by varying the time spans of its deals. About 6,000 megawatts are 
expected to be available this summer, about one-third of the energy needed by 
the state, Freeman said. The amount of power under contract swells until more 
than 9,000 megawatts are contracted in 2004, half of the needed amount, 
before dipping to 8,000 megawatts in 2010. 
     "What we're doing here is what everybody said had to be done," Freeman 
said. "We deliberately bought 50% so we'd have a good mix between long-term 
contracts, which may turn out to be somewhat higher or somewhat lower than 
the spot market," and purchases on the spot market.

PG&E could face mutiny on outages: SMUD, others may balk if utility orders 
summer blackouts 
By Carrie Peyton
Bee Staff Writer
(Published March 7, 2001) 
Sacramento's electric utility wants out of a deal that imposes rolling 
blackouts locally on PG&E's command. 
So do a lot of other utilities. 
They've been writing letters, lobbying lawmakers and launching informal talks 
with Pacific Gas and Electric Co. to get off the hook before summer. 
Who dodges the blackout bullet "is going to play out as a political hot 
button" around the state, said George Fraser, head of the Northern California 
Power Agency, a coalition of municipal utilities. 
In Sacramento, the next volley is expected soon, with the Sacramento 
Municipal Utility District reportedly poised to notify PG&E that it will no 
longer black out homes and businesses on the larger utility's command. 
"We are absolutely trying to fight off the requirement for rolling blackouts 
for the Sacramento area," said Linda Davis, one of seven elected members of 
the SMUD board of directors. 
Saying they don't want to be dragged down by somebody else's problems, two 
Southern California utilities have written grid operators asking to be 
exempted from any blackouts caused by PG&E's or Southern California Edison's 
financial woes. 
But in PG&E's view, "California is in an energy crisis (and) ... we're all in 
this together," said spokesman John Nelson. 
The maneuvering comes amid bleak forecasts for power supplies this summer. 
Although Gov. Gray Davis has said conservation, new power plants and moderate 
weather could avert blackouts, officials at the Independent System Operator, 
which runs much of California's grid, expect frequent rotating outages. 
One consulting firm, Cambridge Energy Research Associates, predicts 20 hours 
of rolling blackouts during July and August, and about 200 hours of 
especially intense calls for voluntary cutbacks. 
Before blackouts hit, the jockeying over just whose lights, air conditioners 
and assembly lines will be shut down is growing. The outcome could affect 
millions of people statewide. 
The state Public Utilities Commission is probing rolling blackout programs 
run by the for-profit utilities it regulates, including PG&E and Edison. 
A PUC analysis has suggested that PG&E's program, which currently exempts 
about 40 percent of its customers, should spread the burden more broadly. For 
example, it said, 1.9 million homes and businesses are spared just because 
they share a circuit with a customer deemed "essential." 
But not-for-profit utilities such as SMUD, which answer to their own elected 
boards or city councils, have other worries. 
Many have already lined up their power supplies for summer. Some have raised 
rates or are considering raising rates. Some have taken extra conservation 
steps. They think those preparations ought to give them leverage to ease 
blackout clauses in their contracts with PG&E. 
SMUD general manager Jan Schori "is going to use every avenue ... any avenue, 
to put pressure on," including lobbying the ISO, the governor and others, 
said utility director Davis. 
The Northern California Power Agency, a joint-powers authority that owns and 
operates power plants for municipal utilities, has begun informal 
negotiations with PG&E to change blackout rules, according to Fraser, its top 
executive. 
It is preparing to write PG&E, asking that its members be exempted from 
outages altogether. Failing that, it wants them to face fewer outages or to 
be compensated for cutting off power, he said. 
At SMUD, the utility board has met in closed session to discuss exactly what 
it is required to do during electric emergencies, under terms of the 
interconnection contract that links SMUD's lines to PG&E's. 
"The contracts are being inspected with a fine-tooth comb," said SMUD 
director Howard Posner. 
Schori declined to comment on any specifics. Sources indicated that the main 
option being considered is notifying PG&E that because of changed 
circumstances, SMUD believes it no longer is required to routinely comply 
with outage requests. 
Other options being explored include re-negotiating existing agreements with 
PG&E. 
Posner said that ever since two days of rolling blackouts in January, 
constituents have been asking him, " 'Why are we participating when we're not 
the problem?' And I don't have a good answer to that." 
Several directors said SMUD has already spent a lot of money -- and is 
considering 16 percent rate increases -- to ensure that it has enough 
electricity under contract to meet its customers' summer demands. They 
believe PG&E should do the same. 
"We're almost like a David against Goliath here," said board vice president 
Genevieve Shiroma. "The huge investor-owned utilities next door have severe 
problems that they need to get under control." 
In addition, SMUD plans to argue that because it can cut usage through its 
"Peak Corps" program, which remotely turns off air conditioners at volunteer 
households, it has already done its part without rotating outages, director 
Davis said. 
PG&E believes the interconnection agreements that govern smaller utilities' 
ties to its transmission lines have "benefits and burdens to both sides," 
said Nelson. 
"It wouldn't be fair or good policy for just one provision to be altered 
without taking a look at how that affects the entire contract," he said. 
Interconnection contracts generally have clauses that require utilities to 
help each other out to avert greater emergencies. 
Sometimes reducing demand -- called load shedding -- can be the only way to 
stabilize the electric grid in the seconds after a major power plant or 
transmission line fails. 
"It's been around in the electrical fabric forever," said Jim Pope, head of 
Silicon Valley Power, Santa Clara's city-run utility. In addition to legal 
requirements, "you have a moral obligation so you don't bring the system to 
collapse." 
Like other city-run utilities, Silicon Valley Power has a contract with PG&E 
that requires it to shed load during an electric emergency. But its contract 
allows it to work with big users to reduce their demand, so no one has to be 
completely shut off. 
Such agreements, formed long before deregulation when PG&E ran the north 
state's grid, now are complicated by the 1997 creation of the state 
Independent System Operator. The ISO today runs pieces of the grid owned by 
PG&E, Edison, and San Diego Gas & Electric Co. 
If it believes power use is about to surge past supply, potentially 
triggering a grid collapse across the western United States, the ISO notifies 
the three utilities that they have to shed a certain number of megawatts. 
The big utilities meet that requirement two ways. They cut circuits to some 
of their own customers, and they tell smaller, connected utilities to cut a 
proportionate share. 
In Northern California, about 80 percent of the outages are borne by PG&E 
customers and the rest by customers of SMUD and other municipal utilities and 
irrigation districts. 
"In one sense, we are all in this together. If SMUD were in danger of going 
down, we would hope others would help us out," said SMUD's Posner. "But 
that's if we're in danger from circumstances beyond our control, not from 
mismanagement or lack of financial wherewithal." 
It is unclear what penalties, if any, a utility would face for violating an 
interconnection agreement. In the long run, the issue would be fought either 
in the courts or before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, grid 
officials said. 
As a practical matter, in the seconds when the risk to the grid is greatest, 
if one utility refused to shed load, the ISO would probably solve to problem 
by calling on PG&E, Edison or others who are willing to make deeper cutbacks, 
they said.

PUC to Decide Fate Of Utility Workers 
PG&E, Edison want to trim costs by laying off thousands, cutting service 
Bernadette Tansey, Chronicle Staff Writer
Wednesday, March 7, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle 
State regulators are set to decide today whether debt-ridden Pacific Gas and 
Electric Co. and Southern California Edison can conserve cash by laying off 
thousands of workers and letting service standards slip. 
Union officials who protested the layoffs before the California Public 
Utilities Commission warn that if the cuts go through, neighborhoods hit by 
power outages could stay dark for hours, and more customers could face busy 
signals when they call about their bills. 
An administrative law judge agreed, advising the commission in February to 
order the utilities to restore 725 positions already cut and block the 
elimination of an additional 2,125 jobs. 
Judge John Wong said PG&E and Edison have acknowledged the layoffs will not 
substantially improve their shaky financial condition, which arose from 
skyrocketing wholesale electricity costs the utilities could not pass on to 
consumers under a rate cap. 
"The savings would barely make a dent," Wong said in his draft decision. The 
two companies together claim that their debt from power purchases amounts to 
more than $13 billion. PG&E says it has saved $18 million from the first wave 
of 325 layoffs. 
Wong's recommendation is already running into resistance on the PUC. 
Commissioner Richard Bilas said the five-member panel should not be 
micromanaging the utilities in a time of crisis. 
Bilas has proposed an alternate ruling that would allow the utilities to make 
the cuts, but provide for PUC monitoring of service in case the commission 
wants to step in later. 
"We're in a situation where the utilities are not collecting the revenues 
they need to operate, and yet we may be guilty of not letting them cut 
expenses where they can cut expenses," Bilas said. 
PG&E spokesman Jon Tremayne said savings from the layoffs are helping to keep 
electricity running and gas flowing. 
"It keeps cash in our accounts so we can keep doing day-to-day business," 
Tremayne said. 
In addition to the 325 positions dropped so far, PG&E is proposing to cut an 
additional 675 during the next three to six months. The cuts affect temporary 
and contract workers who read meters, handle new service hookups and replace 
equipment. PG&E has no plans to eliminate permanent positions. 
The company is struggling to keep up with a higher workload at its call 
center as customers deluge the lines with inquiries about their rising bills 
and the effects of deregulation. Calls to PG&E ballooned from 1.3 million in 
January 2000 to 2.3 million in January 2001. 
Bilas advocates granting PG&E's request to temporarily relax standards 
requiring the utility to respond swiftly to customer calls and to read 
customers' meters once a month. PG&E wants to read meters bimonthly and send 
bills based on the estimated use between readings. Discrepancies could be 
corrected later. 
Wong called those measures unacceptable. He said customers need to know 
immediately if their efforts to conserve power are working. Wong also said 
the utilities' own experts have said the workforce reductions will lengthen 
the time required to restore power after nonemergency equipment failure. 
Eric Wolfe, communications director for the International Brotherhood of 
Electrical Workers, Local 1245, said some customers have already been left 
without power overnight because PG&E is trying to avoid the use of overtime 
on nonemergency power outages. 
"It hurts a lineman to walk away from the job leaving a customer without 
power," Wolfe said. 

Tremayne said PG&E is trying to minimize overtime costs, but denied the 
company has allowed customers to go without power out of financial concerns. 
He said crews were pulled out when darkness and falling trees made the work 
too dangerous.

Power prices could soar during the summer 
Posted at 10:35 p.m. PST Tuesday, March 6, 2001 
BY STEVE JOHNSON 

Mercury News 

Unless Gov. Gray Davis arranges significantly more long-term electricity 
contracts or persuades people to turn off a lot more lights, California's 
unpredictable spot market for power could wreak havoc this summer. 
Even with the 40 long-term deals announced by Davis on Monday, experts 
interviewed Tuesday said, up to 43 percent of the state's daily needs may 
have to come from this highly volatile market, in which power is bought 
within a day of need. That could could prove hugely expensive, because some 
spot market energy has cost five to six times what it would under the 
long-term contracts. 
It's widely expected that consumers ultimately would have to pay that tab, 
which could amount to billions of dollars. 
And because that power won't be locked up in contracts, there is no guarantee 
it will be available when it's needed, which could lead to blackouts, 
according to a recent report to the California Independent System Operator, 
which oversees three-fourths of the state's power grid. 
``The situation in California could reach catastrophic proportions,'' the 
report concluded, adding that unless things change dramatically, ``it is a 
virtual certainty that peak demand will go unmet during many hot summer 
days.'' 
Steven Maviglio, Davis' press secretary, conceded Tuesday that the spot 
market could be troublesome. ``It's a major concern,'' he said, which is why 
the state is trying to line up more power contracts, speed up power plant 
construction and promote conservation. 
During the normally hot month of August, peak daily demand for power in the 
Independent System Operator's territory is expected to hit about 47,700 
megawatts -- enough for nearly 48 million homes. 
The state's three main utility firms generate about 8,200 megawatts and have 
long-term contracts from wind, solar and other energy sources for about 
11,700 megawatts more. 
That totals about 20,000 megawatts. Add in the 7,000 megawatts of long-term 
power that Davis has announced for this summer, and the state is still nearly 
21,000 megawatts short. 
Costly proposition 
If all that power has to be obtained on the spot market, the price could be 
high. On Friday, last-minute purchases on the market averaged $411 per 
megawatt-hour, compared to about $150 per megawatt-hour for all power 
obtained by the Independent System Operator and $69 per megawatt-hour on 
average under Davis' long-term contracts. 
It's possible that not all 21,000 megawatts would have to be purchased on the 
market. Assuming Davis is successful in getting people to save 10 percent -- 
which could prove difficult -- conservation could reduce peak demand by 
nearly 5,000 megawatts. 
California also might be able to trade for another 5,000 megawatts with the 
federal government's Bonneville Power Administration and a hydroelectric 
operator in British Columbia, said Arthur O'Donnell, editor of California 
Energy Markets, a trade publication. 
Under such deals, those two outfits often send that much power to California 
when they don't need it and California returns the same amount or more when 
its demand is low. 
But O'Donnell said it wasn't clear whether 5,000 megawatts would be available 
this summer, because ``they still haven't gotten the snowpack they need in 
the Pacific Northwest,'' which could limit that region's generating capacity. 
Still falling short 
Even if those hydropower imports are available and conservation works as 
Davis hopes, it's likely California would still require the spot market for 
11,000 megawatts to meet the August demand. That's more than 20 percent of 
the state's overall power needs. 
``All of the surrounding states are buying probably less than 5 percent, at 
most, of their energy on the spot market,'' said Frank Wolak, a Stanford 
economist, who monitors electricity prices for the Independent System 
Operator. He worries about how much that power could cost and is disturbed 
that state officials haven't adequately addressed the issue. 
``No one has any idea what they are going to do, and that is part of the 
problem,'' he said. 
Officials at Pacific Gas & Electric Co. are particularly concerned. They fear 
that their company -- which is nearing bankruptcy -- could get stuck for much 
of the spot market purchases by the Independent System Operator, which has 
threatened to bill the utilities for the cost. 
Fearing the annual bill for that power could hit $2.4 billion this year, PG&E 
wants the tab sent to the Department of Water Resources, which also is buying 
power on the spot market for the state. But the Department of Water Resources 
has objected to that idea and the matter is expected to be heard today by the 
California Public Utilities Commission. 
``We're looking for clarity on a number of issues'' regarding how the spot 
market will work ``and certainly that's one of them,'' said Thomas Hannigan, 
the water agency's director. 
``I don't think anybody knows the answer of who's going to pay for it,'' 
added PG&E spokesman John Nelson. But Nettie Hoge, executive director of the 
Utility Reform Network in San Francisco, said she suspects consumers 
ultimately will foot the bill. 
The unfortunate likelihood about spot market purchases is that ``ratepayers 
are responsible for all of it eventually,'' Hoge said. ``It's a very big 
problem.''

Power Plant Plans Cause Conflicts 
East county residents blast supervisors 
Jason B. Johnson, Chronicle Staff Writer
Wednesday, March 7, 2001 
Industry dreams of building new power plants in east Contra Costa's hills are 
prompting an angry reaction among residents and elected officials who say 
they don't want more plants. 
The conflict was sparked by a vote by county supervisors yesterday to 
aggressively explore possible sites for new power plants throughout the 
county. 
The measure by Supervisors Mark DeSaulnier and Federal Glover, which passed 
on a 4-to-0 vote, directs the county administrator and Department of 
Community Development to compile a report on possible sites within 45 days. 
Supervisor Donna Gerber abstained after criticizing the plan for potentially 
repeating the same mistakes that plagued the state's energy deregulation 
effort by not considering how much energy the state, region and county will 
need in future years, and how much power is slated to come online. 
Gerber said alternative power sources, such as solar, should also be 
examined. 
A site drawing much attention is on top of a deposit of natural gas near the 
Concord Naval Weapons Station off Highway 4. 
The owners of 70 acres of land near the station recently formed a company, 
Golden State Power Co., to pursue construction of at least one small peaker 
plant and a much larger facility capable of producing 600 megawatts. 
The site could hold up to three small 50-megawatt peaker plants, and a larger 
15-acre natural gas plant, said Steve Thomas, managing partner with Golden 
State. No land use applications have been filed. 
Thomas said 30 acres could be kept as open space to form a buffer around the 
project. 
"Both (facilities) are state of the art," said Thomas. "We believe that the 
site is ideal." 
But east county residents at yesterday's meeting blasted the supervisorial 
measure and the power plant proposal, complaining that more plants could put 
people's health at risk. The region already is home to six power plants. 
"We're going to get a good dose of poor air quality and (negative) health 
conditions from this," said Concord resident Evelyn Frietas. "I think we need 
to stop and think about what we're doing to our quality of life." 
Dan Torres said the home he bought in 1995 at a new Bay Point development 
would be alarmingly close to the proposed Golden State site. 
"It will be dragging emissions over our home," said Torres. "I didn't buy a 
home on that hill to be surrounded by power plants." 
There are six power plants in operation in east Contra Costa. 
Pittsburg already has two power plants, and two more under construction. City 
Council members Frank Aiello and Yvonne Beals said the Antioch-Pittsburg area 
has done more than its share of energy production. 
Aiello said Pittsburg will soon produce enough energy to power three million 
homes in California. 
"When is enough, enough?" asked Aiello. "Pittsburg has shouldered 
responsibility for a land-fill and two more power plants. At some point you 
have to say enough." 
Beals said that while power plants have added millions to the city's general 
fund, the negatives of additional plants could outweigh the benefits. 
"I don't think that Pittsburg or east county should be the dumping ground for 
energy for California," said Beals.

Supervisors set search for power plant sites 
The board also heard from the potential developers of a 650-megawatt plant 
between Bay Point and Concord 
By Thomas Peele
TIMES STAFF WRITER 
MARTINEZ -- Contra Costa County supervisors took tentative steps Tuesday 
toward allowing the construction of at least one small power plant before 
summer, ordering that its staff identify potential sites in unincorporated 
areas within seven weeks. 
The board voted 4-0 to search for locations. Third District Supervisor Donna 
Gerber abstained, saying her colleagues lacked a "comprehensive context'' to 
identify sites. "I think the board knows just enough to be dangerous,'' she 
said. 
Gerber said the county should examine the potential for additional power 
plants within its borders but not investigate individual sites yet. 
But Fourth District Supervisor Mark DeSaulnier said the action was necessary 
because of the energy crisis and because of Gov. Gray Davis' call for local 
governments to help speed the construction of so-called "peaker plants" 
before July and August. 
"I wouldn't do this except under an emergency," DeSaulnier said after the 
vote. "There are unusual circumstances. We're not talking about putting this 
in a residential area." 
Fifth District Supervisor Federal Glover backed DeSaulnier, but said he hoped 
for a location outside his heavily industrialized East County district. 
"There's a lot of concern in East County as to the number of plants," he 
said. 
DeSaulnier said, though, that the only logical place for a small plant 
remains the "industrial belt'' stretching along the waterfront from West 
County to Antioch. He declined to provide specifics, but said the only other 
potential site outside the industrial areas was the Concord Naval Weapons 
Station property. But he quickly added that he believes the U.S. Department 
of Defense "would never go for it." 
Also, DeSaulnier said he could not rule out the county building the plant 
itself and entering the electricity-selling market during peak demand times. 
Board Chairwoman Gayle Uilkema called that idea extremely premature and 
unlikely. "That's a very powerful decision. I do not think we are ready,'' 
she said. 
The California Energy Commission listed the Equilon refinery in Martinez as 
one of 32 potential "peaker plant" sites in the state last week. 
Peaker plants kick in during peak usage times. Davis called for their quick 
construction before the height of summer and its energy demand for air 
conditioning. 
Plants that generate as much as 50,000 megawatts don't need Energy Commission 
approval. DeSaulnier said he believed a peaker plant could be built about a 
month after final approval. 
Supervisors also heard from the potential developers of a 650-megawatt plant 
between Bay Point and Concord. Walnut Creek commercial real estate developer 
Steve Thomas announced his intentions for the site north of Highway 4 last 
week. Construction could take two years. 
Eric Hasseltine, a consultant representing Thomas and what he described as a 
"brand new" company for the site, the Golden State Power Co., told 
supervisors that if they intended to speed peaker plant construction they 
should do what they can to expedite the larger plant. The Thomas site could 
house a peaker plant until the proposed larger one goes online. 
A large natural gas line passes under the site. 
DeSaulnier seemed cautious about the larger proposal, which he had described 
last week as "a good site." Uilkema, too, said she knew too little about it 
to comment. 
A resident who lives near the Thomas property asked the board to "build it 
(the larger plant) closer to where you have industrial areas. You have to 
carefully consider the people" who live nearby, said Dan Torres, 39. 
Evelyn Freitas of Concord said she lives downwind of the proposed site. "Our 
air quality is going to be worse then it is now," she said. 
Gerber played on the environmental issues, saying the county already ranks 
second statewide to Los Angeles in volume of hazardous materials and amount 
of electrical generation.

Peter Schrag: California's $90 billion infrastructure gap


(Published March 7, 2001) 

By now, California's surreal energy mess has grown from a crisis to a 
condition. It may not be quite as permanent as, say, death and taxes, but 
it's still something that could get a whole lot worse before it gets better. 
Until there's more realistic pricing, no gubernatorial pea-under-the-shell 
buyout scheme will solve it. 
Beyond the energy crisis, however, and in many ways similar to it, California 
faces a whole range of other infrastructure problems -- in transportation, in 
water resources and sewer systems, in school and university buildings -- that 
seem, once again, to be all but forgotten. 
The Business Roundtable has estimated the need at roughly $90 billion, though 
no number can possibly be exact. What's certain is that after a burst of 
high-level investment in public facilities during the 1950s and 1960s, 
California's annual capital investment has sunk precipitously -- from an 
annual $150 per capita in the 1960s, according to a set of recent studies for 
PPIC, the Public Policy Institute of California, to about $30 in the 1990s. 
But you probably don't need to tell anyone driving Bay Area or Los Angeles 
freeways or looking at the ubiquitous portable classrooms, those dreary brown 
boxes that house a fourth of our public school students. Ever since passage 
of Proposition 13 in 1978, we have been flying the flag of deferred 
maintenance. 
As in the state's electricity crisis, however, there's no way California can 
effectively address those problems merely by building or bonding itself out 
of them. In highway construction, in developing water resources, in finding 
enough university space to accommodate the Tidal Wave II of students, 
managing demand is likely to be as crucial to any solution as new 
construction. 
In the energy market -- and in electricity particularly -- it's been a 
familiar principle ever since David Roe of the Environmental Defense Fund 
first persuaded Pacific Gas and Electric that a dollar invested in 
conservation may be worth as much as the same investment in new generation. 
But in most other sectors of California's infrastructure, state and local, 
it's a lesson still to be learned. There have been scattered attempts to 
encourage conservation and reduce demand -- significant reduction in water 
use, for example, through the installation of low-flow faucets and low-flush 
toilets; some reduction in traffic by using rush-hour diamond lanes or by 
adjusting highway or (as in New York) bridge tolls to levels of congestion. 
But as pointed out by David Dowall, an urban economist at Berkeley, state 
policy-makers have not really begun to "consider how demand management 
strategies can be applied to infrastructure service areas," or how the more 
efficient use of facilities and more realistic pricing -- highway tolls, say, 
or parking fees -- "can reduce demand for scarce infrastructure resources." 
In any case, says Dowall in one of the PPIC reports, we should pick which 
major projects we will build not just according to per capita estimates of 
how much we need, but according to how much consumers are willing to pay for 
them. 
To avoid hurting the poor, congestion-related highway tolls and other tariffs 
can be rebated on the basis of income. University fees can be means-tested. 
In California, they also could be adjusted to encourage summer school classes 
and other off-peak uses, rather than (as in the past) making UC summer 
courses more expensive. 
Given the political and economic uncertainties, there's no way to know how 
far such demand management can be taken. But there's not much doubt that, as 
Dowall and others point out, the state's infrastructure planning is a jumble 
of uncoordinated agency agendas and wish lists. 
The Legislature last year passed a bill, AB 1473, by Assembly Speaker Robert 
Hertzberg, that requires the governor, beginning next year, to submit an 
annual five-year infrastructure plan for state agencies and public schools, 
along with recommendations on how to fund it. In addition, Gov. Gray Davis' 
infrastructure commission is expected to recommend better coordination of 
infrastructure and land-use planning when it issues its report this spring. 
That would be a start. As California State Treasurer Phil Angelides has 
pointed out, the state desperately needs to start joint planning -- regional 
planning -- for housing, roads and other resources to reduce the need for 
long commutes; to preserve open space; and to bring jobs to where people live 
and housing to where the jobs are. That would itself reduce demand for more 
freeway lanes and, equally important, improve the quality of life. 
At present, most planning for housing, roads, water systems and other 
facilities rarely recognizes the regional impact of local decisions. In the 
East Bay, slow-growth forces push well-intended initiatives that would force 
more development into Tracy or Modesto and further tax the transportation 
systems to Silicon Valley. In city after city, there are beggar-thy-neighbor 
efforts to grab yet another shopping mall that produces a little extra sales 
tax revenue for the city that gets it, and that often compounds traffic and 
revenue problems in adjacent communities. 
In higher education we divide bond proceeds evenly among UC, the California 
State University and the community colleges even though the community 
colleges serve eight times as many students as UC. We plan road projects 
according to county, not regional, priorities. It is all done according to 
antiquated political and fiscal formulas that often no longer make sense. We 
don't just need better capital planning; we need a whole new planning system.

PG&E power plan debated at hearing
A PUC meeting on the utility's capacity expansion project for the Tri-Valley 
follows weeks of protest from officials, residents 
Power upgrade in valley debated 
By Megan Long
TIMES STAFF WRITER 
SAN FRANCISCO -- Dublin officials and the developer of a Livermore 
subdivision faced questions Tuesday about their opposition to alternative 
routes of PG&E's controversial Tri-Valley power upgrade plan -- and answered 
by restating their long-standing objections. 
Tuesday's cross-examination came during the third and likely final week of 
the California Public Utility Commission's evidentiary hearings on the 
utility's $91 million Tri-Valley 2002 Capacity Increase Project. It has 
followed weeks of protests of PG&E's upgrade plans by officials and residents 
of Livermore, Pleasanton, Dublin and San Ramon. 
And before the questioning started, Dublin Vice Mayor Janet Lockhart 
reiterated concerns about an alternative route deemed "environmentally 
superior" that would place a substation just 1,000 feet north of Interstate 
580 between Tassajara and Fallon roads. She said that would undermine the 
results of a 15-year process to plan the eastern development of the city. 
"It's extremely important to the residents of our community to follow a plan 
we worked hard to produce," she said. 
Dublin officials favor PG&E's proposed placement of the station three miles 
north of the freeway, away from new high-tech company offices and housing 
developments. Besides the Dublin substation, the project calls for 
construction of a substation in North Livermore, expansion of the Pleasanton 
substation and installation of 23.5 miles of new lines. 
In response to questions from PUC Administrative Law Judge Michelle Cooke, 
Dublin's public works director, Lee Thompson, confirmed that the Lin family, 
the owner of the property where the alternative substation would go, wasn't 
interested in selling the land to PG&E. 
Cooke also asked Thompson to define a "discretionary permit," which is how 
city officials said they might treat a permit for a substation. Lee said that 
type of permit is one the city has the right to approve or not depending on 
the project's impact. 
Eddie Peabody, Dublin's community development director, testified that the 
zoning for the Lin property accommodates uses such as commercial business, 
research and development and light manufacturing. It would not, he said, be 
appropriate for a power substation. 
He said parcels within the East Dublin area that could host a station would 
include those zoned for public and semi-public uses, including land recently 
bought by Oracle and Sun Microsystems for new campuses. 
While Dublin officials testified that one buyer of land in that area paid $86 
per square foot, others suggested land prices would be inflated to help make 
a PG&E land buy look prohibitively expensive. 
An executive of Centex Homes, the developer of new houses near Isabel Avenue 
and Concannon Boulevard, objected to an alternative route that would place 
high-voltage transmission lines overhead along Isabel and Stanley Boulevard. 
David Barclay, president of Centex's Northern California division, said that 
the 80-foot to 150-foot towers would have a severe visual impact on residents 
of the Prima tract. 
Ed O'Neill, a lawyer for the Kottinger Ranch Homeowners Association, pointed 
out that existing distribution lines on 50-foot poles on Isabel already mar 
the view for residents. 
The Foley family has been ranching on land south of Pleasanton city limits 
for years, said their attorney Kennedy Richardson. The utility's project 
would place overhead lines and a transmission station on rolling hills that 
the family envisions as one day being public open space with limited 
development, Richardson said. 
Lawyers for Pleasanton, Livermore, Kottinger Ranch and Centex are scheduled 
to cross-examine a PG&E engineer today about the project's routing. That 
testimony should be the most controversial of the hearings. Judge Cooke is 
expected to recommend an alignment by July to the PUC, which will make the 
final decision.

State OKs 'Peaker' Power Plant at SFO / Temporary generator could be sending 
electricity to 50,000 homes by August

State energy officials yesterday approved plans to build a temporary 
electrical plant at San Francisco International Airport that should generate 
enough juice to power 50,000 homes by August. 
Meeting in Sacramento, the Energy Commission voted 4-0 to give the green 
light to the gas-fired plant. It will operate during peak summer and winter 
demand to help the state avoid Stage 3 power alerts and rolling blackouts. 
Texas-based El Paso Merchant Energy Co. won approval under a new state law 
mandating speedy, four-month reviews of so-called "peaker" plants. It was the 
only one of seven applications statewide to win approval. The other proposals 
were withdrawn for various reasons. 
The 51-megawatt plant, formally called the United Golden Gate Power Project, 
is scheduled to be built at the northwest corner of the airport near the 
United Airlines maintenance center. 
Within the next few weeks El Paso plans to apply to build a 571- megawatt, 
$400 million plant in the same area, company spokesman Jesse Frederick said. 
It would undergo a separate review by state energy officials. 
The small "peaker" plant approved yesterday is to generate electricity 
beginning around Aug. 1 for up to three years. After the end of three years, 
the plant would be closed or converted to a cleaner-burning system. Under 
state law, a temporary "peaker" plant is permitted to spew more air pollution 
than a permanent plant. 
El Paso's temporary plant is to be built next to a co-generation plant 
operated by United Airlines. It would use existing connections for natural 
gas and water supplies and tap into existing power transmission lines. 
Electricity generated by the plant would be pumped into the state's 
electrical grid, Energy Commission spokesman Gary Fay said. It would also 
serve as a backup for San Francisco Airport in case of a blackout. 
No one spoke against the proposed plant at yesterday's commission meeting. 
The proposal, however, has been criticized by area residents and 
environmentalists worried about air pollution. 
Scott Buschman, a professional photographer and San Bruno resident, said 
yesterday it was unjust that state officials 100 miles away in Sacramento 
approved a Texas company's proposal to put a power plant on land owned by San 
Francisco. 
"The fact that they approved it without considering the public's concerns, 
foremost air quality, is very disturbing," he said. 
Fay said the plant complies with clean-air standards. 
Answering the criticism about the location of yesterday's deliberation, he 
said three hearings and several workshops were held in communities near the 
airport.

Crossed Wires: Major Kinks Emerge In Gov. Davis's Plan To Power California 
--- State's Outlays for Electricity May Be Hard to Recover Without Rate 
Increases --- Betting on Long-Term Deals
By Wall Street Journal staff reporters Rebecca Smith, Mitchel Benson and John 
R. Emshwiller

SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Earlier this year, Gov. Gray Davis made what may be the 
biggest bet in the history of the nation's biggest state: that he could tame 
an out-of-control electricity market and avoid devastating blackouts without 
busting the state's budget, antagonizing its consumers or derailing his own 
political career. 
His wager is still on the table, but the assumptions that underlie it are 
looking increasingly shaky these days. The governor has already spent around 
$2 billion of public money buying hugely expensive wholesale power, taking 
over the role formerly played by the state's near-bankrupt electric 
utilities. And California will probably be obliged to spend billions more 
before its electricity market stabilizes and those utilities are restored to 
some semblance of financial health.
Under the governor's plan, California aims to recoup the money it is using to 
buy electricity by issuing $10 billion in bonds. That way it would still have 
a healthy budget surplus to finance new spending on roads, schools and other 
public services. But there's a potentially big obstacle to this plan. The 
state Legislature, worried about racking up billions in new debt, has put 
limits on the size of any bond offering. In broad terms, the Legislature's 
action would allow the state to borrow only four times as much as it can 
recover annually from utility customers. 
Right now that doesn't appear to be much. Under the current rate structure, 
essentially set in place by California's flawed 1996 electricity-deregulation 
plan, consumers pay far less for power than the cost of acquiring it on the 
wholesale market. Preliminary estimates submitted by utilities last month to 
the California Public Utilities Commission show the state's share of the 
proceeds from electricity sales this year could be as little as $241 million 
-- not enough to support even $1 billion in bond sales under the 
Legislature's formula. 
That would leave the state on the hook for much of the money it has already 
paid for power -- not to mention the billions more Gov. Davis will need to 
spend. That, in turn, raises the prospect that California's economy and its 
credit rating both could deteriorate significantly. But state finance 
officials say that, based on their own projections, they will be able to 
extract enough money to support a $10 billion bond issue. 
Walking a careful line between fiscal prudence and political survival, Mr. 
Davis and others in his administration are scrambling to come up with ways to 
get around the legislative restrictions without raising rates for consumers. 
"If I wanted to raise rates, I could solve this problem in 20 minutes," Mr. 
Davis says. 
The governor says he believes that the state can obtain enough affordable 
power through long-term power-supply contracts to avoid the need for a big 
rate increase. The billions of dollars the state hopes to borrow would be 
used to help pay for power until electricity prices drop, as they are 
expected to do when new power plants come online over the next few years. 
The Davis administration fears that what may be its only other option -- a 
big increase in retail electric rates -- could prompt angry consumer groups 
to seek new electricity laws through a statewide ballot initiative during 
next year's election. That's when Mr. Davis is expected to run for a second 
term as governor. 
But trying to save California without rate increases is forcing Mr. Davis to 
make some colossal gambles with the state's money. State officials estimate 
that in the next several months, California will need to spend as much as $6 
billion on power purchases -- equivalent to the state's entire fiscal 
surplus. Mr. Davis is also looking to spend several billion more to buy the 
transmission assets of three investor-owned utilities in order to restore two 
of them to credit-worthiness. He also has announced plans to spend several 
hundred million dollars more on conservation programs designed to reduce 
demand while new power plants are being built in the state. 
In order to limit the state's financial exposure in the meantime, the 
governor and his aides have, in some cases, ignored state law. They have 
threatened appointed officials who have stood in the way. And they have 
sharply restricted the flow of information to the public. 
None of those steps is expected to do much to reduce state spending on power 
in the coming months. In a few weeks, power usage is expected to begin a 
sharp seasonal rise as Californians switch on their air conditioners with the 
coming of warmer weather. By various estimates, demand during peak periods 
this summer could outstrip supply by 10%, or several thousand megawatts. That 
could produce more rolling blackouts like the ones that hit Northern 
California earlier this year. It is also likely to put strong upward pressure 
on wholesale electricity prices. 
Steven Zimmerman, managing director of Standard & Poor's Corp., says Mr. 
Davis and his aides don't "have a lot of time" to put a cap on the state's 
financial exposure to the crisis. The credit-rating agency has put the state 
on credit watch for a possible downgrade, which would affect the value of all 
of California's outstanding public debt. Moody's Investor Service Inc. is 
also concerned. It said in a recent report that the power crisis could soon 
"seriously threaten the health" of the state's economy. 
Mr. Davis, a Democrat and career politician, was dealt a bad hand when he 
took office in 1999. The deregulation plan that sparked the state's 
electricity crisis was enacted under his predecessor, Republican Pete Wilson. 
But Mr. Davis was slow to react to early signs of trouble this past summer 
and alarms sounded by members of the state Legislature. By the time Mr. Davis 
finally sprang into action earlier this year, a troublesome power-supply 
squeeze had escalated into a crisis. 
In a Jan. 17 declaration of emergency, the governor designated the state 
Department of Water Resources to take the utilities' place as the daily buyer 
of huge quantities of electricity. His hope: that by making the state the 
dominant player in California's power sector, he would ease electricity 
producers' concerns about getting paid and give the state enough clout to 
negotiate lower long-term power prices. 
Earlier this week, Mr. Davis announced final or tentative agreements with 20 
power suppliers to furnish the state with a total of 8,900 megawatts for 
periods of as long as 20 years. But the supply situation remains extremely 
uncertain for this summer, when demand probably will top 45,000 megawatts. If 
the state can secure enough power under contract and push down demand through 
aggressive conservation, it might be able to squeak through the summer 
season. If not, it will be forced to keep buying huge amounts of costly power 
in the cash market. 
Under deregulation, retail electric rates were frozen for several years, 
while wholesale-power costs were free to fluctuate. When the plan was 
conceived, wholesale prices were low and expected to go lower. However, a 
combination of unexpected growth in power demand and a lack of new generating 
capacity helped produce a supply squeeze. Average wholesale prices more than 
tripled last year from 1999. And in January those prices were up 10-fold from 
a year earlier. 
By then, California's two biggest investor-owned utilities -- the Pacific Gas 
& Electric unit of PG&E Corp. and the Southern California Edison subsidiary 
of Edison International -- faced imminent financial collapse. They had racked 
up billions of dollars in wholesale power bills they couldn't afford to pay. 
As generators began shying away from selling to the two utilities, the 
Clinton administration forced them to sell power into the California market, 
an order left in place during the first weeks of the Bush administration. 
Still, northern California was hit by rolling blackouts on several days in 
early January. 
Since then, the DWR, which does some electricity trading as an adjunct to its 
main mission of managing the state's giant system of aqueducts and 
reservoirs, has had to learn the ins and outs of power markets on the run. It 
hasn't been easy. 
David Mills, trading-floor manager for the federal Bonneville Power 
Administration, says the water agency has at times offered to pay $50 to $100 
per megawatt hour more than the available market price. "They agree to prices 
that make you wonder," says Mr. Mills, whose organization markets electricity 
from federal dams in the Pacific Northwest. "You'd at least think they'd 
check to see what the prevailing price is before throwing out their offer." 
Mr. Mills says that "to cut California some slack," he occasionally has 
instructed his traders to sell at prices lower than the DWR had offered to 
pay. 
Ray Hart, the water agency deputy director responsible for the power 
purchasing, says he isn't aware of any cases in which the DWR has overpaid. 
He says his team has been "extremely successful by all measures." 
Ultimately, the DWR's trading acumen is far less important than the overall 
arithmetic of power supply and demand in California. With the price of 
natural gas that feeds many of the region's generating plants at near record 
levels and some suppliers reluctant to sell into the troubled California 
market, wholesale electric prices remain stubbornly high and, in recent days, 
have again been rising. 
The Legislature has advanced the DWR about $3 billion from the state's 
general fund for power purchases. Under emergency legislation passed by the 
Legislature and signed by Mr. Davis on Feb. 1, the general fund is to be 
reimbursed from a planned bond sale later this year. But under terms of the 
emergency law, the water agency would have to wrest $2.5 billion a year in 
revenue from retail electricity rates in order to sell the $10 billion worth 
of bonds sought by Mr. Davis. 
Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, a Southern California Democrat, says the 
formula was created to ensure that there would be a way to repay the bonds 
without draining the state's coffers. "We didn't want to just open our 
wallets," he says. 
According to the language of the Feb. 1 law, the water agency gets what's 
left of revenue collected from ratepayers after the utilities pay certain of 
their own power-supply bills and other expenses. And, in their filings with 
the PUC last month, the utilities reckoned, under their worst-case scenarios, 
that there would be only $241 million available to the DWR this year. 
State officials are quietly pushing the PUC to rejigger the formula so that 
the water department gets more money -- even though that would clash with 
terms of the Feb. 1 law. Robert Miyashiro, deputy director of the Department 
of Finance, says the emergency law was "drafted poorly" and has led people to 
believe the DWR "only gets the leftover money." He predicts there will be 
"cleanup legislation." 
At the request of the Davis administration, the PUC is considering a plan to 
use a different revenue-sharing formula than the one in the state law. The 
proposed new formula was written "in close consultation" with Mr. Davis's 
Finance Department, says PUC President Loretta Lynch, who supports the 
initiative and is hoping to rush it through. 
The effort has drawn some opposition. Commissioner Richard Bilas at a recent 
PUC meeting questioned the legality of the commission attempting to change a 
formula set by the Legislature. PG&E is even more emphatic, since the DWR's 
extra money could come at the utility's expense. The formula "threatens to 
undo the very financial protections for the utilities that [the new law] 
attempted to provide," the utility said in a recent filing with the PUC. 
As politicians and regulators wrestle with that issue, the Davis 
administration has taken a step to reduce the outflow of state cash that also 
seems to conflict with the Feb. 1 law. It was widely assumed that the law 
required the DWR to buy any electricity the state needed to keep its lights 
on. However, on many occasions, the DWR has refused to buy power on the 
grounds that it was too expensive, citing a portion of the new law that urges 
the agency to hold down costs. 
The task of covering any remaining shortfall has passed to the California 
Independent System Operator, which manages the state's energy grid and is 
charged with buying power when necessary to avert shortages. However, the ISO 
doesn't have any power-purchasing money of its own, and the major parties it 
would normally bill are PG&E and Edison, whose inability to pay their power 
bills was the reason the state started buying electricity in the first place. 
Amid criticism of its stance from generators, utilities and Wall Street, the 
DWR says it has started covering more of the utilities' electricity costs. 
The water agency is now buying 95% to 99% of what California needs in a given 
day, says the agency's Mr. Hart. But increased buying only adds to the 
uncertainty about the eventual tab. 
The state's legislative analyst, Elizabeth Hill, recently recommended that 
lawmakers hold off considering more than $2 billion in state spending on 
items ranging from college construction to beach cleanups because of 
continuing questions about the financial impact of the electricity crisis. 
Like others, Ms. Hill complains that the governor's office and state agencies 
haven't been forthcoming with information. 
Indeed, the DWR refuses to say precisely how much power it is purchasing and 
at what prices, though it has on several occasions gone back to the 
Legislature for more money. State officials say that data on its purchasing 
activities would give suppliers an advantage in continuing electricity-supply 
contract talks. 
State Controller Kathleen Connell, who is running for mayor of Los Angeles in 
an April election, recently announced plans to post state power-spending 
information on her department's Web site. But within 24 hours, Ms. Connell 
suspended that plan after discussions with senior Davis administration 
officials. "I feel very strongly that this information should be publicly 
released," says Ms. Connell. "I just don't want to do anything that would 
weaken the state's effectiveness in negotiating." 
In an effort to more tightly control events, the governor obtained 
legislative approval to abolish the 26-member ISO board, which was made up of 
everyone from utility executives to representatives of consumer groups. He 
then appointed a new five-member board. To ensure a quick transition, the 
California attorney general threatened the old board members with fines of as 
much as $5,000 each if they didn't immediately relinquish their positions. 
All did. "I was offended" at the "heavy-handed" treatment, says Karen 
Johanson, a former ISO board member. 
One of the first acts of the ISO's new board was to close a meeting about the 
electricity crisis. The former ISO board routinely held such meetings in 
public. ISO attorneys say the meeting was largely designed as a private 
briefing for new board members and that the organization is committed to 
keeping its deliberations as open as possible. The Wall Street Journal and 
other news organizations have unsuccessfully challenged the closure in 
Sacramento state court.

Calif Controller To Release Power Supply Contract Details  ????
Updated: Monday, May 21, 2001 09:40 AM?ET ?????
?
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--California state Controller Kathleen Connell will 
release details of the state's long-term power supply contracts, including 
the cost per megawatt-hour, during a news conference Monday morning, 
according to her office. 

Connell will also discuss property taxation of utilities and possible 
anticipation of revenues in 2002 at the 2 p.m. EST news conference in 
Sacramento. 

Connell, a Democrat, has said the $13.4 billion in revenue bonds the state 
plans to sell in August to pay for electricity will last through early 2002, 
if power prices are about $195 a megawatt-hour in the summer. However, she 
said she fears prices will be much higher and the bonds will be exhausted 
sooner. 

Connell attempted to release details in February and March on the price the 
state paid to secure long-term power supply contracts, but was told by Gov. 
Gray Davis' administration that if she released the information it could 
jeopardize the deals because of its competitiveness. 

Connell has said the state should immediately stop buying power because of 
the impact it is having on the state's budget and the likelihood that other 
state-funded programs will be cut.

HEADLINE: CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR THREATENS TO TAKE MATTERS INTO HIS OWN HANDS IF
THE GOVERNMENT OFFERS NO RELIEF FOR THE STATE'S ENERGY CRISIS

ANCHORS: JULIE CHEN

REPORTERS: BILL WHITAKER

BODY:

??JULIE CHEN, anchor:

??In energy-starved California, ground zero of the power crisis, the Bush plan
faces sharp criticism. ?Bill Whitaker has that.

??BILL WHITAKER reporting:

??Six times this year lights have gone out in parts of California when heat
triggered a surge in demand. ?Governor Gray Davis deflected the political 
heat,
blasting the Bush energy plan as inadequate.

??Governor GRAY DAVIS (Democrat, California): I fault the president for not
providing California with any immediate relief.

??WHITAKER: In a major power play of his own, Davis has threatened to seize 
the
facilities of Reliant Energy, a Texas-based supplier and major Bush 
contributor,
if Reliant doesn't cut prices.

??Gov. DAVIS: But I told the generators face to face, I said, 'Your fate is in
your hands. ?If you don't help me get through this summer with a minimum of
disruptions, then you leave me no choice but to sign a windfall profits tax 
and
to seize plants.'

??WHITAKER: All five of Reliant's Southern California plants are natural gas
powered, supplying electricity to three million houses. ?Davis has called
Reliant the greediest of all the out-of-state suppliers. ?Reliant wouldn't
comment on camera, but the industry says takeover talk is more political than
economic.

??Mr. JAN SMUTNY-JONES (Independent Energy Producers Association): Seizing
private property didn't work in Cuba and it's not going to work in California,
either.

??WHITAKER: A state takeover of Reliant could backfire, scaring off other
out-of-state generators. ?But analysts say California, which already uses less
energy per capita than any other state, has few options.

??Mr. MARK BERNSTEIN (Energy Analyst, Rand Corp.): The only other thing that
can happen is for the federal government to take action to moderate prices. 
And
if the gov--federal government doesn't take those actions, the governor may 
not
have any choice.

??WHITAKER: Some California legislators suggest creating a buyers' cartel with
Washington and Oregon to jointly muscle down prices and even risk blackouts if
suppliers won't comply. ?So far Oregon and Washington aren't convinced, but
California must do something. ?Last year, electricity cost 400 percent more 
than
the year before. ?And this year, prices are rising still. ?Bill Whitaker, CBS
News, Los Angeles.

REPORTERS: ELAINE KORRY

??ALEX CHADWICK, host:

??California's rushing to get new power plants up and running. ?In January,
Governor Gray Davis used emergency powers to speed the permit process. There 
has
been progress, but NPR's Elaine Korry reports probably not enough to avoid 
more
blackouts this summer.

??ELAINE KORRY reporting:

??Since January, California energy regulators have been slashing red tape to
speed new power plants online. ?Their tracking 180 separate projects. Bob
Thurkelsen, who overseas permitting at the California Energy Commission, says
the governor's emergency directive has already paid off.

??Mr. BOB THURKELSEN (California Energy Commission): And that has allowed us
to, so far, permit 450 megawatts of new generation in a 21-day period.

??KORRY: In a few cases, even quicker than that. ?Jim Michael is the president
of Alliance Power, based in Denver, which sprinted through its permit process 
in
under three weeks.

??Mr. JIM MICHAEL (Alliance Power): Well, we're pouring concrete. ?We're on
schedule, so we're gonna have power plants operating this summer.

??KORRY: Alliance is building two small generators in Southern California.
Michael says permitting projects that used to take months were, instead,
completed in a day or two, allowing the company to meet critical deadlines.

??Mr. MICHAEL: It was essential. ?Without that streamlining, these projects
would have gone away. ?The turbines would have been sold to other projects
outside of California and so we would have essentially failed.

??KORRY: Yet there's still a major hitch. ?Despite the speedup in permitting,
California will still fall far short of the governor's initial goal. ?He 
wanted
5,000 new megawatts of electricity, enough to power five million homes, to 
come
online by July 1st. ?In a worst-case scenario, that's how much additional 
supply
the state would need to keep the lights on this summer. ?Yet only half that
amount, 2,500 megawatts, will be up and running by July. ?Jan Smutny-Jones 
heads
the industry lobbying group the Independent Energy Producers Association. 
?He's
not surprised by the shortfall.

??Mr. JAN SMUTNY-JONES (Independent Energy Producers Association): We said at
the time that was a very ambitious goal. ?And we'll see how it plays out.

??KORRY: Smutny-Jones says blackouts are a near certainty this summer. Their
severity will depend on a number of unknowns. ?How hot will it get this 
summer?
How much more can Californian's skimp on electricity? And how much wattage 
will
the power wholesalers themselves take off line? Power producers have been
charged with deliberately shutting down plants to keep prices high. 
Smutny-Jones
has a different explanation for the down time.

??Mr. SMUTNY-JONES: California's electric power system is rapidly aging. We
have not built a power plant of an appreciable amount in over a decade. ?And
there--while there's power plants being built now, the average age of these
power plants is in excess of 36 years old. ?That's the average age, which 
means
that a significant amount of the fleet is older than that. ?They break down.

??KORRY: The industry, itself, is partly to blame for the aging fleet. The
Energy Commission did license small generators during the 1990s. ?And if 
bigger
ones weren't built, it's largely because the energy producers, themselves,
balked at building them. ?Chris Seiple, with RDI Consulting, says construction
slowed everywhere; that is, until last year. ?Since 2000, he says, 90,000 new
megawatts of energy have come online nationwide. ?That's more capacity in two
years than was built during all of the 1990s. ?And now comes the Bush national
energy policy, urging even greater production. ?According to Seiple, we could
wind up with too much of a good thing.

??Mr. CHRIS SEIPLE (RDI Consulting): So we really expect that in--What?--50
markets we will go from a situation of having shortages to having too much
supply.

??KORRY: In yesterday's speech, President Bush repeated the
administration's claim that the nation will need at least 1,300 additional 
power
plants over the next two decades. ?Seiple says an over supply would drive down
prices, hurting the power wholesalers, but lower energy costs would suit most
ratepayers just fine. ?Elaine Korry, NPR News, San Francisco.

HEADLINE: CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR THREATENS TO TAKE MATTERS INTO HIS OWN HANDS IF
THE GOVERNMENT OFFERS NO RELIEF FOR THE STATE'S ENERGY CRISIS

ANCHORS: DAN RATHER

REPORTERS: BILL WHITAKER

BODY:

??DAN RATHER, anchor:

??There was another blackout in Minnesota just today. ?The power company 
pulled
the plug again on some businesses there, and in Iowa and Illinois, because 
there
just wasn't enough supply to meet the demand. ?The supply problem is even 
worse
in California, and with little or no immediate help coming from the president,
CBS' Bill Whitaker reports the governor is threatening fast, dramatic action.

??BILL WHITAKER reporting:

??Six times this year lights have gone out in parts of California when heat
triggered a surge in demand. ?Today, Governor Gray Davis deflected the 
political
heat, blasting the Bush energy plan as inadequate.

??Governor GRAY DAVIS (Democrat, California): I fault the president for not
providing California with any immediate relief.

??WHITAKER: In a major power play of his own, Davis has threatened to seize 
the
facilities of Reliant Energy, a Texas-based supplier and major Bush 
contributor,
if Reliant doesn't cut prices.

??But I told the generators face to face, I said, 'Your fate is in your hands.
If you don't help me get through this summer with a minimum of disruptions, 
then
you leave me no choice but to sign a windfall profits tax and to seize 
plants.'

??WHITAKER: All five of Reliant's Southern California plants are natural gas
powered, supplying electricity to three million houses. ?Davis has called
Reliant the greediest of all the out-of-state suppliers. ?Reliant wouldn't
comment on camera, but the industry says takeover talk is more political than
economic.

??Mr. JAN SMUTNY-JONES (Independent Energy Producers Association): Seizing
private property didn't work in Cuba and it's not going to work in California,
either.

??WHITAKER: A state takeover of Reliant could backfire, scaring off other
out-of-state generators. ?But analysts say California, which already uses less
energy per capita than any other state, has few options.

??Mr. MARK BERNSTEIN (Energy Analyst, Rand Corp.): The only other thing that
can happen is for the federal government to take action to moderate prices. 
And
if the gov--federal government doesn't take those actions, the governor may 
not
have any choice.

??WHITAKER: Some California legislators suggest creating a buyers' cartel with
Washington and Oregon to jointly muscle down prices and even risk blackouts if
suppliers won't comply. ?So far Oregon and Washington aren't convinced, but
California must do something. ?Last year, electricity cost 400 percent more 
than
the year before. ?And this year, prices are rising still. ?Bill Whitaker, CBS
News, Los Angeles.

HEADLINE: PUC Allegations Detailed;
Hearing: The commission president tells a Senate panel that maintenance 
records
show no valid reason for generators to cut power production.

BYLINE: ROBERT J. LOPEZ, RICH CONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITERS

BODY:

??The head of the California Public Utilities Commission Friday provided fresh
details showing that power generators scaled back electricity production and
then benefited from the resulting high prices.

??In sworn testimony before a state Senate committee, PUC President Loretta
Lynch said the companies' behavior helped drain so much electricity from the
state's grid that officials were forced to declare emergency alerts.

??Lynch's testimony followed her comments Thursday to The Times that state
investigators have found evidence of power plants being shut down 
unnecessarily
to create "artificial shortages," often when the state was most desperate for
electricity.

??During her testimony Friday, Lynch went beyond her assertions about
unnecessary plant shutdowns and accused generators of also needlessly 
throttling
back generation.

??The PUC and state Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer are jointly investigating the
exorbitant wholesale power prices that have cost California billions and 
brought
major utilities to financial ruin.

??Generators have said they never engaged in any conduct intended to 
manipulate
wholesale electricity prices, including unnecessarily shutting down their 
plants
or reducing supply. The facilities, they say, are aging and have run so hard
during the state's crisis that they often require extensive maintenance.

??But the details released by Friday by Lynch added to the questions
surrounding the generators' activities.

??Lynch displayed charts that track electricity prices and power generation at
three plants on a single day last November. After the plants reduced 
production
during the middle of the day, the graphs show, the state was forced to declare
two separate power emergencies because electricity reserves had fallen 
seriously
low.

??The shortfall in supply helped cause a spike in prices. With that, the
companies operating the three plants suddenly increased their electricity
production to almost full capacity, allowing them to capitalize on the much
higher rates.

??"We certainly see a pattern," Lynch told the committee, which is
investigating alleged manipulation of the state's wholesale power market by
energy suppliers. "Many generators are playing on their experience and 
playing,
to an extent, California."

??Maintenance records reviewed by investigators show that there were no valid
reasons for the plants to cut back production, Lynch said. She declined to
identify the power plants involved, saying only that they are owned by at 
least
two companies.

??Sen. Joseph Dunn (D-Santa Ana), who heads the special committee 
investigating
alleged market manipulation, said Lynch's information, on its face, is "very
damning."

??He said his committee has uncovered additional preliminary evidence showing
that several power companies have allegedly engaged in similar behavior.

??"We are looking at data that is suspicious," Dunn said.

??During a break in Friday's hearing, a spokeswoman for a trade group of major
power suppliers said there have been no coordinated efforts to shrink supplies
to increase profits.

??"There has been no collusion," said Jean Munoz of the Independent Energy 
Producers Assn.

??She said many of the plants bought by out-of-state generators under
California's flawed deregulation plan are more than 30 years old. The plants
have been running at high levels to help the state with its energy crunch, she
said.

??Munoz told reporters that the plants owned by out-of-state companies last
year produced 60% more electricity than the previous year.

??Although no firm has been singled out by the PUC or the attorney general's
office, Atlanta-based Mirant Corp. said inspectors have visited company plants
more than 100 times this year and have found no wrongdoing. "Mirant has run 
its
plants voluntarily and continually throughout the crisis," the company said 
in a
statement Friday.

??But Lynch said Friday that visits to more than 80 plants by PUC 
investigators
since December show that generators are not always producing all the power 
they
can.

??"It appears that there have been numerous instances within the past 
half-year
where generation units were not producing the amount of electricity that they
were capable of producing," Lynch said.

Davis Says Bad Guys Went Thataway, to Texas

BYLINE: GEORGE SKELTON

BODY:

??When the lights go dark, this is what Gov. Gray Davis wants us to see:
President Bush and V.P. Dick Cheney smirking as their Texas pals make off with
our money.

??Shutting down power and killing jobs on their way out the door.

??This is pre-summer, a time for creating images that will stay with us 
through
the blackout season and into next year's elections.

??The image Davis is trying to implant in our senses is that of the president
and the power profiteers in collusion. Texans in cahoots. Bush and the 
bullies.

??Actually, it's an easy portrait to paint--an oil landscape with these scenes
reflecting reality:

??Bush and Cheney come from Texas oil backgrounds. Texas energy companies
bankroll Bush running for president. The companies hit a gusher in 
California's
botched deregulation. Our electricity costs soar from $7 billion in 1999 to 
$27
billion in 2000 and may top $60 billion this year. Supply and demand? Demand
increased less than 4% last year.

??Davis pleads for temporary wholesale price caps. Bush and the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission won't hear of it. They also ignore California's findings
of $6.3 billion in gouging.

??Davis has been drawing this picture with increasing fervor--in a Washington
Post op-ed piece, in Saturday's official Democratic response to the 
president's
weekly radio address, in Q&As:

??"Where is that money going? Simply put, into the pockets of the generators
and marketers . . . many of them located in Texas. . . .

??"Mr. President, with all due respect, I urge you to stand up to your friends
in the energy business and exercise the federal government's exclusive
responsibility to ensure energy prices are reasonable. . . .

??"Californians want to know whether you're going to be on their side. . . .
You're allowing the price-gouging energy companies to get away with murder."

??Independent pollster Mark Baldassare puts it in context: "We're at the point
in this crisis where people soon will begin to reassign blame."

??Until now, fingers have been pointed at past actors--former Gov. Pete 
Wilson,
the 1996 Legislature, the private utilities. Now, present performances are 
being
scrutinized--not only Bush's, but especially Davis'. He's vulnerable for 
having
reacted slowly to the emerging crisis last summer.

??A new Baldassare poll being released today by the Public Policy Institute of
California tells the story: The familiar utilities, Wilson and the old
Legislature are blamed by 58% of Californians for the current mess. Davis and
the present Legislature, the enigmatic power generators and the Bush
administration are blamed by only 28%.

??"People are going to stop thinking about what happened five years ago and
start focusing on what's happening this year," Baldassare says. "How will 
those
58% get reallocated? Their attitudes are going to be shaped in the next month 
or
so. That's what all the political maneuvering is about right now."

??It's why Davis is starting to name generators--like Houston-based Reliant 
Energy--and tie them to the president from Texas. It's why he keeps repeating:
"Mr. President, you didn't create this problem. But you are the only one who 
can
solve it."

??Davis also thinks it's conceivable a pressured president will reverse 
himself
and support temporary price caps. If not that, some "creative price relief." 
One
option, he says, is for FERC to acknowledge the massive gouging and order huge
refunds.

??Until lately, Davis had been deferential toward the new president.

??"Initially, the governor felt he could reason with the Bush administration,"
says Garry South, his political advisor. "But he really got ticked off when it
became clear that not only was the administration unsympathetic, but most 
likely
was hanging us out to dry. Especially galling were Cheney's inaccurate and
irresponsible--not to mention haughty--comments about California."

??Cheney recently told The Times he'd oppose price caps even if runaway energy
costs threatened the nation's economy.

??Baldassare's poll shows the political volatility. Davis' job rating has
dropped significantly since January--down from 63% approval then to 46% now,
with 41% disapproval. Only 29% approve of the way he's handling electricity; 
60%
disapprove.

??Bush's job rating is high--57% to 36%--but only 33% approve of his
performance on electricity; 56% disapprove.

??People are focused on this debacle--82% following it "closely" in the news.
Opinions are shifting. Images are being shaped.

??If Bush could open his mind, broaden his ideology and provide price relief--
truly be a compassionate conservative--maybe he'd be a hero.

??If not, Davis will be painting that Texas landscape all summer long.

HEADLINE: Power demands set stage for boom in backup systems

BYLINE: BY JON VAN.

BODY:

??Electricity deregulation is just one trend that's putting a big smile on the
faces of folks at Schneider Electric's North American division in Palatine 
these
days.

??There's also the rapid growth of electronic gear that requires electric
current that flows without interruption or variation, and the concern over
reliability of the public power grid.

??The new complexity is pushing electrical power from commodity status into a
new category as a resource that requires a lot of expertise, and Schneider
executives are devising strategies to take advantage of the new situation.

??Schneider, parent to the Square D brand of electrical control products, is
telling customers that it's short-sighted of them to buy transducers, circuit
breakers and the like from the lowest bidder. Instead, goes this argument, 
they
need to turn over their electrical needs to Schneider to provide an end 
solution
instead of a lot of piecemeal products.

??"We're saying you have to spend money to save money," said Amelia 
Huntington,
Schneider's strategic accounts vice president.

??California's electrical outages and the problems of Chicago's Commonwealth
Edison a few years ago have convinced many business managers of the wisdom of
having a back-up supply of electrical power for when the grid goes dead, she
said.

??Schneider hopes to enter some agreements with customers to own and maintain
electrical infrastructure on their premises in a fee-for-service arrangement
that goes beyond the traditional deal where Schneider sells equipment that a
customer then owns, operates and maintains.

??So far the firm hasn't sealed such a deal, but it has had talks with
customers along those lines, Huntington said. It does have several customers
that have moved away from traditional open bidding relationships with multiple
vendors.

??An example is an IBM plant that uses 130 kilovolts to fabricate computer
chips around the clock seven days a week. Any loss of power, even for a 
fraction
of a second, could cost the plant millions of dollars, Huntington said.

??"Electrical power used to be something that was a given, and manufacturers
didn't think about it much," Huntington said. "But that's changing fast, and 
it
provides us with a marvelous opportunity. We are telling our customers that we
want to be their mini-powerhouse."

??Aflutter over fiber: The upgrade of its phone networks that SBC
Communications Inc. has dubbed Project Pronto is at something of an impasse in
Illinois, but the phone giant is moving ahead with it in Texas and California.

??Executives at Ameritech claim that requirements imposed by the Illinois
Commerce Commission, which call for upgraded network facilities to be shared
with competitors, are unworkable. Consequently, they have declined to use 
Pronto
upgrades to expand the number of customers who can get high-speed Internet DSL
service.

??Elsewhere in SBC territory, the Pronto upgrades are being extended to offer
direct fiber connections to some small businesses. Plans call for SBC to offer
fiber to consumers' homes in the near future.

??While telecom strategists have talked about fiber to the home for about a
decade, SBC's plans mark the most aggressive implementation in recent memory.
Fiber provides so much information-carrying capacity that a single strand of
glass can carry TV programs, high-speed Internet and Napster music downloads
with excess capacity to spare.

??But it may not get much beyond the experimental stage, suggests a local
consultant. Scott Bender, a Chicago-based vice president of Bain & Co., said
that despite the technology lure of bringing fiber to residences, the economic
feasibility of fiber to the home remains elusive.

??The problem, Bender said, is the cost of the equipment that converts the
photons of light that travel on optical fiber into electrons that make
computers, televisions and phones work.

??"Why spend hundreds of dollars for electronics at every home?" Bender asked.
"Instead you can bring fiber into a neighborhood and have one set of 
electronics
handle many customers, using copper wire to make the connection for the last 
few
hundred feet.

??"The fact is that copper can provide all the bandwidth that any home-based
application requires."

??Even though Bender is skeptical that the market is ready for fiber to the
home just yet, he doesn't criticize SBC management for trying it.

??"Every major carrier probably should do experiments like this every few
years," he said. "That way they won't get caught flat-footed when something 
new
finally sticks."

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

BODY:

??Not since the mid-'90s have more Californians believed the state is headed 
in
the wrong direction.

??And it may get worse. ?Nearly 60 percent of state residents expect the
economy to worsen in the next year, while about 40 percent see a brighter
horizon, according to a new poll.

??The telephone survey of 2,001 adult Californians was done over eight days in
early May by the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California. The poll 
was
conducted in English and Spanish.

??The twin culprits were the souring economy and the electricity crisis.

??"Californians clearly see the electricity crisis as a harbinger of other
growth-related problems," said Mark Baldassare, the research institute's 
survey
director. "This crisis and general economic uncertainty have severely 
undermined
public confidence in California's future and in its leaders."

??Change has come swiftly.

??In January, 62 percent of state residents said California was headed in the
right direction, compared to 48 percent this month.

??Other key findings include:

??-82 percent of respondents said population growth over the next 20 years 
will
make California a less desirable place to live.

??-86 percent of respondents said the electricity crisis will hurt the state's
economy.

??-43 percent of respondents favor building more power plants, up from 32
percent in January. The second most popular solution, re-regulating the
electricity industry, was the favored solution in January.

??-Traffic congestion, affordable housing, air pollution and a shortage of 
good
jobs top the list of negative consequences respondents foresee from the 
state's
population growth.

HEADLINE: 'Baseline' becoming key word for electric customers

BYLINE: By KAREN GAUDETTE, Associated Press Writer

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

BODY:

??A little calculation on electric bills is fast becoming a big concern for
millions of residential customers of California's two largest utilities.

??Sitting near the top of Southern California Edison electric bills, and near
the bottom of the last page of Pacific Gas and Electric bills, is a number
called baseline, which guarantees a certain amount of electricity at the 
lowest
price utilities charge.

??This number, which differs from customer to customer based on a host of
factors, is the benchmark for determining how much more residents will pay for
electricity come June - when the largest rate hikes in California history 
start
showing up on bills.

??"Now with deregulation and prices being so much higher, it's going to 
require
that people educate themselves about their bills the same way they had to do
when long distance telephone service was deregulated," said Commissioner Carl
Wood of the Public Utilities Commission.

??Under a rate-hike allocation plan approved Tuesday by the PUC, everyone who
exceeds baseline by more than 30 percent will pay progressively more for that
additional electricity - with the heaviest residential users facing a 37 
percent
average hike on their overall bill, translating to an increase of roughly $85 
a
month.

??State law ensures that residential customers who don't use more than 30
percent above baseline will not face the rate hikes. The PUC figures around 
half
of PG&E and Edison customers now fall into that category.

??But consumer rights groups, and even the utilities, think the PUC is
underestimating residential electric use, given the recent proliferation of 
home
computers, cell phone chargers and the like.

??They think baseline is set too low for many customers, and say families and
people who work at home will pay more than their fair share of the rate hikes.

??"It's an anti-family action. People with kids have a hard time staying 
within
baseline," said Mike Florio, senior attorney with The Utility Reform Network. 
"A
rate hike of 30 to 40 percent could be 100 percent for people with large
households."

??Since 1982, when lawmakers created baseline - given in cents per kilowatt
hour per month - to ensure a minimum amount of affordable power and encourage
conservation, the PUC has determined baseline by dividing the state into
climatic and geographic regions.

??PG&E has 10 such regions within its service territory in northern and 
central
California; Edison has six in central and southern California. 

??The PUC then finds the average amount of electricity use for customers 
within
each region. The baseline quantity is 50 percent to 60 percent of that amount,
and up to 70 percent of that amount during the winter months if a customer 
uses
only one type of energy (electricity or natural gas).

??Customers who depend on electronic medical equipment such as suction,
breathing and dialysis machines, can apply for a slightly higher baseline.

??A family living in the scorching hot Coachella Valley would have a larger
allotment of lower-priced electricity than a family living in breezy Monterey,
given that air conditioning for the former is necessary to survival.

??Since baseline is based on averages, a single apartment dweller and a family
of four who live in the same region could have the same baseline. That makes 
it
more likely for the family to get hit with rate hikes and less likely,
economists fear, that the apartment dweller has a financial incentive to
conserve.

??"Where it is imperfect is that it has no ability to make any adjustments for
the size of the family," said John Nelson, a PG&E spokesman.

??Focusing baseline on household size gets complicated, Florio said. "Does 
PG&E
come by and do bed checks?"

??Along with raising $5.7 billion to replenish the state's general fund for
power buys since January, the rate hikes approved March 27 by the PUC and
allocated on Tuesday were also meant to trigger conservation that could help
avoid rolling blackouts this summer.

??Baseline has not been reassessed since the early 1990s. PUC president 
Loretta
Lynch and fellow commissioner Wood say they may hold hearings as early as this
coming week on possible inequities and ways to update the system.

??"There was plenty of testimony at public hearings that people suspect that
baselines are not appropriate or are not calculated right," Wood said.

??Wood said when baseline first was created nearly 20 years ago, houses were
smaller and many lacked central air conditioning.

??Though the PUC has updated baseline amounts through the years, "living
standards have changed, housing standards have changed and it may be that
average usage is different from what it was," Wood said.

??Florio said giving baselines a second look could go either way for 
consumers.
There are typically more electronic gadgets in homes these days, but many of
those gadgets and appliances are more energy efficient than their ancestors.

??Add that to increased conservation statewide, Florio said, and there's a 
slim
chance baselines could actually go down and expose more customers to rate 
hikes.

??"It's a percentage of average use historically, and people have used energy
more efficiently," through the years, Florio said.

HEADLINE: Grid officials, others studying planned blackouts

BYLINE: By JENNIFER COLEMAN, Associated Press Writer

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO

BODY:

??Could Californians be waking up to hear a weather report, a pollen count and
an electricity blackout forecast?

??It's not out of the question, say some lawmakers.

??"I actually think it's a thoughtful plan ... to give folks an opportunity to
understand the likelihood of blackouts on a daily basis," Assemblyman Fred
Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, the Assembly's point man on energy.

??Keeley compared it to "weather forecasting, to be able to look at the next
three or four days, have a percentile about the likelihood of blackouts."

??The Independent System Operator, keeper of the state's power grid, is
expected to release a report Monday detailing how such a plan would work.

??The idea is "to provide a lot of information so people can make choices to
live with blackouts on a temporary basis this summer," Keeley said.

??Peter Navarro, a University of California, Irvine, economics professor,
released a report last month with a consumer group that recommends the state 
set
a price limit on what they'll pay for power. And if generators don't lower the
price, the state should schedule blackouts to cut consumption, he said.

??The report by Navarro and the Utility Consumers' Action Network says the
state's current method of "highly disruptive random rolling blackouts" needs 
to
be revamped.

??UCAN suggests that the state be divided into blackout zones that utilities
could notify ahead of time that power would be cut at a specific time and for 
a
certain duration.

??Scheduling blackouts could attract criminals to outage areas, Keeley
acknowledged, and possibly could subject the state to legal liability for
traffic accidents or other incidents if power is deliberately shut off.

??"That is a genuine problem and genuine concern," Keeley said. "I think we
would have to work with local governments so they could have a sufficient
advance notice to be able to foresee that and try to deploy their resources
appropriately."

??Critics of the planned blackouts said power producers simply could sell 
their
unused electricity to other states, or trim back production to keep supplies
short.

??Assemblyman Mike Briggs, R-Fresno, plans to introduce a bill this week that
would have the Public Utilities Commission notify businesses and homeowners as
much as one month ahead of time when they would have their power cut.

??"We owe the people of this state some kind of schedule," Briggs said. "If
businesses and individuals knew what days their power could potentially be 
shut
off or blacked out, they could plan for that blackout accordingly."

??The Central Valley Republican said the ability to plan for outages would be
especially benefit farmers, who need power to irrigate their crops.

??Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, who convened a special subcommittee on
blackouts, has also suggested the state should consider scheduling daily
blackouts to cut the state's power use and drive down prices. Democratic
Assembly members plan to introduce their own version of a blackout plan.

??Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Marina del Rey, has said she envisions giving consumers
three to five days notice that their power will be cut during a particular
period, so businesses could opt to shut down or shift their operations to
nonpeak hours such as nights and weekends.

??And by treating blackouts as a first option rather than a last resort, the
state could cut its peak power needs and drive down prices, Bowen said.
California power consumers would in essence form "a reverse cartel to stop the
market manipulation and the price gouging," she said.

??The planned blackout suggestions come as state officials grow increasingly
concerned that power prices will keep rising this summer, even beyond the
extraordinary levels the state already has been paying on behalf of three
cash-strapped privately owned utilities.

??Gov. Gray Davis said the state paid $1,900 per megawatt hour at one point
last week.

??The state has dedicated $6.7 billion since mid-January to purchase power for
Pacific Gas and Electric, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and
Electric. 

??Those expenditures will be repaid this summer when the state issues $13.4
billion in revenue bonds. The bonds will be repaid by ratepayers over 15 
years.

As Energy Prices Rise, So Does the Rancor;
Politics: Gov. Davis says power plan comes at the expense of consumers. Bush
blames Democrats for environmental curbs.

BYLINE: EDMUND SANDERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

BODY:

??President Bush and Democratic leaders decried the rising cost of energy
Saturday, but Bush implicitly blamed Democrats for outmoded environmental
restrictions while Democrats explicitly blamed Bush for favoring the energy
industry over consumers.

??Speaking for Democrats, California Gov. Gray Davis said the energy plan that
the president unveiled Tuesday would do nothing to alleviate the immediate
threats of rising gasoline prices and blackouts in California.

??The president's plan "simply favors more energy production at the expense of
everything else," said Davis, who has unsuccessfully lobbied the Bush
administration to temporarily cap wholesale prices until new power plants can 
be
brought on line.

??Davis, whose popularity has sunk during the crisis, noted that companies 
from
Bush's home state of Texas were the targets of most allegations of 
price-gouging
in California by out-of-state energy suppliers.

??"Mr. President, runaway energy prices are not just a California problem,"
Davis said. "With all due respect, I urge you to stand up to your friends in 
the
energy business and exercise the federal government's exclusive responsibility
to ensure that energy prices are reasonable."

??Bush so far has tried to stay above the fray, letting his aides respond to
criticisms. "It's time to leave behind rancorous old arguments and build a
positive new consensus," the president said Saturday in his weekly radio
address.

??But the rancor is certain to continue. The Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee on Saturday announced the launch of a monthlong radio and television
advertising campaign targeting Republican lawmakers whom they blame for not
doing enough to ease the energy crunch.

??The campaign specifically criticizes Rep. Stephen Horn (R-Long Beach) for
opposing a temporary cap on electricity prices. It is scheduled to start 
Monday
with a 30-second spot that ends with a message urging viewers to call Horn's
offices for immediate action.

??"California's energy crisis is deepening, with summer blackouts predicted 
and
rate hikes of up to 80%," the ad states. "Yet President Bush has offered no
relief to hard-pressed ratepayers. . . . Our representative, Steve Horn, has
joined with Bush in opposing a temporary cap on electricity prices. Call Horn
and tell him we need action now."

??Mark Nevins, a committee spokesman, said the ad campaign is part of an 
effort
to hold Horn and fellow Republicans accountable for lack of leadership on the
energy issue.

??"Horn's party controls the House, the Senate and the White House--and they
have yet to do a thing to provide some immediate relief to California's
families," Nevins said.

??House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) called on Bush on Saturday
to endorse temporary price caps to stop what he termed 10- and even 20-fold
increases in Californians' energy bills.

??Appearing on CNN's "Evans, Novak, Hunt & Shields," Gephardt also said Bush
should have included his tax incentives for energy conservation in the giant 
tax
cut bill that is moving through Congress.

??"The good parts of his plan are not in his budget and not in his tax bill,
which really makes a mockery of what he's really suggesting," Gephardt said.
"We're putting through this week, supposedly, a $1.3-trillion tax 
cut--probably
the biggest tax cut in our history. And there's not a penny in it for the 
energy
stuff that he suggested this week."

??The president's energy plan calls for greater production of power and fuel,
tax breaks for conservation and construction of new nuclear plants.

??Two of its most controversial elements are opening Alaska's Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge for drilling and giving federal agencies power to force
landowners to sell property needed for new electricity transmission lines.

??Responding to growing complaints from environmentalists, Bush insisted that
new technologies would enable the nation to boost energy production without
hurting the environment.

??"Too often, Americans are asked to take sides between energy production and
environmental protection," Bush said. "The truth is, energy production and
environmental protection are not competing."

Spencer Abraham Is Running on Energy, Not Charisma;
Profile: Charged with selling Bush's initiative, 'workhorse' new to the field 
is
facing a hard row.

BYLINE: FAYE FIORE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

BODY:

??Now that President Bush's energy plan has been pondered, penned and rolled
out, the task of selling it to the American people falls in large part to a
48-year-old father of three who drives a green Chrysler minivan and jokes of
having "a face made for radio."

??Spencer Abraham, the man who accepted the job of Energy secretary knowing
precious little about energy, takes his place as promoter in chief for the 
plan
designed to "finally put America on the right course," as he likes to put it.

??It was Vice President Dick Cheney who conceived the 105-point blueprint,
engineered over pots of coffee at an ornate 19th century table in his office.
Now Cheney cedes the spotlight to Abraham, a self-described "workhorse, not 
show
horse" whose admitted lack of charisma helped cost him his Senate seat last 
year
after just one term as a Michigan congressman.

??Abraham, the grandson of Lebanese immigrants, wears his shoes until they 
wear
out and gets haircuts when his staff reminds him. His idea of a good time is 
hot
dogs with his wife, son and twin daughters in the food court of a Virginia
shopping mall.

??"It's not a charismatic plan, so it doesn't require a charismatic guy," said
William Kristol, editor of the conservative Weekly Standard magazine who 
served
with Abraham on former Vice President Dan Quayle's staff. "He is of
working-class origins; not a glib talker. He'll have a shrewd sense of how to
sell this plan, as well as a real understanding of it."

??On the eve of the energy plan's unveiling Thursday, Abraham was the only
administration spokesman trotted out for the network news. Friday he made the
rounds of morning TV news shows, delivering the party line that conservation
alone will not solve the problem, that more energy sources must be generated.

??And on the Op-ed pages of Friday's Wall Street Journal, he sought to counter
complaints that the plan is anti-environment and would only help big business.

??"Americans love and want an unlimited supply of affordable energy, but they
don't like virtually each of the sources that provide it," Abraham said in a
recent interview. "Coal is too dirty, nuclear isn't safe, hydropower kills 
fish,
windmills threaten birds."

??His mission is to persuade the people otherwise. It is a job that comes with
little power and lots of room for blame.

??The Department of Energy, which then-Sen. Abraham sought to abolish in 1999,
shares splintered authority with several other agencies. What it does command 
is
often controversial: the nuclear weapon labs that came under scrutiny after
security breaches at its Los Alamos, N.M., facility and oversight of the
nation's aging nuclear arsenal.

??But his greatest challenge is likely to come this summer in California, when
anticipated electricity shortages will cause the lights to go out, air
conditioners to shut down and whopping utility bills to arrive in the mail.

??Then Abraham is poised to become California's pinata, the federal official
who gets the stick because, Bush administration critics will argue, the 
federal
government has failed to deliver the caps on wholesale power rates that Gov. 
Gray Davis and others have sought.

??"The public is getting ready to be hit with a rate increase, and they are
going to be mad as the devil," said a former member of Congress familiar with
energy policy who declined to be identified to avoid offending the
administration.

??Critics point to Abraham's lack of energy background as his greatest
weakness. But what Abraham brought to his post--and what should serve him
well--is political savvy, his supporters say. He headed the Michigan state
Republican Party during most of the 1980s and joined Quayle's staff in 1990. 
He
returned to Michigan to launch his Senate bid in 1993 and rode 1994's 
nationwide
GOP tide into office.

??Abraham's voting record generally reflected the GOP congressional agenda: He
loyally opposed abortion rights and favored free trade; his environmental 
record
earned him the Sierra Club's lowest rating. But he made his mark by 
successfully
challenging party leaders when they sought to reduce legal immigration to the
United States.

??He spent more time working in the back rooms of Congress than in its
limelight. He likes to tell the story of one early turn presiding over the
Senate when he forgot about the live microphone and was caught on C-SPAN 
humming
the children's song, "Do You Know the Muffin Man?"

??His supporters note he's a quick study, a Harvard-educated lawyer who has
mastered the subject of energy in mere weeks. He starts work early and stays
late, presenting his staff with checklists of things to do and ideas to 
explore.
He has a knack for distilling an arcane science into language the public can
understand.

??He may need all the communication skills he can muster to confront one of 
his
most awkward tasks: telling the nation's most populous state it must solve its
energy problem largely on its own.

??"California keeps saying, 'Why won't Washington do something?' " Abraham
said, reiterating his opposition to electricity price caps he believes will 
only
prolong the crisis. But he added: "The first call I made as secretary of 
Energy
was to Gov. Davis. . . . We're not leaving any stones unturned."

??If Abraham was not practiced in front of the camera in his early career, he
seems to be now. His performance has earned high marks at the White House, 
aides
said.

??Not much briefing was required before he traveled with Bush to Minnesota for
the energy plan's debut. He already knew the material, a staff member said. 
And
he had gotten a haircut.

Davis Launches Conservation Campaign;
Electricity: Governor hands out fluorescent lightbulbs in his effort to get
Californians to save power this summer.

BYLINE: DALONDO MOULTRIE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

BODY:

??Gov. Gray Davis' visit to Estella Burnett's Venice home Saturday had nothing
to do with her steps at conserving energy. She was already doing her part.

??But Davis asked her to do more.

??The governor stopped at one other home in Burnett's neighborhood to help
distribute compact fluorescent lightbulbs as part of the kickoff of 
"PowerWalk,"
a program designed to encourage California residents to conserve electricity 
during the state's energy-strapped summer.

??Members of the California Conservation Corps began distributing the energy
efficient bulbs across the state Saturday. The plan is to deliver 1.5 million 
of
them door-to-door in the next 17 weeks.

??The effort was welcomed at homes in Venice but residents, including Burnett,
said more needs to be done.

??"I think the lightbulbs might help, but it's up to us to conserve," Burnett
said after Davis left her home, adding that the Legislature can also do more.
"They can build more power plants so we don't have to take up their slack."

??Conservation Corps members also visited the home of Owen Thomas, 25.

??The idea of handing out the bulbs struck Thomas as a novel, proactive way to
spread the message of energy conservation, he said.

??To maximize his energy conservation efforts, Thomas limits his use of 
lights,
he said. But he said still more needs to be done.

??"I doubt that's how people use [the bulk of] their energy," Thomas said.

??He said he cuts back on use of lights and his computer and doesn't use his
air conditioners.

??Davis also paid a visit to the home of John Ghanie, 58, who lives across the
street from Burnett.

??Ghanie said Davis' PowerWalk campaign is a good idea but he, too, believes
other steps must be taken.

??"I think he is trying to do something," Ghanie said. "It should have been
done years ago. The lightbulbs are good, but we need [power] plants. This is
like a Band-Aid. We need a cure."

??Davis said he is committed to providing more energy to the state by
authorizing construction of 15 plants, 10 of which are being built.

??He said California legislators are doing all they can to fight the energy
battle.

??President Bush needs to step in and help California deal with the crisis,
Davis said.

??Burnett, 66, said she is happy to help in attempts at conservation. "I wash
clothes at night," she said. "We very seldom turn on the television; only to
turn on the news. I use the dishwasher maybe once every other week."

HEADLINE: One year later, we know it wasn't just a simple game of golf

BYLINE: Dan Walters

BODY:

??California will mark - but certainly not celebrate - an anniversary this
week. It was exactly one year ago that a late spring heat wave swept over San
Diego, and as air conditioners began drawing heavy amounts of power, San Diego
Gas & Electric Co. began charging its customers high, market-oriented rates 
for
juice.

??It was the beginning of the California energy crisis, or at least of public
and political awareness that something was wrong. And a year later, every 
aspect
of the crisis continues to grow worse. We are paying 10 times as much for 
power
as we were two years ago. We have amassed more than $20 billion in private and
public debt that will grow even with sharp increases in consumer power rates.
And we face potentially life-threatening summer blackouts.

??Certainly the roots of the crisis extend much further than one year. They go
back to decisions in the 1970s to stop major power plant construction and rely
on conservation and alternative generating sources. And they include a 
momentous
decision in the mid-1990s to adopt a "deregulation" plan that was an 
unworkable
hybrid of open markets and price controls that left us at the mercy of
out-of-state generators. Of more currency is what was and wasn't done in the
last 12 months to fan that spark into a uncontrolled, and perhaps
uncontrollable, firestorm.

??Gov. Gray Davis once said that he was approaching energy just as he plays
golf, "one hole at a time." Unfortunately for Davis, and for the state, it was
not a golf game, but one of three-dimensional, and perhaps four-dimensional,
chess. To manage the crisis effectively, the Democratic governor needed the
ability, either personally or through trusted aides, to pull together its
disparate elements into a cohesive whole.

??The golfing approach was evident from the beginning, as Davis dealt with 
only
the most immediate aspects of the situation as they evolved, rather than
embracing it wholly and actively. Private and public energy experts warned 
that
what was happening in San Diego was a harbinger of a larger crisis and 
proposed
that the 1996 "deregulation" be suspended, that rates be raised slightly and
that private utilities be given broad authority to enter into long-term supply
contracts to stabilize the market. But Davis and his handpicked state Public
Utilities Commission president, Loretta Lynch, stalled for time.

??Less than a month after the crisis first surfaced, the PUC voted 3-2 to
authorize long-term supply contracts at about 5 cents a kilowatt-hour - 
slightly
higher than wholesale prices had been, but ridiculously cheap by contemporary
standards. Publicly owned utilities saw the looming price escalation and 
quickly
locked up long-term supplies, but Lynch denounced the commission action as "a
wrong turn" that could lead to higher consumer bills, and within days it was
scuttled in legislation signed by Davis.

??Rather than face the issue comprehensively and proactively, Davis, Lynch and
the Legislature opted for an expedient fix in San Diego, rolling back retail
rates without addressing either supply or cost issues. Within weeks, private
utilities were beginning to take on billions of dollars in debt as wholesale
costs skyrocketed.

??Last summer's failure to act was compounded by other errors of judgment. 
It's
clear now, for example, that it was a mistake for the state to continue buying
power at sky-high rates when the utilities had exhausted their credit. Having 
a
new deep pocket encouraged the generators to charge whatever the market would
bear.

??A year after he could have nipped the crisis in the bud, but didn't, Davis 
is
busily rewriting history and blaming others, principally Republicans, for the
dilemma. But the governor cannot, or should not, escape the responsibility for
approaching this very complex situation like a game of golf, or like some
routine political dispute, and thus failing to apply the aggressive and
sophisticated managerial touch that this crisis demanded from the onset.

??As Gen. George McClellan discovered at the Battle of Antietam during the
Civil War, the unwillingness to take risk often leads to greater carnage.

Investigations;

Power firms fueled by greed, Lockyer says;

Out-of-state generators face multiple probes

SOURCE: Sacramento Bureau Chief

BYLINE: Greg Lucas

DATELINE: Sacramento

BODY:
Up the road in Folsom, at the nondescript headquarters of the Independent 
System
Operator -- monitor-in-chief of California's energy grid -- they have a new 
job:
responding to more than 40 detailed subpoenas.

???The data the ISO keeps on electricity transactions are central to the
half-dozen investigations initiated by state and federal agencies into various
parts of the state's energy mess, including possible criminal activity by 
power
generators.

???"They're asking for everything and then some," a spokeswoman for the ISO,
Stephanie McCorkle, said, sighing.

???The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the state Public Utilities
Commission, the Assembly, the Senate, the state attorney general and a phalanx
of state and federal auditors all are boring into California's energy mess.

???The main thrust of the most significant investigations is the conduct of
power generators that have reaped record profits selling electricity to the
electron-starved state.

???Although most investigators say the ISO's logs and bid records show the
various generators used their market share to drive up prices, the issue is
whether they did so acting collaboratively, either directly or indirectly.

???Generators deny any manipulation of the market. They say their prices 
simply
reflect a lack of supply, plant breakdowns and the high cost of natural gas.

???But that hasn't stopped the state from trying to prove them wrong.

???Attorney General Bill Lockyer has been probing the actions of the 
generators
since August to see if they manipulated the market or engaged in unfair 
business
practices or if their executives engaged in criminal behavior.

???"We all feel we've been taken advantage of, been gouged," Lockyer said. 
"The
question is whether it's legal greed or illegal greed. There's no question 
it's
greed."

???Lockyer is in court fighting energy companies like Reliant Energy Inc. and
Dynegy, which have refused to disclose internal company information that 
Lockyer
subpoenaed Feb. 15.

???The power companies say they are not receiving assurances the documents
Lockyer wants will be kept confidential.

???Lockyer said he hopes to complete his spadework on the generators this
summer.

???The PUC also is probing whether generators timed maintenance and shutdowns
to drive up prices.

???On Thursday, PUC President Loretta Lynch said investigators found patterns
of plant shutdowns that created "artificial shortages."

???Lockyer insisted that "no one yet has sufficient evidence to win a civil or
criminal suit. But we're probably further along than any other investigative
effort."

???Generators say they are cooperating with the investigations -- except for
worries about proprietary information becoming public -- and flatly reject the
notion they have been gaming the market or acting in concert.

???"We naturally would take serious issue with some of those allegations," 
said
Richard Wheatley, a spokesman for Reliant Energy in Houston. "It doesn't 
compute
because we all compete against each other. We don't cooperate, share 
information
or anything of that nature. It's not only illegal but unethical to do so."

???Said Chuck Griffin, a Mirant Corp. spokesman: "Any patterns would exist
because of the rules they established long before Mirant was in California."

???A new investigation of the generators is being done also by the aptly named
Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation in the Wholesale
Energy Market. It too is meeting resistance from generators in handing over
documents they consider confidential.

???"Discussions thus far in that regard have been disturbing, and right now
we're at an impasse," said Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, the committee's 
chairman.

???Dunn's committee can only gather facts and make recommendations on new laws
if it uncovers some kind of anti-competitive activity not already covered by 
the
law.

???So far, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is the only entity to
impose any economic pain on generators.

???After a probe of California's power market last summer, the commission
issued an order in December that created a mechanism by which generators would
have to justify prices above a certain level determined by the commission.

???In March, the commission said generators had to justify $124 million in
charges -- or reimburse the money.

???It also reached an $8 million settlement with AES Southland and Williams
Energy Marketing & Trading over power plants that were supposed to be running
but weren't.

???Critics, from Gov. Gray Davis down, say that generators owe many millions
more in refunds.

???Several other investigations are either under way or completed.

???The PUC is investigating whether the holding companies of Pacific Gas and
Electric, Southern California Edison and Sempra Energy in San Diego violated 
the
requirement that the utility be their first spending priority.

???The investigation came after discoveries that while PG&E and Edison were
accumulating huge debts buying power, they were also transferring hundreds of
millions to their parent companies.

??--------------------------------------------------------------------------

???Probes sparked by power crisis

???Here's a look at some of the investigations California's power crisis has
sparked and their status:

???Market manipulation by power generators -- The Public Utilities Commission,
attorney general and a special Senate committee are all investigating
allegations.

???High prices charged by generators -- The Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission said in March that generators must justify $124 million in possible
overcharges or refund the money. The investigation is still open.

???Investor-owned utilities transferring large sums to their holding companies
-- The PUC is examining whether any regulations were violated.

???The flaws of electrical deregulation -- The state auditor general completed
a report in March.

???Audits of the utilities -- A report concluding utilities transferred
millions to parent companies was released in January by the PUC.

???Price spikes in natural gas -- An Assembly committee issued its report last
week, saying El Paso Corp. manipulated the market.E-mail Greg Lucas at

HEADLINE: Power juggling ramped up price;

Insiders say manipulation also strained equipment

SOURCE: Chronicle Staff Writers

BYLINE: Christian Berthelsen, Scott Winokur

BODY:
Large power companies have driven up electricity prices in California by
throttling their generators up and down to create artificial shortages,
according to dozens of interviews with regulators, lawyers and energy industry
workers.

???Those sources say the unusual maneuvers not only jacked up prices but also
wore down equipment and contributed to the record levels of plant shutdowns 
that
are depriving the state of much-needed electricity. The accounts are supported
by an independent review of shutdown data by The Chronicle.

???The California Energy Commission calculates that an average of 14,990
megawatts of generating capacity, nearly a third of the state's total, was
unavailable each day in April because of plant shutdowns, more than four times
as much as a year ago.

???Such shutdowns are the subject of increasing scrutiny as California enters
another period of high demand, the warm spring and summer months of May to
September, when electricity usage normally grows by a third.

???Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission, 
said
last week the agency has found considerable evidence of suspicious plant
shutdowns. And the California Independent System Operator, which manages the
state's power grid, says plant shutdowns have now become the primary means of
constricting supply.

???But an extensive investigation by The Chronicle has found that not only 
were
generators shut down to boost prices but these "gaming" tactics contributed to
the plants' deteriorating condition.

???"We suspected it," said Jim MacIntosh, the manager of grid operations for
the ISO. "It was a sure factor in driving up prices." Such swings in unit
output, he said, "would only make sense in a scenario when they're trying to
game something. Otherwise, why would they do that? They're tearing their units
up."

???Unusual phone calls

???Operators at a San Bernardino County power plant owned by Reliant Energy
Inc. say a complex plan to manipulate the California energy market began early
last year with a series of unusual telephone calls from the company's
headquarters in Houston.

???According to the accounts of three plant operators, Reliant's operations
schedulers on the energy trading floor ordered them to repeatedly decrease, 
then
increase output at the 1,046-megawatt Etiwanda plant. This happened as many as
four or five times an hour. Each time the units were ramped down and 
electricity
production fell, plant employees watched on a control room computer screen as
spot market energy prices rose. Then came the phone call to ramp the units 
back
up.

???"They would tell us what to do, and we would do it," said one of the men,
who only agreed to speak on condition they not be identified because they fear
being fired. "Afterward, we would just sit there and watch the market change."

???The workers said frequent and large swings in electricity output began at a
number of California power plants just as the state's power crisis began in
earnest. The workers and state power authorities assert the swings were one of
the primary means of gaming the wholesale energy market.

???"It appears the control rooms are responsive to direction from the trading
floors in Houston, rather than the reliability needs of the ISO," said Carl
Wood, a commissioner with the utilities commission who is overseeing that
agency's investigation into plant outages. "Instead of being responsive to
demands for reliability, they're responsive to demands for profitability."

???Corporate denial

???Reliant officials adamantly deny using this tactic or any other mechanism 
to
game the California energy market. They and other power companies, including 
AES
Corp. and a partnership between NRG Energy Inc. and Dynegy Inc., have asserted
that skyrocketing electricity demand forced them to run aging, decrepit power
plants harder than ever to meet California's needs.

???While acknowledging that the company issued changes in output levels as
frequently as every 10 minutes, company officials said it was done at the
instructions of the ISO to maintain supply-demand balance.

???"As a part of routinely doing business within California and the California
market design, we are required to do that," said Kevin Frankeny, an operations
official with Reliant. "When the ISO (issues dispatch orders), they dispatch 
on
a 10-minute basis. It can go up and down many times within an hour."

???Frankeny said he was not aware of any instances in which Reliant schedulers
in Houston ordered dispatch changes without the ISO directing them to do it
first.

???The ISO refused to comment on operations at any specific facility, but
Stephanie McCorkle, an ISO spokeswoman, said the ramping tactics were used
beyond dispatch instructions during periods of tight supply. And one of the
plant operators said the orders to vary output came independently of the grid
managers. "ISO was not calling Reliant every 10 minutes for that," said one of
the operators. "Not for an individual unit."

???Officials with the California attorney general's office declined to comment
on the legality of the ramping practice, citing a continuing investigation 
into
whether wholesale energy prices are being manipulated. One source familiar 
with
the state of various inquiries said the ramping, if proved to have been done 
to
drive up prices, could violate the state's unfair business practices laws.

???Invisible practice

???How could companies such as Reliant tinker with output and not get caught?

???One of the plant workers said the practice was designed to be virtually
invisible to regulators and grid operators.

???When power companies bid on hourly contracts, they agree to produce a
certain amount of electricity over the given hour. Generators are paid based 
on
an average of the spot market prices for that hour. By driving up the spot
price, they can increase their hourly profits and still produce the total 
amount
of energy required.

???The plant worker said the units would be ramped down immediately after 
their
output measurement, which was performed at the top of each hour by the ISO.
Then, he said, it was brought back up as the spot market price of electricity
rose in response to the reduced output. By the time the ISO measured again, 
the
output was back at the expected level.

???Another operator said the units were not always ramped up and down - that 
if
the price reached a satisfactory level, generators would raise output and 
remain
at that level as long as the price was right. Other times, if the price was 
low,
output was brought down and kept down.

???The same operator said the amount of ramping appeared to be a matter of
individual will of the company schedulers in Houston, with some being more
aggressive than others.

???"What they would do, especially late at night, is if the price tanked, they
would undergenerate," an operator said. "Then, mysteriously, the price would 
go
up.

???"Then, if the schedule was at 70 (required megawatt hours of output), 
they'd
say, 'Go up to 90.' That would cause the price to tank. And they'd say, 'Bring
it down again.' "

???Rapid changes

???These fluctuations occurred within time spans of as little as 10 to 15
minutes, the operators said. But acceptable rates for bringing a unit from
minimum to maximum levels when the plant was owned by Southern California 
Edison
were more like 80 minutes, to avoid stressing the machinery, one of the 
workers
said. Moreover, they were typically run at constant levels, which also reduced
wear and tear.

???"They were basically ramping up as fast as they can, and then slamming the
brakes on," said one of the operators. "They were increasing the fatigue on 
the
units."

???ISO officials say they changed market operations last fall to crack down on
gaming tactics, including instituting a so-called 10-minute market, rather 
than
the hourly market, so that it could be more easily detected when companies 
were
withholding power.

???But the ISO says generator outages have now become the primary tactic in
driving up energy prices.

???A computer analysis by The Chronicle of shutdown data over a recent 39-day
period shows Reliant and three other generating companies topped the list of
plant shutdowns. Reliant also represented the largest amount of wattage lost
among those companies.

???Plants owned by Reliant, AES, Mirant Corp. and Duke Energy Inc. accounted
for more than half of the state's unplanned shutdowns, even though their
generating capacity was no more than 25 percent of the state's total capacity
from all sources.

???Reliant, one of California's largest and most profitable out-of-state
generators, reported 319 shutdowns during the period in March and April. It 
was
followed by Mirant Corp. of Atlanta (310), AES Corp. of Arlington, Va. (278) 
and
Duke Energy North America of Charlotte, N.C. (261).

???Reliant's unplanned shutdowns deprived the system of more than 53,000
megawatts over the 40-day period, an average of 1,368 per day - enough power 
for
1.4 million homes for one hour.

???Its Ormond Beach plant in Oxnard, with one generating unit down for 26 
days,
accounted for more than 30,000 of those missed megawatts. However, an operator
who worked in that plant said the outages there appeared to be the result of
legitimate equipment failures.

???Reliant says there are valid reasons for its plants now to be in need of
repair. They are old: At 48, Etiwanda is the oldest of Reliant's five 
California
plants. And the company says routine maintenance was deferred so the plants
could remain in service during times of high summer demand.

???But the operators said the issue is not so clear-cut. One problem at
Etiwanda, a tube leak, had been present for about a month and was previously
reported to management, they said, but it had not deteriorated much, it was
operating at full capacity and there was no immediate need to take the unit
offline because of the problem.

???Moreover, at the time of the shutdown, the ISO had expressly asked Reliant 
to keep the unit online, the operators said. Richard Wheatley, a spokesman for
Reliant, denied that any Reliant unit was taken offline for unnecessary
maintenance.

???Ramping may be rampant

???Sources say Reliant was not alone in using the ramping practice. A source
familiar with the state utilities commission investigation said output logs
obtained from AES' Alamitos plant also reflected production fluctuations. And 
an
operator who has worked at the El Segundo plant co-owned by NRG and Dynegy 
said
the practice was used there, although less frequently. The scheduling calls 
came
from Dynegy's trading floor in Houston, rather than NRG in Minneapolis, he 
said.

???Steve Stengel, a spokesman for Dynegy, said changes in output at El Segundo
were a normal function of changing demand levels throughout the day, and 
denied
the company was engaged in gaming the California market.

???In a May 2000 report, the California Energy Commission cited Reliant's 
Etiwanda plant, as well as the Alamitos and El Segundo plants, as some of the
"major beneficiaries of high real-time prices" that spring.

???One way to obtain those high prices, the plant workers said, was the simple
method of demanding a sky-high price and refusing to deliver power if that 
price
was not met.

???On one occasion, one operator said, Reliant ordered a unit at Etiwanda to 
be
shut off because the ISO would not meet the price of $1,000 per megawatt hour,
even though the legal price cap at the time was $750.

???"The operator said, 'It's our unit, shut it off,' " the source said.

On energy;

Conservation's value: It's not all sacrifice

BODY:
IN ENERGY-SPEAK, conservation can be a dangerous word. The White House 
point-man
on energy, Vice President Dick Cheney, demonizes the term to heap scorn on
anything short of more drilling and mining.

???For Gov. Gray Davis, conservation also gets special handling. Too much
emphasis on lower thermostats and higher gas mileage and voters start thinking
painful sacrifice and a lower standard of living. The image of President 
Carter
swaddled in a cardigan, talking up frugal consumption was a political disaster
for Democrats.

???Small wonder that neither party is enthusiastic about conservation. But
saving energy -- electricity, natural gas and oil -- has never been more
necessary and obtainable.

???Thrift, efficiency and innovation aren't threats to the economy or anyone's
lifestyle. Conservation needs serious advocacy, not lipservice.

???There is no better place to boost energy savings than in California, the
cynosure of the power crisis. The shortage has the potential to direct
California toward power efficiency on an even greater scale. Generation,
transmission and pricing are all under the microscope.

???Already, this state is a leader, with the second-lowest per capita use of
energy in the nation, thanks to building and lighting guidelines pioneered 
over
the last several decades. California now has no choice but to stay out front.

???Appliances, industrial and farming equipment, transportation and building
codes were revolutionized by the oil shortages of the 1970s. The state drew up
car manufacturing guidelines mandating alternative fuels to boost mileage and
cut tailpipe smog. Jobs were created.

???The efficiencies were partly dictated by price, as consumer costs surged
during the Arab oil embargo and then the Iranian revolution. Buyers wanted
products with smaller energy appetites and manufacturers responded.

???But government also played a major role. The state set up rules to spur
industry to squeeze more results out of less energy. These directives worked: 
a
soda can is just as cold in a new refrigerator using a third of the juice of a
'70s era model. Mandated insulation, fluorescent lighting and
weatherstripping pay off. There's no sacrifice in comfort or performance.

???Amid the current power shortage, this message is only partially sinking in.
For months, Sacramento has dithered through a debate that has rung up a $6
billion price tag, the sum paid out by the state to buy power. None of this
money has gone to conservation.

???This week, higher rates were approved by state regulators to repay the
enormous outlays in energy buys and also to send a price signal to users. 
Higher
rates should be a strong impetus to conserve.

???But bigger bills aren't the total solution. For one thing, the rates were
reworked to favor industrial users, the same group that pushed the state's
disastrous deregulation plan that underlies the shortage. For this group to
receive special treatment is unconscionable.

???At best, the money buys time to get California through a blackout-prone
summer. Up to a dozen new power plants are under construction, with the hope
that by next year supply will be in balance with daily demand. Plainly, the
state badly needs to find new power and its power infrastructure should be
updated.

???But the mad scramble for electrons risks missing out on a larger 
opportunity
to devise rules, require new equipment and encourage methods that conserve
power. A long-term initiative to build-in conservation is missing. The Bush
energy plan does little on this score.

???Instead, conservation is being treated tentatively. Gov. Gray Davis has
directed $800 million toward nearly a dozen energy-saving programs. These
include buybacks of inefficient refrigerators and air conditioners, 
replacement
of older agricultural water pumps and weatherizing upgrades for low-income
homes.

???These are reasonable steps to soften an immediate crisis. Already the
state's energy use has dropped by 7-to-9 percent through public awareness of 
the
power shortage.

???But conservation needs a more vigorous push from Davis and Bush. What's
missing is long-range thinking, a willingness to legislate changes and 
political
courage.

???Consider the "qualifying facilities," or small, independent power plants
that feed into the state's market. For months, these generators -- many using
alternative methods such as wood waste, wind or small gas turbines -- have 
been
stiffed by cash-poor big utilities. The small suppliers have largely shut 
down,
worsening the statewide shortage and crimping an industry competing with big
generators. Davis should make every effort to restore the small producers to
financial health.

???Another opportunity is technology. For decades, the homely electric meter
has stayed pretty much the same, measuring the monthly energy use of homes and
businesses. What if this caveman gizmo were modernized and could give users an
hour-by-hour picture of energy habits?

???On a grander scale, gas mileage needs re-thinking. The Bush energy package
steered attention to its subsidies for alternative-fuel cars, but ignored the
biggest challenge: plugging loopholes that allow SUV's and light trucks to 
burn
more gas than cars.

???Research and governmental directives have made vehicles safer and more
thrifty to operate. A continued push from Washington could innovate even
further, if the president was genuinely concerned about conservation.

???Ending the energy crisis will likely take a batch of ingredients. In
predicting the future, many analysts bank on a mix of solutions: new power
plants, higher rates, state bonds to spread out $13 billion in power buys, 
and,
finally, conservation. It's a term that usually comes last.

???But a longe-range strategy needs devising that will enable California's
homes, factories and farms to conserve on power use. The state has faced the
challenge before and triumphed. It's time to try again.

Blockbuster Deal Sowed Seeds Of Enron Fiasco
2002-01-17 23:05 (New York)

  By Rebecca Smith 
  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 

  When Enron Corp. and Blockbuster Inc. joined forces in mid-2000, it looked
like they were onto something big. The companies announced they would soon be
allowing consumers across America to choose from among thousands of movies,
including hot new features, sent via telephone lines to watch on their TVs at
home. 
  Announcing the partnership in July 2000, Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay called it
the "killer app for the entertainment industry." Blockbuster Chairman John
Antioco said the two companies had come up with the "ultimate
bricks-clicks-and-flicks strategy." Oracle Corp. Chairman Larry Ellison later
committed his private company, nCube Corp., to provide critical computer
hardware and $2 million. Mr. Ellison said he was "proud" to be part of the
venture. 
  It looked like another brilliant move by Enron, already a hero on Wall
Street. The Houston company had aligned itself with the nation's leading video
retailer. The 20-year deal would bring traffic to Enron's fledgling fiber-optic
telecommunications network. And the venture reaffirmed the notion that Enron,
already America's pre-eminent energy trader, would soon be a lucrative
middleman for a vast range of other products, as well. 
  But within eight months of its launch, the partners had split. Enron blamed
Blockbuster for not getting the biggest movie studios to sign licensing deals
that would have guaranteed the hottest titles. Blockbuster said the criticism
was unfair. The video-rental company had expected to build the business
cooperatively over two decades. Enron's impatience "didn't add up," says
Blockbuster spokeswoman Karen Raskopf. 
  As it turns out, Blockbuster didn't know the half of it. Within months of
inking the deal, Enron had set up an affiliated partnership, code-named Project
Braveheart, an apparent allusion to the 1995 Mel Gibson movie. Enron obtained a
$115.2 million investment in the partnership from CIBC World Markets, the
investment-banking arm of Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in Toronto. In
return, CIBC received a promise of almost all earnings from Enron's share of
the venture for the first 10 years. Blockbuster didn't know about Braveheart at
the time, Ms. Raskopf says. 
  The partnership had no separate staff and no assets other than Enron's stake
in the venture with Blockbuster, which was barely getting off the ground in
late 2000. Still, in an audacious accounting move, Enron claimed $110.9 million
in profits from Braveheart in the fourth quarter of 2000 and the first quarter
of 2001. That amount sharply limited the overall losses suffered by Enron's
young fiber-optics division in the two periods. 
  At its peak, in March 2001, the venture with Blockbuster provided only about
1,000 test customers with movies in four U.S. cities. Many of those customers
didn't even pay. "It was nothing but a pilot project," says Blockbuster's Ms.
Raskopf. "I don't know how anyone could have been booking revenues."
Blockbuster, a unit of Viacom Inc., never accounted for any financial gain or
loss from the short-lived venture, she says. 
  Project Braveheart was one of dozens of outside partnerships that Enron
officials created to burnish the company's financial results at a time when it
felt under pressure to show high profits that would justify its soaring stock
price, according to current and former company executives. One of the reasons
Enron began sliding toward bankruptcy court last fall was the abandonment of
some of these accounting maneuvers, which contributed to huge losses and the
collapse of its stock. 
  Some of the partnerships were designed to shift large debts off Enron's
balance sheet and make the company appear more robust in the eyes of investors
and credit-rating agencies. Others, such as Braveheart, raised fast cash needed
to fund Enron's ever-expanding array of new businesses. The company had a grand
vision -- to move away from its roots in the energy business and build
futuristic electronic markets in everything from newsprint to bandwidth. But
the vision wasn't panning out financially, according to the current and former
executives and internal company documents. 
  Enron's current chief financial officer, Jeffrey McMahon, says he had nothing
to do with Braveheart or related partnerships. "I'm not going to defend them,"
he says. An Enron spokeswoman says the company has no other comment. 
  Whether Braveheart or any of the other partnerships involved deception that
could constitute civil or criminal fraud is a question that federal
investigators are only beginning to explore in their probes of Enron and its
auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP. Irving Einhorn, former head of the Securities and
Exchange Commission's Los Angeles office, says a company or individual can be
held liable in a civil lawsuit for failing to "disclose all material facts"
that might influence a "reasonable investor to invest or not invest." To prove
criminal fraud, a prosecutor must show "beyond a reasonable doubt" that a
defendant intended to mislead, Mr. Einhorn says. "You look for a guilty state
of mind." 
  Andersen's possible role in signing off on the structure of some or all of
the partnerships came into the spotlight Tuesday. The Big Five accounting firm
announced it had fired a partner in its Houston office who oversaw the Enron
account because he allegedly ordered the destruction of related e-mails and
documents. The Braveheart partnership was vetted and approved by Enron's
internal risk department and by Andersen, Mr. McMahon says. 
  As Enron's ambitions grew more diverse in the late 1990s, getting into
telecommunications struck some executives as appealing. In 1998, the company
launched a new unit with the idea of obtaining fiber-optic lines over which it
could deliver business data and entertainment. The unit, headed by Kenneth
Rice, a right-hand man of Enron's then-chief executive, Jeffrey Skilling, also
pioneered the trading of access to fiber-optic, or "broadband," networks it and
others would control. 
  Enron in 1998 acquired Portland General Electric, an Oregon utility that had
a budding fiber-optic network for phone and data traffic in the Pacific
Northwest. Enron expanded the network aggressively, hoping that businesses
would use it during weekdays to send information, while on nights and weekends,
consumers could receive movies on demand. 
  The Blockbuster venture announced in July 2000 was supposed to provide the
movies, which customers could control with a TV set-top box. Viewers would
select from a catalogue expected eventually to contain thousands of titles and
watch them whenever they wanted to for about the price of a rental. 
  With the Blockbuster venture under way, Enron incorporated its Braveheart
venture in Delaware on Dec. 28, 2000, giving it the legal name EBS Content
Systems LLC, according to Delaware public records. Internal Enron documents
describing Braveheart show a complicated financial structure in which there
were three classes of stock but EBS exercised effective control. Enron assigned
the partnership a value of $124.8 million based on its projections of the
revenue and earnings potential of the Blockbuster venture, according to the
company documents.

Blockbuster Deal -2: Partnership Ill-Structured
2002-01-16 23:09 (New York)

  From The Wall Street Journal 

  These documents indicate that Enron sought to structure the partnership so
that 3% of it was owned by outside investors. That is the minimum amount
required for such a partnership to be considered a legitimate "arms-length"
entity, separate from the company or person creating it, according to the
Financial Accounting Standards Board, the accounting industry's private
rule-setting organization. Achieving this status would allow Enron to treat
Braveheart's finances separately, rather than as part of Enron's own balance
sheet, and shield the partnership from public scrutiny. 
  To begin to piece together the 3% outside interest, Enron went to nCUBE, a
technology company controlled by Oracle's Mr. Ellison. The Portland, Ore.,
company, which as a contractor was supplying the Blockbuster venture with
computer hardware, also made a $2 million investment in Braveheart in late
2000, says Michael Pohl, nCube's president. Mr. Pohl says Enron promised to
return the $2 million in early 2001. "It was never a long-term thing," he adds.

  Enron still needed another $1.74 million to hit the 3% goal. It obtained the
money from another partnership, known as SE Thunderbird LLC, according to the
company documents. Defining this as outside money was complicated, since Enron
itself owned 71.5% of SE Thunderbird, while outsiders owned 28.5%. (SE
Thunderbird's ostensible purpose couldn't be determined.) 
  Here is how Enron got to 3%, according to the documents: The company took
$7.1 million from SE Thunderbird and moved it to Braveheart. Enron classified
28.5% of that -- or about $2 million -- as outside money. That meant that the
3% threshold had been exceeded. 
  Andersen signed off on the structure of the deal and the $124.8 million
valuation of the Braveheart partnership assigned by Enron, according to the
company documents. Andersen spokesman David Tabolt says the accounting firm
can't talk about the Braveheart venture "due to client-confidentiality issues."

  In exchange for its $115.2 million investment, CIBC was supposed to receive
93% of Braveheart's cash flow for 10 years. But Enron made the investment in
the embryonic partnership more attractive by promising to repay CIBC the full
value of its investment if the partnership failed to be a money maker. 
  Three former Enron employees familiar with the partnership deals say that
this kind of guarantee was designed specifically to attract investors who
otherwise might worry about the viability of the deals. "The banks didn't care
about the assets they invested in, and that's how it got out of control," says
one former Enron employee who helped create some of the partnerships. 
  In late November, CIBC said its total unsecured potential losses related to
Enron amounted to $115 million. That amount is roughly equal to the sum CIBC
invested in Braveheart. The bank also said it has secured-debt exposure to
Enron of another $100 million. Citing "client confidentiality," Rob McLeod, a
CIBC spokesman, declined yesterday to comment on its investment in Braveheart
or other Enron partnerships. 
  Mr. Pohl, the nCube president, says his company is "still on the hook for
that $2 million" it invested in Braveheart and is considering filing a claim
with the U.S. bankruptcy court in New York. 
  Raising money, such as the CIBC investment, through its partnerships was
essential to Enron. Andrew Fastow, then chief financial officer, discussed the
issue in general before the finance committee of the company's board of
directors in October 2000. Mr. Fastow was involved in putting many of the
partnerships in motion, although he apparently didn't play a direct role in
Braveheart, according to Mr. McMahon. Mr. Fastow told the board members that
the company needed a "private-equity strategy" that would fund "significant
capital investments by the company, some of which would not generate cash flow
or earnings for a number of years," according to excerpts of minutes of the
meeting. The capital investments included Enron's plans to expand trading of
such things as broadband access. 
  A lawyer for Mr. Fastow didn't return a phone call seeking comment. 
  Enron began using Braveheart for accounting purposes in the fourth quarter of
2000. For that period, Enron claimed its ownership of Braveheart resulted in a
$53 million profit, even though the Blockbuster venture was only two weeks into
its pilot program and not generating any profit at all. 
  One of the former Enron employees familiar with Braveheart recalls wondering
at the time, " `How can they monetize this asset when we're still putting it
together?' It didn't make any sense to me." 
  In the following quarter, the first of 2001, Enron claimed an additional
$57.9 million gain from Braveheart. "I was just floored," says the former
employee. "I mean, I couldn't believe it." At the time, the Blockbuster venture
was just starting in New York, Seattle, Portland, Ore., and Salt Lake City, the
former employees say. 
  The profits Enron claimed in its public financial disclosures contributed to
the impression that its broadband unit was promising, although still losing
money overall, and that the parent company's earnings were growing in line with
Enron's rising stock price. As a result of Braveheart's contribution, Enron
Broadband's losses were limited to a total of $67 million during the two
quarters. 
  At a stock analysts' meeting in Houston in January 2001, Enron presented
printed material in which it said it had achieved "critical mass roll-out of
broadband services strategy" in 2000. The material added that Enron's "premium
content-delivery business [was] firmly established." Enron told the analysts
that the broadband-content business eventually would generate $45 billion in
revenue, although it wasn't stated over what time period that would occur. 
  Analysts around this time continued recommending Enron stock as a "strong
buy." The stock was trading at close to its all-time peak of $90. 
  Mr. McMahon, who replaced Mr. Fastow as Enron's chief financial officer in
October, now says that timing and atmosphere were critical to obtaining the
CIBC investment in Braveheart. In late 2000, "the whole thought was that the
market was hot for broadband services," he says. 
  But by March 2001, the marriage between Blockbuster and Enron was on the
rocks. Both sides pointed fingers about what went wrong. After terminating the
pilot program, the two companies vowed to press ahead on their own in
delivering video on demand. 
  Termination of the Blockbuster deal, though, created accounting problems for
Enron. Braveheart had lost its source of potential revenue. 
  Pressed by analysts and investors to explain its many opaque partnership
deals, Enron in October announced a stunning third-quarter loss of $618
million. Lumped into that amount were losses from Braveheart -- basically a
reversal of the $110.9 million in profits it had claimed earlier -- as well as
losses related to soured investments in water-utilities and retail-energy
businesses. 
  Within weeks, there were more disastrous financial announcements, word that
the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating and a growing sense
that the once-mighty company was headed for insolvency.

Pricewaterhouse, KPMG Have A Link To Enron
2002-01-16 22:25 (New York)

  By Henny Sender and Susanne Craig 
  Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal 

  Accounting giants PricewaterhouseCoopers LP and KPMG LLP became the third and
fourth Big Five accounting firms to have a role in the Enron Corp. meltdown,
though they so far appear to have had only bit parts. 
  Pricewaterhouse provided advice to the energy-trading firm in connection with
two now-controversial partnerships with which Enron did business, people
familiar with the matter say. Specifically, Pricewaterhouse's role was to
provide an opinion to Enron about the fairness of the proceeds that Enron
received when it transferred assets to the two partnerships. KPMG provided the
independent auditor's report on the two partnerships, according to a spokesman.

  Various partnerships figure prominently in Enron's spiral into bankruptcy
court. While these partnerships were marketed as investment opportunities to a
small group of investors, in fact they came to serve as a sort of
off-balance-sheet dumping ground for bad assets and securities, critics now
contend. 
  Pricewaterhouse's valuation advice concerned assets transferred to LJM Cayman
LP and LJM2 Co-Investment LP, two partnerships set up by Andrew S. Fastow,
Enron's former chief financial officer, at the time he worked for the company. 
  References to Pricewaterhouse appear in internal Enron documents dated June
28, 1999. At that time, the Enron board discussed the transfer of an investment
worth $50 million to the first LJM partnership. It is standard practice for
accounting firms to make such appraisals on asset transfers, according to
Jeffrey Cohen, who heads the securities-law practice for Coudert Brothers in
New York, speaking generally. A spokesman for Pricewaterhouse says the firm
isn't currently an auditor, and never has been, of either partnership and has
never participated in, or given accounting advice to, Enron on its consolidated
statements. 
  Pricewaterhouse's link to Enron appears less controversial than that of rival
Arthur Andersen LLP, Enron's auditor. The links between Arthur Andersen and
Enron are now the subject of multiple government investigations. In 2000, Enron
paid Arthur Andersen $27 million for nonaudit work and $25 million in audit
fees. 
  The other Big Five firm to be touched by the Enron scandal is Deloitte &
Touche LLP, which in a Dec. 21 report gave Andersen a clean bill of health as
part of a "peer review." Though Deloitte noted what it described as a few minor
shortcomings, it found no cause for any action against Andersen and said
Andersen's system of accounting and audit quality control provided "reasonable
assurance of compliance with professional standards." Deloitte says its review
is in accordance with all prevailing standards. 
  Separately, three Canadian institutional investors that invested more than
$175 million in Enron debt securities in October filed a wrongful-conduct
lawsuit against the company's investment bankers and auditor. The suit, filed
yesterday in federal court in Manhattan, names Citigroup's Salomon Smith Barney
unit, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Bank of America Corp.'s Banc of America
Securities LLC and accounting firm Arthur Andersen. The plantiffs are
investment managers based in Toronto: Silvercreek Management Inc. and two of
its funds, Onex Industrial Partners Ltd. and Pebble Limited Partnership. Bank
of America, Goldman and Andersen couldn't be reached for comment. Salomon Smith
Barney declined to comment. 
  Calls to Enron weren't returned. Enron officials initially said they set up
the partnerships to minimize financial risk; in November, they conceded that
some of the partnership transactions were improperly accounted for.


McKinsey Held Close Enron Ties For Many Years
2002-01-16 23:00 (New York)

  By Suein Hwang and Rachel Emma Silverman 
  Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal 

  Back in the heady days of October 2000, at a sumptuous hotel ballroom in Palm
Beach, the finance committee of Enron Corp.'s board heard then-Chief Financial
Officer Andrew Fastow describe Enron's need for outside private partnerships to
help drive the company's explosive growth -- partnerships that would sow the
seeds of Enron's current woes. 
  According to internal company documents, one outsider also attended that
meeting: Richard N. Foster, a senior partner with McKinsey & Co. 
  Mr. Foster was an advisor to Enron's board between October 2000 and October
2001 and attended about six board meetings, according to a McKinsey spokesman.
Indeed, the celebrated consulting firm was a major force at Enron almost from
the company's birth in the mid-'80s. McKinsey was where former Enron CEO Jeff
Skilling worked before jumping to Enron, and McKinsey was instrumental in
advising Enron during its decade-long transformation from a
natural-gas-pipeline company into a massively complex trading operation with
far-flung interests in water, timber, and high-speed Internet. McKinsey
typically stationed its own personnel at Enron's offices, and dispatched about
five to 15 consultants to the Houston headquarters to advise on strategy and
operations, according to former Enron executives. 
  At a time when Enron's collapse is churning up thorny ethical and legal
problems for its accountants, lawyers and executives, the question arises: How
accountable should McKinsey, its strategy advisor, be? Though courts generally
haven't found consultants liable for their advice, McKinsey's long and close
relationship to Enron inevitably raises questions about how much the company
knew about financial irregularities that only surfaced last summer. 
  A McKinsey spokesman said: "In serving Enron, McKinsey was not retained to
provide advice to Enron or any Enron-affiliated entity with respect to the
company's financial reporting strategy, methods of financing, methods of
disclosure, investment partnerships or off-balance-sheet financing vehicles." 
  In exchange for its strategic advice to Enron, McKinsey received millions of
dollars in consulting fees. When Enron's stock began to soar, the consulting
firm made the Enron success story a cornerstone of the management gospel it
preaches in part to woo other clients. 
  In an article published in the March 22, 1997, edition of its academic
publication, McKinsey Quarterly, the authors celebrated Enron's "new breed of
tightly focused and vertically specialized `petropreneurs.'" Later in that same
article, Mc-Kinsey writers extolled how Enron had created a trading, finance
and risk management business worth more than $250 million in five years, and
how "its deployment of off-balance-sheet funds using institutional investment
money fostered its securitization skills and granted it access to capital at
below the hurdle rates of major oil companies." 
  Though such writings suggest McKinsey knew about Enron's extensive use of
off-balance sheet funds, there is no indication that anyone at the consulting
firm knew fully how Enron was using those partnerships. Late last year, Enron
had to restate four years of earnings because of improper accounting for some
of those entities. 
  A McKinsey spokesman said it was a 75-year old policy of the firm not to
comment specifically on client matters. 
  Enron also played a featured role in McKinsey-partner Mr. Foster's recent
book "Creative Destruction," published last year. "How do the concepts of
control, permission and risk fit together?" asked authors Mr. Foster and Sarah
Kaplan, a former McKinsey employee. "Enron offers one good example of managing
these elements to a favorable outcome." 
  Speaking on behalf of Mr Foster, a McKinsey spokesman said "the main thesis
of Creative Destruction is that in the long run markets outperform companies
because companies have not yet found a way to change at the pace and scale of
the markets without losing control." Enron didn't return calls seeking comment
about Mc-Kinsey's relationship with Enron. 
  McKinsey has seen rocky times of late. The slowing economy has impacted the
firm, forcing McKinsey to trim its work force last year. McKinsey was embroiled
in a public display of finger-pointing with a Chinese computer firm last year,
and the firm parted ways with Swissair after an ambitious plan it devised was
blamed for the airline's collapse. McKinsey declined to comment on those
relationships as well. 
  Enron could represent more than just an embarrassing client for McKinsey. Its
plunge into bankruptcy has sparked numerous investigations, as congressional
leaders and others search to understand what drove its collapse, which jolted
financial markets and left thousands of its current and former employees with
little or no retirement savings. McKinsey says it has not been contacted by
government investigators regarding Enron. 
  Though there is no indication that McKinsey may itself become a subject of
investigation, it could be caught up as a third party in the investigation of
its client. Legal experts say McKinsey, unlike Enron's lawyers and accountants,
has no privilege of confidentiality that would shield it from disclosing
information to government investigators. 
  For decades, McKinsey has been revered -- even feared -- for its influence in
boardrooms and its extensive and powerful old-boy network among major
corporations. Its alumni list reads like a who's who of the Fortune 500,
including the likes of IBM Corp. Chief Executive Lou Gerstner. In recent years,
that network has helped privately held McKinsey win lucrative consulting
contracts from companies run by its former partners. 
  Mr. Skilling, a vital bridge between McKinsey and Enron, described McKinsey's
approach in an interview with this newspaper in 1993, three years after joining
Enron: "In the old days, we'd do one project and go away," he said of his days
at McKinsey. But over time, "the relationships got closer and bigger." 
  McKinsey was central to Enron's "asset-light" strategy, the notion of
building an industrial powerhouse with few hard assets; McKinsey also advised
Enron as it considered entering new businesses, according to former Enron
executives. In one McKinsey Quarterly article in 1999, the consultants praised
Enron's water-industry investment, "despite a lack of obvious linkages to
energy," they wrote, "as a chance to leverage intangibles such as project
management, network operations, and infrastructure development skills." The
water foray ended in disaster last October, when Enron took a $287 million
write-off to exit the business. 
  One former executive who developed and managed power projects said he was
ordered to check with McKinsey when he wanted to make an arcane type of
gas-transmission investment. A team of McKinsey experts was sent to Enron's
offices to check out the deal. "They were all over the place," he says. 
  Suggestions that McKinsey was a "decision maker or a necessary review body on
Enron's asset investments are flat-out wrong," McKinsey says.


Enron Board's Actions Raise Liability Questions
2002-01-16 23:00 (New York)

  By Joann S. Lublin and John R. Emshwiller 
  Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal 

  It is a queasy time to be an Enron Corp. director. 
  This week's disclosure that the board of the collapsed Houston energy company
twice waived the corporate ethics code to allow creation of controversial
partnerships raises significant red flags about directors' potential liability.
According to a report that Houston law firm Vinson & Elkins prepared for Enron,
the full board twice suspended the company's ethics code during 1999 in order
to allow two outside partnerships to be headed by a top Enron executive who
stood to financially benefit from them. 
  The subsequent widespread disclosure of those partnerships last fall fueled
Enron's downward spiral toward a bankruptcy-court filing. 
  The law-firm report could increase Enron directors' legal exposure and
represents another example of "a culture of sloppiness on conflict-of-interest
issues," says Nell Minow, a veteran shareholder activist and editor of the
Corporate Library, an online database of corporate-governance information.
Enron board members seem to have "a real sense of unreality about conflicts of
interest," she adds. 
  An Enron spokeswoman didn't have any comment yesterday. In the past, the
company has defended its actions regarding the partnerships. Also, individual
Enron directors didn't return phone calls or couldn't be reached to comment. 
  Things could soon get even messier for its 15-member board. Several insurance
carriers that underwrite liability coverage for Enron directors and officers
are exploring ways they might suspend their policies, says an individual close
to the situation. One possibility: declare that Enron misled insurers by
renewing D&O policies based on earnings that it subsequently restated. In
November, weeks before its bankruptcy-court filing, Enron reduced its
previously reported net income dating back to 1997 by $586 million, or 20%,
mostly due to improperly accounting for its dealings with partnerships run by
some company officers. 
  It is increasingly common for insurance companies to seek rescission of D&O
policies "based on fraudulent applications" for new or renewed coverage, says
Stephen Weiss, a partner with Holland & Knight, a Washington law firm and an
expert on D&O insurance. "A restatement in earnings can certainly raise the
specter of insurers seeking to rescind their policies on the basis of apparent
fraud." 
  A spokesman for Minnesota-based St. Paul Cos., one of Enron's providers of
D&O insurance, declined to comment on whether it will maintain coverage. 
  Canceling such coverage following earnings restatements doesn't always get
insurers off the hook, however. Consider Sunbeam Corp. 
  A unit of New York-based American International Group Inc. dropped liability
insurance for Sunbeam directors and officers shortly after the Boca Raton,
Fla., consumer-products concern restated financial results for the six quarters
ended March 31, 1998. The restatement covered essentially the entire tenure of
Albert J. Dunlap, who was ousted as chairman and chief executive in mid-1998
amid massive accounting irregularities. 
  Sunbeam subsequently sued the AIG unit in federal district court in Miami,
seeking restoration of its halted coverage. Under a settlement reached early
last year, the AIG unit agreed to pay Sunbeam $10 million -- but refused to
reinstate the canceled policy, informed individuals say. 
  The extent of Enron directors' potential liability for waiving the ethics
code may depend on whether a court decides this was intentional misconduct.
"Any time [directors] abrogate a company's code of conduct, you raise serious
questions," said Charles Elson, a board member at three publicly traded
concerns who runs the University of Delaware business school's Center for
Corporate Governance. "Are their actions reckless or negligent?" 
  On the other hand, Mr. Weiss noted that corporate codes of ethics sometimes
permit waivers under appropriate circumstances. You can't automatically assume
that suspending an ethics code is wrong, he added. 
  At Enron, the first waiver was in June 1999, when finance chief Andrew Fastow
was looking to set up a private partnership to be known as LJM Cayman LP.
Because the partnership would do business with Enron, Mr. Fastow needed a
special ruling from the board that his activities wouldn't violate company
rules on outside business interests. 
  According to an excerpt of the minutes of the company's June 28, 1999, board
meeting, there was a "discussion" of Mr. Fastow's involvement in the LJM
partnership. The minutes don't go into details about what was discussed.
However, the board adopted a resolution that ratified a recommendation from top
management that Mr. Fastow's partnership participation "will not adversely
affect the interests of the Company," according to the minutes. 
  Directors' approval of the partnership also included "waiver of Enron's code
of ethics to permit Mr. Fastow to act as the general partner" of the
partnership, the Vinson report stated. 
  The waiver involved a suspension of corporate policies intended to protect
against executives being involved in activities that might pose a conflict of
interest or be detrimental to Enron. Later that year, Mr. Fastow was looking to
set up the larger and more ambitious LJM2 Co-Investment LP. (LJM Cayman had $16
million from outside investors; LJM2 had nearly $400 million.) 
  An excerpt from an Oct. 11, 1999, meeting of the finance committee of Enron's
board recounts Mr. Fastow telling the committee that Enron's "Conduct of
Business Affairs Policies" would "prohibit him from participating in LJM2 as
managing partner . . . absent appropriate reviews and waivers from the Board."
The excerpt shows that the finance panel voted to recommend such a waiver to
the full board. 
  The next day, Oct. 12, the full board approved that waiver for Mr. Fastow on
LJM2. The resolution used essentially the same language as in the case of LJM
Cayman. 
  Enron estimates that Mr. Fastow eventually made over $30 million from the two
partnerships. 
  Enron has between $250 million and $350 million in current D&O coverage, says
a person close to the situation. But even if the firm retains all its insurance
for directors and officers, no one knows if that will be enough to cope with
the pending litigation. The full board is named in nearly all of the 50 pending
shareholder derivative suits. 

New memo uncovered in Enron probe
January 17, 2002 Posted: 1:44 a.m. EST (0644 GMT)

WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The House Energy and Commerce Committee uncovered another memo Wednesday from Enron whistleblower Sherron Watkins detailing her concerns about the company's problems -- this one describing a phone call in which she shared her worries with a partner at Arthur Andersen. 

The latest memo -- dated August 20 -- indicated she called a senior official at Andersen, who was also a friend of hers, and talked about her concerns. 
Watkins later wrote a seven-page memo to Enron Chairman and CEO Kenneth Lay that said she was worried that "... we will implode in a wave of accounting scandals." 
Andersen, the energy giant's accounting firm, is also under scrutiny in probes on the fall of Enron, which declared bankruptcy in December. 
After speaking to Watkins, the senior official convened a meeting with three Andersen partners, including David Duncan, the Anderson partner overseeing the Enron audit, a source told CNN. Duncan has since been fired. 
The accounting firm said Duncan, a former lead partner in the firm's Houston office, instructed others to destroy Enron documents, but a spokesman for Duncan said he acted on the advice of an in-house Andersen lawyer. 
Duncan was quizzed Wednesday by eight investigators for the House Energy and Commerce Committee -- one of several committees and subcommittees probing the collapse of Enron. The meeting was not public. 
The Enron scandal began when the energy company, with $62.8 billion in assets, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection December 2. Many Enron employees had invested most of their 401(k) savings in company stock and lost much of their life savings when it went bust. 
Latest developments
* The White House refused to say whether it was conducting a formal review to determine if Enron officials contacted more government officials. Press secretary Ari Fleischer, in a somewhat contentious exchange with reporters, said the administration planned to look into contacts between Bush administration officials and Enron executives only if there are any allegations of wrongdoing or in response to specific questions. 
* The FBI sent out an internal bulletin seeking 38 agents who are also certified public accountants to relocate to Houston to staff the Enron task force, officials told CNN Wednesday. 
* According to a report by Rep. Henry Waxman, D-California, who has been critical of the White House for not releasing records related to the closed-door meetings of Vice President Dick Cheney's energy task force, "there are at least 17 policies in the White House energy plan that were advocated by Enron or that benefited Enron." A spokeswoman for Cheney dismissed the Waxman report as "election-year maneuvering."  
* Sen. Patrick Leahy, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, warned the Justice Department Wednesday it might have a conflict of interest with Arthur Andersen. In a letter to Deputy Attorney General Lawrence Thompson, Leahy, D-Vermont, noted that the accounting firm has a contract worth more than $700,000 with the Justice Department to complete a review of the FBI as it undergoes a reorganization. 
* A former federal regulator said Enron tried to manipulate U.S. energy policy. Curtis Hebert Jr., a former commissioner with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in the Clinton administration, said in an interview with CNN: "Everything they espoused to Congress and to state leaders was always what's in the best interests of Enron, never what's in the best interests of American energy companies."(


Enron Auditor Questioned by House Investigators (Update)
2002-01-16 21:05 (New York)

     (Adds Enron executive's call to Andersen in August in second
and 10th through 15th paragraphs.)

     Washington, Jan. 16 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. House investigators
interviewed David Duncan, the Arthur Andersen LLP partner who
oversaw Enron Corp.'s audit, about his role in destroying
thousands of e-mails and documents related to the collapse of the
largest energy trader.
     Duncan answered questions from investigators of the Energy
and Commerce Committee for 4 1/2 hours, a day after Andersen said
it fired him for ordering the document destruction in October
after the Securities and Exchange Commission asked for information
about Enron's books. A committee member also said an Enron
executive raised concerns with Andersen about accounting
irregularities in August.
     ``It was an informal interview,'' Ken Johnson, a committee
spokesman, said of the meeting with Duncan. ``He was not sworn-in,
but was warned about giving false testimony. He fully
cooperated.''
     The committee, six other Congressional panels and the Justice
Department are investigating the unraveling of Enron, which filed
the largest bankruptcy in history last month. Hearings, which
begin next Tuesday, will focus on the partnerships the Houston-
based company created to hide debt, Andersen's conduct and the
secrecy of energy trading.
    The loss of documents from Andersen may go beyond negligent or
unethical behavior, particularly in light of a Securities and
Exchange Commission probe, Johnson said earlier in the day.
     ``It might have been illegal,'' he said.

                         Bound for Houston

     Duncan provided investigators with some leads to pursue,
Johnson said, refusing to give details. Tomorrow and Friday
investigators from Congress will be in Houston to interview more
people, he said.
     Democrats said Duncan's statements did not answer all the
questions they had about Enron's accounting and transactions.
     ``Our investigators were disappointed by the limited nature
of Mr. Duncan's memory,'' said Laura Sheehan, a spokesman for
Representative John Dingell, senior Democrat on the panel. ``We
expect documents and other witnesses to fill in the blanks.''
     Andersen had indications there were questions being raised
about how some of Enron's partnerships were being accounted for
before the SEC requested information in October, Representative
James Greenwood, a member of the house panel, said. The questions
came from within Enron.

                             A Warning

     Enron Vice President Sherron Watkins warned Enron Chairman
Kenneth Lay on Aug. 16 of looming ``accounting scandals,''
according to a copy of the memo she wrote that was released by the
committee. Greenwood, a Pennsylvania Republican, said that Watkins
followed up that warning with a telephone call to an Andersen
audit partner on Aug. 20.
     Details about the call were given in an internal Andersen
memorandum, Greenwood said.
     ``This document raises additional concerns about Andersen's
knowledge of potential accounting irregularities and the
subsequent destruction of Enron-related documents,'' Greenwood
said in a statement.
     Patrick Dorton, a spokesman for Andersen, said the company
contacted Enron's general counsel after Watkins' call and was told
that Enron had begun investigating.
     ``What additional steps were taken, we're still looking at,''
Dorton said. ``We're still trying to learn all the facts.''

                      Pressing for Punishment

     Andersen's firing of Duncan and its decision to place three
other partners on administrative leave yesterday may not satisfy
government officials, some of whom are pressing for prosecution of
employees and changes in accounting procedures.
     ``If rules were broken, rule breakers should be punished,''
Peter Fisher, the Treasury Department's undersecretary for
domestic finance, said during a speech today to insurance
executives in Boca Raton, Florida. ``If rules were bent, we should
improve the means of enforcing those rules.''
     Enron executives in October and early November asked Fisher
to contact banks on behalf of the company, a request he rejected.
     Bush administration officials also are attracting scrutiny
because of their own ties to Enron and Andersen.
     SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt said he's not managing his agency's
investigation of Enron or Andersen and that he may disqualify
himself from any involvement. Pitt represented Andersen in his
private law practice.
     Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy, chairman of the Judiciary
Committee, wrote in a letter to the Justice Department that he was
concerned that Andersen may have access to confidential
information from the FBI. Andersen has a $700,000 contract to
study and advise the FBI on some internal operations, including
its computer system.
     Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson, who is leading the
Justice Department investigation, said the consulting unit hired
by the FBI is ``different and separate'' from Andersen's
accounting unit.

                           Stock Trading

     Democrats also are calling for more information on whether
administration officials got any inside information from Enron
before selling the stock.
     ``If Hillary Clinton had sold millions of dollars of stock
like the secretary of the Army did, some of my colleagues on the
other side would be raising questions,'' said Representative Peter
Deutsch, senior Democrat on a House subcommittee probing Enron.
     Before joining the administration, Army Secretary Thomas
White was vice chairman of Enron Energy Services, an Enron
subsidiary.
     Representative Henry Waxman of California, senior Democrat on
the House Government Reform panel, again raised questions about
Enron's access to Vice President Dick Cheney's Energy Task Force.
The White House last week disclosed that Enron representatives met
with Cheney or his staff six times before completion of the
report.
     Waxman released a report saying at least 17 policies
recommended by Cheney's task force benefited Enron, including
support for trading energy derivatives and proposals to aid
natural gas projects.
     Waxman urged the White House to release to the non-partisan
General Accounting Office all records of industry contacts with
the energy task force.
     ``This creates the unfortunate appearance that a large
contributor received special access and obtained extraordinarily
favorable results in the White House energy plan,'' Waxman wrote
in a letter to Cheney today.
     Revelations about the document destruction also have drawn
the scrutiny of a California state Senate committee, which today
decided to subpoena Enron to determine if Andersen destroyed
documents that they were seeking last June. The panel decided not
to subpoena Andersen. The Senate subpoenaed documents in June as
part of a probe into whether power companies manipulated
California's energy market.


Arthur Andersen Knew Of Enron Woes A Year Ago
2002-01-17 00:00 (New York)

  By Tom Hamburger and Ken Brown 
  Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal 

  WASHINGTON -- Arthur Andersen LLP officials discussed Enron Corp.'s
aggressive accounting practices and potential conflicts of interest at a
February 2001 meeting called to decide whether to retain the energry-trading
company as a client, an internal memo from the accounting firm shows. 
  A second memo, cited by congressional investigators, shows that an Enron
executive who warned the company's chief executive that it was in danger of
being swamped by accounting irregularities also voiced concerns to Andersen in
August 2001. 
  The first memo -- drafted Feb. 6, 2001, by an Andersen auditor on the Enron
account named Michael Jones -- recounts a meeting the day before of Andersen
executives about whether the accounting firm should continue working for Enron.
Such a "retention meeting," as the memo calls it, isn't unusual in itself. But,
the memo recounts the executives discussing many of the alleged problems that
have become the focus of criminal, civil and congressional investigations into
Enron's collapse. Enron, of Houston, filed for bankruptcy-court protection
under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code on Dec. 2, the largest such filing
ever, and investigators increasingly are focusing on Andersen's role. 
  "Significant discussion was held regarding the related-party transactions
with LJM, including the materiality of such amounts to Enron's income statement
and the amount retained `off balance sheet,' " the memo says, referring to a
private partnership that kept Enron debt off the company's books. The memo
specifically mentions "conflicts of interest" by then-Enron Chief Financial
Officer Andrew Fastow, who controlled that partnership and others like it, and
the fact that he received compensation from it. 
  Such partnership arrangements contributed greatly to Enron's collapse.
Widespread publicity of them last fall caused a crisis of investor confidence
in the company that helped drive down the company's stock. Written eight months
before Enron's downward spiral began, the memo raises nearly every accounting
issue that led to the energy-trading company's downfall, including its need to
maintain a high credit rating. Decisions by rating agencies to downgrade
Enron's rating were followed soon after by the company's bankruptcy filing. 
  The memo describes discussions of how the partnership transactions were
described in footnotes in Enron financial statements and mentions efforts to
make sure Andersen auditors "fully understand the economics and substance of
the transactions." Another "significant discussion" was held about how Enron
valued its earnings on such transactions and "the fact that it was `intelligent
gambling.' " The memo notes that Enron was "aggressive in its transaction
structuring. 
  "Ultimately, the conclusion was reached to retain Enron as a client [because]
it appeared that we had the appropriate people and processes in place to serve
Enron and manage our engagement risks," the memo says. 
  During the discussion, the Andersen executives noted Enron's fees to the firm
eventually could total $100 million a year -- an amount that would have made
Enron the accounting firm's biggest client by far. The executives discussed
whether their decision to retain Enron was colored by the size of the fees, and
the memo suggests they were concerned about whether too much of Andersen's
Enron income was coming from nonaudit advisory work. "Such amounts did not
trouble the participants as long as the nature of the services was not an
issue," the memo says. 
  David Tabolt, an Andersen spokesman, said he was unaware of the memo and the
meeting it recounts. "I am unable to provide any comment until I look into
this," he said. Accounting firms regularly review clients to determine if
auditing the books puts the accounting firm at risk. The Andersen memo doesn't
specify if this was one of those regular meetings or if it was called for a
particular reason. Mr. Tabolt stressed that Andersen doesn't hesitate to drop
risky clients for various reasons. "We've dumped thousands of clients in recent
years," he said. 
  The memo was addressed to two Andersen officials, including David Duncan, who
headed the Enron account and who Andersen this week said it fired for
overseeing the destruction of Enron-related documents after learning that
federal regulators were examining the energy-trading company's finances. 
  Mr. Duncan was quizzed at length yesterday by investigators for the House
Energy and Commerce Committee and the Justice Department in separate,
closed-door sessions. Much of the congressional questions related to the
February 2001 memo. Mr. Duncan told the investigators he called the meeting
because he was aware the Enron account posed "significant risk," according to
one person present during the questioning. The memo provided a "To Do" list
that included recommending that Enron's board review the fairness of
transactions with the LJM partnership. Asked whether he followed up on that and
other items on the list, Mr. Duncan answered "no" to most, often suggesting it
was the responsibility of others at the accounting firm. 
  The second memo, by another Andersen executive, recounts an Aug. 20, 2001,
phone conversation with Enron Vice President Sherron Watkins, a former Andersen
employee who that same month alerted Enron Chief Executive Kenneth Lay to
possible conflicts of interest and potential accounting irregularities that she
feared could bring the company down. 
  Congressional aides who have read the memo said it shows that Ms. Watkins
detailed her concerns about Enron to an Andersen auditor. The three-page memo
indicates Ms. Watkins's concerns were relayed to senior Andersen management,
including Mr. Duncan. 
  Ken Johnson, spokesman for committee Chairman Billy Tauzin (R., La.), said
the memo was apparently written after a meeting of Andersen executives to
discuss Ms. Watkins's warnings. The internal memo includes a summary of Ms.
Watkins's allegations and concludes by noting that the officials from Andersen
"agreed to consult with our firm's legal adviser about what actions to take." 
  "This document raises additional concerns about Andersen's knowledge of
potential accounting irregularities and the subsequent destruction of
Enron-related documents," said Rep. James Greenwood (R., Pa.), chairman of the
Energy and Commerce's oversight subcommittee. 
  Andersen's Mr. Tabolt acknowledged the accounting firm knew about Ms.
Watkins's issues with Enron's finances. "We were made aware of her concerns and
we confirmed that Enron's general counsel was aware and we were advised that
the CEO was being notified, and we were told that Vinson & Elkins [Enron's law
firm] was doing an investigation," Mr. Tabolt said. "We think that that was the
right thing to do." 
  Andersen had a major financial incentive to keep Enron, which paid $52
million in auditing and other fees to Andersen in 2000 alone. "There are a lot
of $25 million clients, but $50 million clients, Enron might have been it," a
former Andersen partner said. 
  The Houston office was one of Andersen's biggest and most profitable, mainly
because it dominates the auditing of the oil-and-gas industry, handling by some
estimates 80% of its mid- and large-size companies. "Texas is a stronghold,"
the former partner said. Indeed, Andersen employs more than 1,400 people in
Houston and boasts that it is the biggest of the Big Five accounting firms in
the city, even though it is the smallest of the Big Five overall.

Arthur Andersen Confronts Role In Enron Debacle
2002-01-16 20:48 (New York)

  By Vanessa O'Connell, Wall Street Journal

  ARTHUR ANDERSEN has a message for those who think the Enron scandal will
bring the accounting firm down: This saga isn't over yet. 
  In a full-page newspaper ad yesterday, Joseph Berardino, the firm's chief
executive, sought to assure the public that "Andersen will do what is right."
The declaration of intent, which appeared in The Wall Street Journal, the New
York Times and the Washington Post, was Andersen's first significant effort to
convince the public that it will survive the financial scandal now unfolding.
In crisis-management situations, newspaper ads from chief executives have
become a common first step. 
  Andersen's reputation suffered a major blow after the disclosure that its
employees shredded key documents related to Enron's shaky financial condition.
Andersen, Enron's auditing firm, now is a subject of a Securities and Exchange
Commission investigation. Until recently, the crisis has been handled almost
exclusively by Andersen's internal public-relations team, led by David Tabolt,
a former editor and reporter for the Associated Press. Mr. Tabolt, 51 years
old, joined Andersen in 1999 following stints at some public-relations firms. 
  But last week, Mr. Tabolt and the Andersen public-relations team were given
some outside help. At the suggestion of its outside lawyers and lobbyists,
Andersen hired the big guns at the Washington crisis-management team Chlopak,
Leonard, Schechter & Associates, a unit of Omnicom Group. 
  Formed in 1992 by three former political communications strategists, Chlopak,
Leonard specializes in managing a client's reputation around the globe. Its
clients include the American Red Cross, the organization stung by controversy
last fall when it disclosed that not all the funds collected after the attacks
would go to Sept. 11 causes. The Red Cross later said it would redirect the
money earmarked to help families of victims of the attacks. 
  Charlie Leonard, a partner at the firm, says his firm was part of a team that
suggested Andersen run the ad. "Advertising is one means of telling the
complete story of what Andersen is willing to do to," he says. Mr. Leonard, a
former strategist for the onetime presidential candidate Ross Perot, is the
firm's point person in its efforts to get the scandal under control. 
  The Enron episode marks the third major public-relations fiasco for Andersen
auditors in less than a year. In May, the firm agreed to pay Sunbeam
shareholders $110 million to settle a securities lawsuit. Shortly after that,
Andersen had to pay $20 million to holders of Waste Management after regulators
found accounting problems. 
  Mr. Berardino and his Chicago-based company face a combined legal and
public-relations horror that threatens to destroy the Andersen brand. "This is
catastrophic for them," says Alan Siegel, chief executive of Siegelgale, an
independent branding firm based in New York. "Not only is this going to hurt
Andersen very much in terms of contracting new business, but it also will be a
distraction for all Andersen employees." 
  If you haven't noticed the ad yet, keep looking. Andersen intends to expand
its public-image campaign in the coming weeks, as its chief executive seeks to
spread his message to consumers and businesses across the country. Newspapers
in Houston, Chicago, Los Angeles and Phoenix are expected to begin running the
ad today. 
  Robert Chlopak of Chlopak Leonard says, "One of the things we try to do is to
encourage our clients to communicate about their actions to show they are
taking responsibility and trying to act in a manner the business community and
public would expect them to," he says. "When an institution like the Red Cross
does that, they tend to fare much better than if they were simply to bunker
down and wait it out."


DJ Texas Lawmakers Want Probe Into Enron, Arthur Andersen
2002-01-16 22:01 (New York)

  AUSTIN (AP)--A Texas lawmaker on Wednesday asked the state's accounting board
to investigate whether Arthur Andersen LLP. violated state auditing standards
in its handling of Houston-based Enron Corp. 
  The request from state Rep. Steve Wolens, D-Dallas, also  asks the board to
investigate the auditing standards of Enron's accountants. 
  A subcommittee of the Texas State Board of Public Accountancy met Wednesday
but William Treacy, the board's executive director, said he couldn't say if the
committee will recommend that the board investigate. He said possible
investigations are confidential by statute. 
  Wolens, who chairs the House State Affairs Committee, said he asked for the
investigation because "the acts of destroying thousands of Enron documents
occurred in Texas and the Texas State Board of Public Accountancy has legal
jurisdiction to police accountants for fraud and dishonesty in the performance
of their professional services to Texas," Wolens said. 
  Arthur Andersen has said that a "signficant but undetermined" number of
documents relating to the failing Enron have been destroyed. 
  Enron Corp. declared bankrupty Dec. 2, after acknowledging that the company
overstated its profits by more than $580 million since 1997. 
  Calls to Arthur Andersen and Enron were not immediately returned. 
  Besides asking the board to investigate whether the companies violated
auditing standards, Wolens also asked the  board to investigate whether Arthur
Andersen or Enron illegally engaged in fraud or dishonesty in the performance
of their services. 
  Wolens also asked the board to investigate: 
  - Whether Arthur Andersen and/or Enron's accountants violated their internal
records' retention policy or the professional records' retention policy. 
  - Whether Enron's accountants subordinated their judgment to Enron's
management. 
  - Whether Arthur Andersen and Enron's accountants violated rules of
professional conduct. 
  In his letter, Wolens said he was disturbed by news reports that Arthur
Andersen destroyed documents related to its work for Enron. 
  The Justice Department is pursuing a criminal investigation of Enron. 
  Arthur Andersen said Tuesday it is firing a senior auditor who organized the
disposal of Enron documents last fall. 
  "It is important that your office pursue this matter,"  Wolens said in his
letter. "It is imperative as a matter of public policy to maintain the
integrity of Public Accountancy profession."


Column: Enron's Political Contacts Key To Scandal
2002-01-16 21:40 (New York)

  By Albert R. Hunt, Wall Street Journal

  At an American Enterprise Institute-sponsored seminar on energy last summer
in Vail, participants, including Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, White
House counselor Larry Lindsey and some prominent corporate CEOs, were
appropriately deferential to Vice President Cheney. 
  They all referred to him as "Mr. Vice President" with one exception: Kenneth
Lay. To the Enron executive, he was "Dick." 
  There no longer are Enron apologists. But there are plenty of Bush apologists
on this mushrooming scandal: Not bailing out the now-bankrupt company, they
assert, was a "tribute to American capitalism." Enron was a non-partisan
briber, they say, or this is a private industry scandal, not a political one.
Not quite. 
  Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill is right when he says the government
shouldn't have rescued this deceitful company, though arguably he might have
alerted the regulators sooner. But that in no way lessens the shame of a
scandal in which top corporate executives lie to the investing public and bail
out to the tune of more than a billion dollars of their own equity, while
thousands of lower-level employees see their life savings plummet. Government
is necessary to protect against such abuses. 
  If the press, Congress and prosecutors are vigilant, more exposes are
inevitable: Who was cut in on some of Enron's illicit partnerships, what other
governmental favors were given? Let's examine critical connections: 
  The Cheney Connection: Enron's generosity to this administration paid off in
the Bush/Cheney energy plan. The Vice President has largely kept mum on the
details of this connection and the press has been remarkably acquiescent. 
  The General Accounting Office wants to know the role played by vested
interests in the Cheney Task Force. The White House has refused: Only under
pressure recently did Mr. Cheney acknowledge that Ken Lay or Enron had met with
him and his task force on six separate occasions. 
  The principle here is no different than Hillary Clinton's refusal to reveal
the private deliberations involving special interests in assembling her 1993
health-care proposal. The political right justifiably criticized and brought
legal action against her. Mr. Cheney's stonewalling is likewise an attempt to
avoid embarrassing revelations. 
  Yesterday Democratic Rep. Henry Waxman released a report detailing sixteen
provisions of Mr. Cheney's energy recommendations that had been advocated by
Enron. Many, no doubt, would have been included without Enron's input. But when
the details of the secret deliberations emerge -- the only question is when --
it'll be instructive to see what role the Texas company had in proposals for
electricity restructuring, boosting energy production in India or the glowing
description of trading derivatives as "sophisticated and customizable." 
  The Bush Connection: Last Thursday, the President of the United States broke
a campaign pledge to restore integrity to the White House. Seeking to distance
himsef from Mr. Lay -- whom he'd affectionately called "Kenny Boy" and sent an
effusive birthday greeting a few years ago -- he declared the Enron CEO had
supported his opponent Ann Richards in his first gubernatorial run in 1994. 
  The company did give money to both political parties in that race. But as Mr.
Bush knows, Mr. and Mrs. Lay gave three times more to him, and Mr. Lay endorsed
him. 
  Indeed, over the last eight years, Enron has given over $700,000 dollars to
George W. Bush -- more than any other donor -- and more than it's given to
anyone else. Mr. Lay was one of the "Pioneers," raising more than $100,000 for
the Bush presidential quest. The company contributed to the Florida recount
fund and the Bush inaugural festivities as well. And Mr. Bush has been
appreciative. While governor, his regulators were Enron-friendly. He even
lobbied his friend, then-Pennsylvania governor Tom Ridge, on behalf of Enron. 
  These close ties continued in the Bush presidency. Curtis Hebert Jr., then
chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, said Mr. Lay told him he
could stay on as chairman if he changed his views on electricity deregulation.
He didn't, and not too long afterwards President Bush replaced him with an old
Enron ally from Texas. Sen. Joe Lieberman should put Messrs. Herbert and Lay
under oath about this conversation when he holds hearings next week. 
  The Contribution Connection: The greatest canard in the miserable saga is
that because the government didn't bail out Enron in October, it proves the
company's massive campaign contributions didn't work. Actually, some of this
sleazy scam might not have occurred if not for the special favors Enron got
from its connections and 6 million in contributions over the past 12 years --
to Democrats as well as Republicans. 
  Sen. Phil Gramm and his wife Wendy are the Enron "poster couple." She took
care of the company's interests as head of the Commodity Futures Training
Commission then was handsomely rewarded as a director and member of its
so-called audit committee. As a senator, he raked in big campaign bucks and
produced legislation like the Commodity Futures Modernization Act, which
deregulated financial derivatives and relaxed oversight of commodity exchanges.

  One of the worst perpetrators is Arthur Andersen, which not only was asleep
at the switch but shredded Enron documents. Andersen was Enron's auditor and
consultant to the company, a sweetheart deal arrangement that would never have
been if former Securities and Exchange Chairman Arthur Levitt had had his way. 
  Mr. Levitt, who says there are a "multitude of villains" -- rating agencies,
investment bankers, company and board officials as well as accountants -- sees
a clear conflict of interest: "When a firm is paid a million dollars a week,
half of which comes from consulting, when it comes down to making a subjective
judgement -- and there were probably hundreds of subjective judgements in an
Enron audit -- it's obvious who they're going to side with, management or
shareholders." 
  But when Mr. Levitt tried to end such conflicts, accounting firms, armed with
$24 million in campaign contributions the past two elections, persuaded
Congress to threaten the SEC budget and make him retreat. One lawmaker who
sided with the accountants was Sen. Lieberman. 
  Mr. Levitt is right, there are numerous private sector culprits; this should
lead to some serious reforms. But let's not let the politicians off the hook;
they're culpable too. 


Critics: SEC's Pitt Should Avoid Enron Probe
2002-01-16 23:00 (New York)

  By Wall Street Journal staff reporters Charles Gasparino and Susan Pulliam in
New York and Michael Schroeder in Washington 

  As Enron Corp. was imploding in December, Harvey Pitt, the new head of the
Securities and Exchange Commission, called a private meeting of the accounting
industry's top officials. The industry, already under pressure, was facing
questions about why Arthur Andersen LLP failed to detect financial woes at the
energy trader. 
  But Mr. Pitt didn't call for sweeping changes. Rather, people briefed on the
meeting say that the SEC chief -- after years as a private attorney
representing securities and accounting firms -- offered the accounting
officials some advice: Come up with a statement addressing growing concerns
about the industry's ability to audit large corporate clients. 
  What resulted surprised even some current and former SEC officials. The
statement from the Big Five and their trade group, the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants, blamed the accounting system, not the accountants
themselves, for failing to require corporate clients to disclose financial data
that could have prevented the Enron debacle. Mr. Pitt immediately posted the
guidelines, including the group's proposal to "encourage public companies to
take immediate steps to improve their disclosures" on the SEC's Web site. 
  The Big Five declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Mr. Pitt says his
meetings with the industry are "old news," adding that AICPA's petition was
posted on the Web site as a result of a new policy of Mr. Pitt's. "If it's a
rule-making the commission may act on, it's better to seek public comment
sooner rather than later," the spokeswoman said. 
  Today, Mr. Pitt will say that the SEC and accounting firms are creating a new
private-sector oversight board to monitor that industry. 
  Still, some investors' lawyers are critical. "As a private attorney, Mr. Pitt
earned millions of dollars representing big Wall Street and accounting firms,
including Arthur Andersen," says Jacob Zamansky, a New York-based lawyer
representing investors. "As SEC chairman he appears to be siding with the
industry rather than the public investors whom he is charged to protect." 
  In any event, Mr. Pitt's ties to the financial industry put him in an awkward
position amid a major investigation by his agency into what went wrong at
Enron, and what role Arthur Andersen played in any misrepresentations Enron
made to investors. The big question: How well can Mr. Pitt, who represented
Andersen, as well as all the nation's big accounting firms, oversee a massive
inquiry into the largest accounting scandal in the nation's history? 
  Some critics say he shouldn't even try. Some legislators are calling for his
recusal from the Enron investigation, and the SEC inquiry into whether Arthur
Anderson violated securities laws by failing to uncover the company's
deteriorating financial statements. An even bigger challenge is whether Mr.
Pitt will be able to oversee what is sure to become a broader examination by
the SEC into the accounting system. 
  "He ought to follow the [Attorney General John] Ashcroft model and recuse
himself," says Sen. Jon Corzine, former chief executive at Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. The Democrat from New Jersey adds, "There is a serious appearance issue
here based on his previous activities and representations in the legal
community." Yesterday, Common Cause, a good-government organization, made a
similar recusal request. 
  Mr. Pitt says he has no intention to step aside from the Enron matter. "Talk
about recusals misperceives how this agency operates," he said in a statement
this week. "It is not the function of the chairman of the SEC, or any
commissioner, to manage an investigation. If and when I am asked to do anything
on this matter, I will follow both the letter and the spirit of the ethical
requirements of this office. Any suggestion that I would do otherwise is an
attempt to politicize the workings of an independent agency." 
  Yesterday, a spokesman for Mr. Pitt said: "Apart from joining the unanimous
vote to authorize the SEC division of enforcement to commence an investigation,
Chairman Pitt has not participated in the Enron investigation." In an interview
yesterday, Mr. Pitt added: "I'm interested in making certain that Enron doesn't
happen again." 
  The administration backs Mr. Pitt. White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said
President Bush has "full faith and confidence that Mr. Pitt, as well as all
members of his administration, will do the right things." 
  Mr. Pitt isn't the first SEC chairman to face criticism over past ties to
industry, of course. His predecessor, Arthur Levitt, initially sparked concern
by some who said he was too close to the securities industry. But Mr. Levitt
proved often to be tough on securities and accounting firms. 
  Questions about Mr. Pitt's potential conflicts of interest with major
financial companies and accounting firms are nothing new. Mr. Pitt, a former
general counsel for the SEC, went into private practice in 1978, and since
then, his client list included some of the biggest participants in the
financial industry, including Ivan Boesky during the insider-trading scandal
and Merrill Lynch & Co., after the Orange County, Calif., bankruptcy in 1994.
Mr. Pitt also was a top lawyer for the accounting industry. These potential
conflicts, raised during his confirmation hearings, weren't enough to derail
his appointment. 
  For years, Mr. Pitt has been involved in defending the accounting industry
against limits on consulting services being offered to audit clients -- a main
issue in the controversy over possible auditor-independence violations dogging
Arthur Andersen in the Enron debacle. In 1990, Mr. Pitt helped win SEC
clearance for Arthur Andersen to continue cross-selling consulting services to
audit clients. The argument was based on the fact that Andersen Consulting had
been separated from the accounting side of the business, removing many of the
potential conflicts. (The SEC a few years later revoked its permission, because
Andersen Consulting began providing more services to Andersen audit clients
than anticipated.) 
  In a recent interview, Mr. Pitt said he wouldn't take part in decisions by
the SEC related to his former law-firm clients for a year. Meanwhile, SEC
officials say he hasn't pulled any punches so far in the Enron investigation,
at least the part that involves potential misdeeds at the energy company and
its executives. "Go get 'em," he told members of the enforcement staff when the
SEC launched its inquiry into Enron in October. 
  In the interview, Mr. Pitt says he has "focused on the real issues -- a
disclosure system that is outmoded and is incomprehensible." He adds: "The old
system was driven by a system of disclosure to avoid liability rather than to
inform investors." 
  Mr. Pitt represented AICPA, the industry's trade group, back in 1997 after
the SEC, under Mr. Levitt, announced a new regulatory board to set standards
for auditor independence. The panel, the Independence Standards Board, was
charged with issuing rules to keep public accounting firms from doing work that
could affect the quality and independence of their audits of companies'
financial statements. The move partly reflected the SEC's view that AICPA
wasn't preventing potential conflicts between the auditing and consulting sides
of the industry. 
  AICPA hired Mr. Pitt to submit a long proposal on how the new board should
govern firm's independence issues. In a "white paper" dated Oct. 20, 1997, Mr.
Pitt was listed as the primary author of the study, which attempted to
undermine the idea that independence restrictions were needed at all. Mr. Pitt
argued that the regulatory emphasis was "misplaced," and that there was no
cause for additional rules, much less an independent body to oversee the
accounting industry. The document also criticized the SEC, calling the move
"micro-regulation," and arguing that the industry should regulate itself. 
  And in a Oct. 22 speech before the accounting-industry trade group, Mr. Pitt
told the audience that the SEC has not "always been a kinder and gentler place
for accountants" and that under his watch, he will work to foster a "continuing
dialogue and partnership, with the accounting profession, and we will do
everything in our power to evidence a new era of respect and cooperation. Of
course, there is a catch -- we expect the same from you!"



SEC Chief Pitt Has Hands Full With Enron, Critics, Papers Say
2002-01-17 07:12 (New York)

     Washington, Jan. 17 (Bloomberg) -- SEC chairman Harvey Pitt
is talking about new accounting standards following the Enron
Corp. bankruptcy, although critics say his potential conflicts of
interest seem troubling, the Wall Street Journal and New York
Times reported.
     Some lawmakers say Pitt should remove himself from any Enron
inquiry because of his history as a lawyer representing large
accounting firms, including Arthur Andersen LLP, Enron's outside
auditor, the Journal said, citing Democratic Senator Jon Corzine.
     In a meeting in December with accounting industry officials
over the Enron mess, he urged them to issue a statement that was
critical of the accounting system, and not the industry, the
Journal says.
     The agency's board currently has three of the five
commission slots unfilled and the Republican in the fifth slot has
announced her intention to leave soon, the Times said.
Replacements could come from the accounting industry, and that
could hinder reform, it said.


UPDATE: Bush Adviser Watched Enron's Woes Spread
2002-01-16 22:17 (New York)

  By Jeanne Cummings and Jim VandeHei 
  Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal 

  WASHINGTON -- President Bush's top economic advisers monitored Enron Corp.'s
collapse last fall and its impact on the economy and natural-gas markets, but
never shared their findings with the president, the White House said. 
  Lawrence Lindsey, head of the White House's National Economic Council and a
former consultant to Enron until 2000, and Council of Economic Advisers
Chairman Glenn Hubbard conducted the review without contacting the
energy-trading company directly, Mr. Lindsey and White House officials said. 
  The monitoring began in mid-October, when Enron posted a huge third-quarter
loss. Beyond the energy sector, the economic experts focused attention on
currency markets, equity markets, bond markets and other financial indicators
looking for signs that investors were pulling out significant amounts of money,
which could lead to more-widespread problems. 
  Mr. Lindsey said in an interview that he and other senior administration
officials were concerned that Enron's troubles could rattle the markets "to the
point that they would become dysfunctional, and might have an effect on the
broader economy." He didn't inform the president because the markets "resumed
function rather quickly," and "other players" came into the natural-gas and
energy markets to pick up the slack. 
  "The system worked," Mr. Lindsey said. 
  Last fall, Enron's financial troubles were discussed on several occasions by
the White House economic team during weekly meetings. That group includes Mr.
Lindsey, Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and Commerce Secretary Donald Evans,
both of whom received appeals for help from Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay in late
October. Mr. Evans and Mr. O'Neill decided it wasn't appropriate for them to
take action. 
  After a second call from Mr. Lay, Mr. O'Neill instructed Treasury
Undersecretary Peter Fisher to analyze what Enron's collapse would mean for the
energy sector and the markets, and whether the government should consider a
bailout. Mr. Fisher concluded it shouldn't. 
  White House press officials said Mr. Lindsey's staff coordinated their review
with Mr. Fisher and Energy Department officials. 
  Meanwhile, Rep. Henry Waxman, a senior Democrat on the House Energy and
Commerce Committee, sent a new letter to Vice President Dick Cheney in which
the California lawmaker renewed his request for more details about six meetings
Mr. Cheney and his staff held with Enron officials last year. Four of those
meetings took place during the period when Mr. Cheney was overseeing the
drafting of the administration's national energy policy. 
  In a 34-page study he released yesterday, Mr. Waxman argues that Enron held
undue sway in that process and managed to insert a disproportionate number of
the company's priorities into the administration's plan. But outside energy
experts say the White House report is largely a rhetorical document that
includes recommendations long sought by dozens of energy interest groups.


Former Lieberman Aide Worked for Enron as Lobbyist, AP Says
2002-01-17 07:50 (New York)

     Washington, Jan. 17 (Bloomberg) -- Former Enron Corp.
lobbyist Michael Lewan, who was U.S. Senator Joseph Lieberman's
chief of staff from 1989-92, met three times in June and July with
the senator's staff as a lobbyist, the Associated Press reported.
     The former top aide of the Connecticut Democrat tried
unsuccessfully to set up meetings with Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay,
AP said. Lieberman, the 2000 Democratic vice presidential
candidate, is investigating the collapse of the failed energy
company. Lewan said he worked as an Enron lobbyist from June
through November, earning some $40,000, AP said.
     While Lieberman spokesman Dan Gerstein confirmed the
contacts, he insisted they wouldn't affect the investigation, AP
said. While Lieberman was aware Enron was Lewan's client, they
didn't talk about the company, Gerstein told AP.
     Lewan said he wasn't hired to lobby Lieberman and wouldn't
want to be a political burden to his personal friend, AP said.
Lieberman's Senate Governmental Affairs Committee is to begin
hearings Wednesday on Enron, AP said.

US Govt Agencies To Study Retirement-Plan Security
2002-01-16 20:58 (New York)

  By Kathy Chen 
  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 

  WASHINGTON -- Administration officials appear to favor taking limited steps
to improve the security of retirement savings following the Enron Corp.
debacle, but haven't ruled out stronger measures. 
  Ann Combs, assistant secretary for the Labor Department's Pension and Welfare
Benefits Administration, said it is too early to say what specific
recommendations will be issued by a presidential task force that includes the
Labor Department. But she said her agency is "very strongly in favor" of
improving access to investment advice and that "we don't want to go overboard"
on regulating retirement funds. Current regulations restrict employers and
investment companies that they retain from providing investment advice to
employees. 
  President Bush directed the Labor, Treasury and Commerce departments to set
up a task force last week, after the Enron bankruptcy wiped out the retirement
nest eggs of thousands of Enron employees, whose 401(k) plans were heavily
invested in Enron stock. 
  Ms. Combs said the task force is taking a two-pronged approach to examine
ways to strengthen retirement security. First, it is looking for potential
problems with employers' restrictions on portfolio diversification and
employees selling their company's stock. Regulators are also looking at whether
employees are getting adequate investment advice and whether the government has
sufficient enforcement tools to protect workers' pensions. 
  The agencies also plan to look at the broader issue of whether existing
pension-plan rules, passed in 1974, are outdated, Ms. Combs said. In recent
years, growing numbers of employees have shifted from traditional pension plans
to defined contribution plans, such as 401(k)s. "We need to make sure laws are
adequate to protect people under both," Ms. Combs said. 
  Ms. Combs said the White House hasn't taken a formal stand on existing
legislation, including a bill introduced by Sens. Barbara Boxer (D., Calif.)
and Jon Corzine (D., N.J.) to restrict the amount of company stock in 401(k)
plans and allow workers to freely sell their company stock. 
  While the task force will look at whether employers should be able to
prohibit workers from selling their company stocks and whether plans could
include company stocks, "we need to work closely with Congress to strike the
right balance," Ms. Combs said. Employers aren't required to offer 401(k) plans
or to make matching contributions, she said, "so we don't want to go
overboard." She also questioned how to administer any proposed limits on the
amount of company stocks in 401(k) plans. 
  Karen Friedman, director of policy at the Pension Rights Center, a consumer
advocacy group in Washington, said, "financial education is one step, but
that's not going to solve the problem. You need stronger laws on the books to
protect workers." She said measures are needed to limit how much employee
contributions could go to their company stocks and to allow employees to move
investments out of their company stocks. 
  The task force hasn't set a deadline for issuing policy recommendations but
wants to move "very expeditiously," Ms. Combs said. The three departments'
secretaries met for the first time last week, and another meeting is set for
today. 


Enron Europe's Eric Shaw Comments on Collapse, Implications
2002-01-17 03:43 (New York)

     Berlin, Jan. 17 (Bloomberg) -- The following are comments by
Eric Shaw, vice president of Enron Europe, on the collapse of
Enron Corp. and its implications for the European power-trading
market. Shaw made the comments at an energy conference in Berlin:

On the current situation:
     ``The current situation of Enron Europe is that we're under
administration under U.K. law. We're being run by the
administrators of PriceWaterhouseCoopers and a small group of
employees has been retained to help the administrators maximize
the value of the stake for the creditors. That's mostly involved
the liquidation processes, unwinding our trading positions, the
sales of various parts of our businesses. You'll see small bits
and pieces of what we've had before being distributed among the
industry. Most of the activity will be done in the next months but
it could stretch out for a long time.''

On Enron's collapse:
     ``It was very simple why Enron has collapsed. A large and
sophisticated trading operation depends almost exclusively on
confidence associated with that trading operation of both the
counterparties in that operation and the sources that finance it.
Through a confluence of events in the second half of last year we
suffered a dramatic loss of confidence. At the end we ended up
with few counterparties and almost no finance. Once you've lost
those two things it's very clear that the end is near and it was
surprising how quickly the end came.''
     ``Why did confidence evaporate? There was a complete lack of
trust in what Enron was saying and the numbers it put out to the
community. I honestly don't know why that happened but I'm
confident that the truth will come out.''

On Enron Europe:
     ``The core energy trading business was sound. We had a
profitable and healthy business in power and gas and was highly
successful in gaining both market share and opening up markets
across Europe. There was no giant black hole in the trading
operations.''

On affect on trading in Europe:
     ``Low and behold we had some drama. We had some terrible
spikes in power prices in December. It was the collapse of Enron.
A large part of the wholesale trading market in gas and power
disappeared overnight. Liquidity disappeared and has reduced
dramatically. That resulted in the fact that exogenous shocks had
an amplifying effect on prices. We've had a very cold weather down
south, which led to some big spikes because there wasn't enough
liquidity to absorb those spikes in the market. The evidence is
that liquidity is coming back to the market. As people have come
back from their Christmas holidays power prices started coming
down and that effect was seen across Europe. The same in the gas
markets.''

On credit ratings, the future:
     ``It'll be a tremendous focus on credit ratings. Where as
before the old world almost had a threshold above which you didn't
really have to worry about investment and credit ratings. Just
having that is clearly not sufficient. If you want to participate
in this market you have to make sure your organization has not
only a very solid credit rating but also a fair degree of
confidence behind its physical ability to deliver what it's
contracted to deliver and general confidence in the business
principles.
      ``Some say this is a clear example of why these types of
market participants shouldn't be in because they disappear over
night. I tend to agree with that. Clearly customers and
participants need to be critically focused and ask if a company
delivers what it's contracted to deliver and does it have the
financial resources to make good on the damages it may cause. But
I think those who say this kind of liberalization experiment
didn't work are dead wrong. The more liberalized a market is, the
more it can cope with an exuberant shock like this.''

On opportunities:
     ``For the exchanges, there should be a huge opportunity
especially to the extend that the exchanges will develop
mechanisms to take care of the credit problem. The industry must
push hard to get those structures in place. Enron in the past may
have not been as big a proponent of that as others. The
consolidation of exchanges, the implementation of a clear, good
and strong processes of these over-the-counter and futures
transactions will help a lot of people confidence back in this
market.

On lessons learned:
     ``For the European market the lessons to be learned will be
the lessons about pride and humans. For the gas and power markets
we can sum them up by (philosopher Friedrich) Nietzsche: `Whatever
does not kill me will make me stronger.'
     ``Employees in the U.S., especially those close to retirement
age, suffered most from having their pension and retirement funds
tied to the stock. Reform is necessary there.''


IntercontinentalExchange Gaining From Enron's Collapse, FT Says
2002-01-17 00:14 (New York)

     Singapore, Jan. 17 (Bloomberg) -- Trading volume on
IntercontinentalExchange, an online commodity bourse, has risen 30
percent this month from December levels after the collapse of U.S.
energy trading firm Enron Corp., the Financial Times reported,
citing Chuck Vice, IntercontinentalExchange's chief executive.
     Vice attributed the increase to users seeking to ``minimize
exposure to any one firm by broadly distributing business across a
large and diverse group of counterparties,'' the FT said.
     IntercontinentalExchange plans to begin clearing services
next month to protect users from the risk of default by
counterparties they deal with through the service, the report
cited Vice as saying.
     Earlier this month, IntercontinentalExchange said the number
of participating firms and users on its service in 2001 increased
by more than 400 percent against 2000. The online trading service
recorded natural gas trading volume of 500 billion cubic feet on
Dec. 27, breaking the previous daily record set on Dec. 4 by 18
percent.

Joint Venture: A 1997 Enron Meeting Belies Officers' Claims They Were in the Dark --- Minutes Show Them Hearing Of Novel Partnerships That Inflated Earnings --- Present: Lay, Skilling, Fastow

HOUSTON -- On Nov. 5, 1997, the top echelon of Enron Corp. assembled for a meeting that would help put the energy-trading giant on a fateful and ultimately disastrous course. 
On that day, Enron's now-infamous outside partnership arrangements took a turn from the straightforward and mundane to the deceptive and possibly illegal. The seven-member executive committee of the company's board approved a management proposal to provide several hundred million dollars in loan guarantees for a new partnership named for the Star Wars character Chewbacca.
While Enron had done business with previous partnerships, Chewco Investments was different. Unlike others where Enron had an ownership stake, Chewco was supposed to be completely independent. But it would be run and partly owned by an Enron executive, a young rising star named Michael Kopper. 
Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay arrived a little late, according to minutes of the meeting obtained by The Wall Street Journal. He came in while Andrew Fastow, then senior vice president of finance, outlined a transaction that would allow Chewco to buy, for $383 million, part of Enron's stake in another limited partnership known as JEDI. The deal kept JEDI in the Enron family, but off its books. That's because under accounting rules, Chewco provided enough independent ownership of JEDI to let Enron treat it as separate. 
However, with Enron financial guarantees and an Enron official at the helm, there were questions from the beginning of how independent Chewco really was. Chewco thus set the pattern for a series of transactions that would massively inflate Enron's earnings, while hiding billions in debt from shareholders and creditors. 
Four years later, on Nov. 8 last year, Enron acknowledged in a federal filing that it had overstated earnings by nearly $600 million since 1997. About two-thirds of that, it told the Securities and Exchange Commission, was because Chewco and JEDI had improperly been treated as separate entities able to do income-producing deals with Enron. The disclosure sent a signal that Enron hadn't been playing straight, and what had been an exodus of investors and trading partners turned into a stampede. Within a month, Enron sought bankruptcy-law protection. 
Federal investigators and private litigators are now intently trying to learn who knew what about Chewco, and when. Top former officials have distanced themselves from it. In October, after the Journal first disclosed Chewco's existence, Mr. Lay privately told other Enron officials that he had never heard of the partnership, according to one company executive. His wife, Linda Lay, told NBC recently that her husband had been kept in the dark about a lot of the company's doings. Mr. Lay, who resigned from Enron last month, couldn't be reached for comment and his attorney didn't return calls. 
Jeffrey Skilling, who resigned suddenly as Enron's chief executive last summer, said in press interviews late in December that he knew few details about the partnership. Yesterday, a spokeswoman for Mr. Skilling said, "We aren't going to comment on leaks, counter-leaks, spin or speculation." An attorney for Mr. Kopper declined to comment. An attorney for Mr. Fastow said only that his client didn't have any financial interest in Chewco. 
The meeting's minutes and other recently obtained documents show plenty of people at Enron knew about Chewco. Messrs. Lay, Skilling and Fastow were part of the 1997 executive-committee meeting. So were several board members. One -- Herbert "Pug" Winokur Jr., chairman of Capricorn Holdings Inc. in Greenwich, Conn. -- felt comfortable enough with Chewco that he approved its creation from an airport while boarding a flight. 
W. Neil Eggleston, an attorney for Mr. Winokur and other outside directors, says the executive committee was told that "Chewco was a special-purpose vehicle not affiliated with the company. The board never waived the conflict-of-interest policy for Mr. Kopper nor was the board told that Mr. Kopper was involved with Chewco." The meeting minutes indicate that Mr. Kopper was in attendance, though the document misspells his name. The minutes don't show whether he was introduced or took part. 
During the presentation about Chewco, the meeting minutes say, Mr. Fastow "reviewed the economics of the project, the financing arrangements and the corporate structure." Among the benefits the partnership was supposed to bring was "positive income impact to Enron," according to a handout appended to the minutes. The handout included diagrams of the complex financial structure. 
Chewco isn't an issue just for Enron. Joseph Berardino, chief executive of longtime Enron auditor Arthur Andersen LLP, told Congress in December that his firm never would have let Enron treat Chewco and JEDI as arm's-length, separate entities had it known the entire truth about the entities' financing arrangements. At the time Chewco was being formed, Enron officials told Barclays PLC, a lender involved in the deal, that Andersen had reviewed the transaction's structure and approved it, according to someone familiar with the discussions. 
A Barclays spokesman declines to comment. Andersen says Mr. Berardino, who is scheduled to testify again next week before a House committee, stands by his statement that his firm didn't know all the relevant facts about Chewco four years ago. 
Chewco altered a financial tool long used by the energy industry. Enron had at times relied on off-balance-sheet partnerships and similar entities, as had many competitors. Traditional "off-balance-sheet financing is the technique that has been used to build the independent power industry in the United States," says Didi Lacher, a New York executive of the German financial firm Helaba. With such entities, companies can share the cost and risk of developing, say, a well or pipeline. By having the partnership borrow the money, the company can also keep the debt off its own balance sheet. 
This financing is "nonrecourse," meaning the sponsoring company isn't on the hook for the debt. But Enron kept off its balance sheet some debt in which it had to cover any shortfalls, because of the partnerships' arrangements. Over time, Enron accumulated billions of dollars of potential liability, little of it publicly evident. 
To do outside partnerships, some basic accounting guidelines have to be followed. The company has to relinquish control of any assets put into the partnership. It can't have side deals that oblige it to repurchase or redeem the assets during the partnerships' lives, typically five to 10 years. Since 1996, a partnership also has had to attract outside equity equal to at least 3% of its total capital in order to be considered separate from the sponsoring company. Enron's partnerships appear to have met these standards for many years, but eventually Enron started to look at a higher-octane partnership. 
Enron under Mr. Lay assembled a team of bright young executives intent on building a global energy power. Led by Mr. Skilling, a former McKinsey & Co. consultant, the core of the team started working together at Enron Capital and Trade Resources, which handled energy trading and marketing. His lieutenants included Mr. Fastow, a former Continental Bank finance specialist, and Richard Causey, a former Andersen official. 
They figured that for Enron to grow quickly, it couldn't be weighed down with debt. Too much debt would threaten the company's credit rating and make its financing costs higher. 
Mr. Skilling and his subordinates placed an emphasis on rapid-fire trading and deal-making, rather than on long-term investments in power plants and other "hard" assets. The traditional partnership approach was too cumbersome and confining to achieve this. Enron would have to negotiate for months with partners, banks and other outsiders before getting a deal going. "Enron didn't like being told no," says one former senior Enron executive. So Mr. Skilling and Mr. Fastow "found a way to avoid the discussion altogether." 
The solution: bring the partnerships in house, without appearing to do so, say people involved in setting up the structures. 
In 1995, according to people familiar with the matter, Mr. Fastow began approaching investment banks with a novel proposal. He wanted them to help him recruit investors for partnerships that would do business with Enron. But the partnerships would be partly owned and run by Enron executives. Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, for one, turned him down, figuring the potential conflicts of interest were too great. 
Mr. Fastow and other Enron officials continued their discussions with various banks to no avail. All the while, pressure was building. By 1997, company executives would later acknowledge, debt levels were getting worrisomely high. The company was also having a tough time meeting its earnings projections. 
That's when Chewco was presented to the board in the November 1997 meeting. Having met resistance from investment banks, Enron officials turned to commercial banks to lend money to Chewco as well as to two small entities, also connected to Mr. Kopper. These two put the crucial 3% of outside equity into Chewco that allowed it to be treated as separate from Enron. 
After Chewco was set up, Enron's profit performance began to improve and its expansion pace intensified. Mr. Skilling and his team ascended the ranks. By 1998, he was Enron's chief operating officer, Mr. Fastow was chief financial officer and Mr. Causey was chief accounting officer. 
Chewco became a template. In June 1999, the board held a special meeting to hear Messrs. Skilling and Fastow outline plans for a new partnership known as LJM Cayman LP. It was designed to resolve "certain challenges" in protecting the value of a growing portfolio of volatile telecommunications assets, according to an excerpt from the meeting's minutes. The LJM name came from the initials of Mr. Fastow's wife and two children. 
Four months later, the Enron executives proposed to the board an even more ambitious partnership, dubbed LJM2 Co-Investment LP, to serve as a repository for other risky bets made by the company. 
Both LJMs were managed and partly owned by Mr. Fastow. In an SEC filing, Enron recently estimated he made more than $30 million from his participation in the entities. At least several million dollars of this was management fees -- a generous sum given that, in one presentation, Mr. Fastow said he worked just three hours a week on partnership matters. 
A spokesman for Mr. Fastow declines to comment on how much he made from the partnerships or on LJM generally. In the past, representatives of the former CFO have pointed to Enron statements that its board and top management reviewed and approved both the creation and operation of the LJM partnerships. 
Some Enron insiders say that whatever Mr. Fastow earned from the LJM partnerships was a pittance compared with the benefits they provided the company. As Enron's growth exploded in the late 1990s, worries mounted over debt levels, and the company needed help producing cash flow and earnings. Increasingly, Enron came to rely on the partnerships to take debt and troubled assets off its books and produce transactions that could be reported as profits. How much Mr. Fastow made from the LJMs was of little concern to top management, says one former Enron executive, because the CFO was the one person who could consistently pull "their nuts out of the fire with some fancy transactions." 
By the year 2000, the LJM partnerships were providing more than 40% of Enron's reported pretax income of about $1.4 billion, according to a recent SEC filing by the company. 
All told, the LJM partnerships raised about $400 million from outside investors and eventually did billions of dollars of transactions with Enron. Substructures of the LJM latticework proliferated with the creation of other entities. In a May 1, 2000, presentation to the finance committee of Enron's board, management described how an LJM offshoot called Project Raptor would "hedge the profit & loss volatility of Enron investments," according to internal documents from that meeting. 
As part of the project, another entity called Talon was to be created with seed capital of $400 million and an initial capacity to provide "approximately $200 million of P&L protection" to Enron, according to one document. LJM2 would be the outside investor in Talon and "be entitled to a 30% annualized return plus fees," it said. 
At the finance-committee meeting, its minutes show, Mr. Causey said Andersen "had spent considerable time analyzing the Talon structure and the governance structure of LJM2 and was comfortable with the proposed transaction." The committee approved the Raptor-Talon plan. 
Mr. Causey's attorney, J.C. Nickens, says that his client believes the treatment of the partnerships "was an appropriate interpretation of the accounting rules as they existed then and as they still exist today." 
Though the minutes said there was "discussion" of the Raptor arrangement, neither those minutes nor similar recountings of other board gatherings indicate that directors seemed particularly concerned about what was happening under the LJM umbrella. They might well have been. By last fall, public concern over the transactions had plunged Enron into crisis. Now, investigators are trying to make sense of hundreds of other Enron-related entities with names like Braveheart, Rawhide and Bobcat. The big question: Which, if any, may contain LJM-like problems?

THE NATION THE FALL OF ENRON Ex-Enron CEO Agrees to Testify Before Panel Energy: Appearance by Skilling called critical by chairman of subcommittee looking into firm's downfall.

WASHINGTON -- Jeffrey K. Skilling, who unexpectedly quit as Enron Corp. chief executive in August, has agreed to testify next week before Congress, a Senate subcommittee chairman said Thursday. 
Congressional investigators are eager to hear from Skilling, who has denied any wrongdoing in the events leading to the energy company's Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing Dec. 2.
But another Enron executive, Sherron S. Watkins, wrote to Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay in August that Skilling had been warned about the company's problems by other executives, including former Vice Chairman J. Clifford Baxter, who died last week in an apparent suicide. 
"Skilling is critical," said Sen. Byron L. Dorgan (D-N.D.), who chairs the Senate Commerce Committee's subcommittee on consumer affairs. 
The committee also has asked for the testimony of fired Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow, who allegedly set up many of the off-the-books partnerships that were instrumental in the company's collapse. Fastow has not responded to the committee, Dorgan said. 
A spokeswoman for Skilling confirmed that he had agreed to testify voluntarily and would do so without a grant of immunity. 
"He wants to be open and forthcoming with all committees investigating this matter," Judy Leon said. 
Exactly when and where Skilling will testify next week is unclear. He is listed as a witness at a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing Thursday. Dorgan's committee and others among the dozen congressional panels investigating the Enron collapse also are seeking his testimony. 
"There are competing invitations, and that is complicating the scheduling," Leon said. 
Lay, who replaced Skilling as chief executive and was ousted from that position last week, is scheduled to testify before Dorgan's committee Monday. 
Dorgan said both men are likely to say Enron's collapse was due to circumstances beyond their control, but that his panel was prepared to counter such claims with internal documents showing that Enron's board of directors knew about the partnerships. 
"It's sufficient to say that the board of directors discussed on various occasions the creation of partnerships, the structure of the business deals," Dorgan said. 
In other developments, Rep. George Miller (D-Martinez) called on House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) to be the "gatekeeper" in determining whether immunity is granted to witnesses in the Enron investigation and what documents are made public. 
Complaining about leaks of documents that damaged other cases, Miller wrote Hastert: "The failure to honor confidentiality, the untimely release of information or the inappropriate granting of immunity all have great potential to compromise and undermine [potential] criminal prosecutions of Enron and [accounting firm] Arthur Andersen." 
Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) called on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to provide her with a list of all meetings and phone calls that took place between Enron executives and FERC commissioners. 
"Every day more and more alarming information is revealed concerning Enron's role in prolonging the California electricity crisis," she said in a letter to FERC Chairman Patrick H. Wood III. 
The FERC said this week that it would investigate allegations that Enron used its market clout to artificially inflate long-term electricity prices on the West Coast. On Thursday, at a FERC-sponsored conference in New York on power supplies in the Northeast, Wood told Reuters news service that its inquiry had begun. 
In a letter to Wood on Thursday, Gov. Gray Davis urged FERC to expedite the inquiry and expand it to include other energy marketers. 
"California has a special interest in getting to the bottom of such charges, since this state bore the brunt of the marketers' price gouging," Davis wrote.

At Lay hearings, lawmakers out to lift 'shroud of secrecy' 
By JULIE MASON 
Copyright 2002 Houston Chronicle Washington Bureau 
Feb. 1, 2002, 12:21AM
WASHINGTON -- Lawmakers signaled Thursday that their questioning of former Enron Corp. Chairman Ken Lay on Capitol Hill next week is likely to be confrontational when he delivers his first public explanation of the company's collapse. 
Congressional investigators want to know how Enron executives were able to cash out millions of dollars in company stock while employees saw their retirement savings wiped out. 
The so-called "lockdown," which prevented employees from selling stock, and Enron's use of partnerships to shield its debt also are among issues lawmakers want to pursue. 
In negotiating Lay's Monday appearances before the Senate Commerce and the House Financial Services committees, his attorneys did not seek immunity or any restrictions on what he could say, lawmakers and Lay's attorney said Thursday. 
"The shroud of secrecy that has surrounded so much of what this corporation has done shall not be allowed to stand," said Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., a member of the Senate Commerce Committee, where Lay is to testify first. 
Lawmakers are complaining that Enron is not cooperating with requests for information. 
"Every day it becomes more clear that this corporation resorted to a variety of legal, regulatory and accounting contortions to keep investors and the American public in the dark," said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., also a member of the Senate committee. 
Dorgan said the committee has repeatedly asked Enron to provide information about the estimated 3,000 related partnerships the company had on its books. 
"To date, the corporation has provided no information to the committee about these partnerships," Dorgan said. "We have sent a second letter to the corporation asking for that information, and again they are failing to cooperate." 
Bob Bennett, attorney for Enron in Washington, said Dorgan is mistaken. 
"I am terribly disappointed he would say that because we have been fully cooperative with them," Bennett said. "There have been some documents they asked for that we did not have dealing with these partnerships, nor would we be expected to have them." 
The disputed documents, according to Bennett, involve independent partnerships and records that Enron does not have. 
Enron's Dec. 2 bankruptcy was the largest in corporate history. The collapse of the company cost thousands of employees their jobs and wiped out most of their retirement accounts, much of which were tied up in Enron stock. 
Lawmakers want to know when Lay became aware of the company's financial problems, and whether executives hid Enron's true financial picture from employees and investors. 
"We know for example that bankruptcy didn't treat everyone alike, we know there are some who made millions while others lost their life savings," Dorgan said. "We also know that this corporation created off-the-books partnerships in a very aggressive way, thousands of them, with strange-sounding names but even stranger architecture in terms of how they were created." 
Wyden compared the conduct of Enron executives to captains on a rapidly-sinking ship. 
"They locked the workers down there in the boiler room," Wyden said. 
The House and Senate hearings set for Monday are among at least 10 congressional investigations under way into the collapse of the one-time energy giant. 
In addition to Lay, witnesses before the House committee Monday will include Arthur Andersen CEO Joseph Berardino and Harvey Pitt, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Since Enron's troubles first garnered national attention months ago, Lay, who resigned as chairman last week, has remained publicly silent as various investigations unfolded into possible malfeasance at the company. 
Last week, Lay's wife, Linda, discussed the couple's troubles on a television morning show. 
Dorgan said the Senate committee has a tentative agreement with Enron's former chief executive officer, Jeff Skilling, to testify at a later date. 
The committee also has tried to arrange for testimony from Andrew Fastow, former chief financial for Enron, with no success. 
"We, in my judgment, will have to hear from Mr. Fastow, the question is how," Dorgan said. "At this point we have had no response at all from registered letters we've sent." 
Skilling and Fastow, central figures in the free fall at Enron, are both scheduled to testify next week before the House Energy and Commerce Committee's subcommittee on oversight and investigation. 
Dorgan said that more than 40 boxes of documents previously submitted by Enron to the committee contain notes from meetings of the Enron board of directors. 
The Washington Post on Thursday reported that Enron's board received detailed briefings and signed off on the use of related partnerships, dating back at least four years. 
Dorgan declined to provide significant details about the documents his committee received. 
"It's sufficient to say that the board of directors discussed, on various occasions, the creation of partnerships, the structure of the business deals. But I think you will hear more about that in the hearings," Dorgan said. 
The controversial partnerships are a key element in the investigation of Enron's collapse because the company used the vehicles to shield its debt and appear more profitable. 
President Bush, whose administration has come under scrutiny for its close ties to Lay and Enron, made an indirect reference to the controversy Thursday. 
Speaking of the need for a "responsibility culture," he said companies must be honest in their financial reporting. 
"Let's make sure when you account for losses and profits that you put it all on your books so everybody understands," Bush said in Atlanta. 
In addition to questions about the partnerships, Wyden said lawmakers will have questions about Enron's foray into California energy markets, and particularly whether Enron manipulated markets on the West Coast. 
"The common culprit in my view has been secrecy and a lack of cooperation from this company," Wyden said. "It is now high time for Congress to flip on the light and get to the bottom of this situation."

An attorney for Enron Corp. said yesterday that the company cannot provide Congress with the names of the investors in the controversial partnerships the company used to move millions of dollars in debt off its books and whose losses triggered the company's fall into bankruptcy. 
"You have to go to the entities to get that information," Robert Bennett, a Washington lawyer representing Enron, said of the partnerships. "We do not have control over those documents. They are separate entities."
Bennett made his statement after Sen. Byron L. Dorgan (D-N.D.) held a news conference criticizing Enron for failing to provide congressional investigators on the Senate Commerce Committee with the names of investors and other information about the partnerships. The committee is holding hearings Monday at which former Enron chairman Kenneth L. Lay is expected to give his first public account of the company's collapse. Lay was not granted immunity from prosecution in exchange for his testimony, officials said. 
"I know that Enron has some records about these entities or that would be malfeasance," Dorgan said. "Essentially they are just stalling." 
Dorgan said he thinks Enron created more than 3,000 partnerships, known as special-purpose entities. Written minutes from meetings of the company's board of directors suggest that the partnerships were a key part of Enron's growth strategy and show that they were regularly reviewed by the board. 
The partnerships are a major focus of investigators trying fathom what led to Enron's Dec. 2 bankruptcy filing, which came less than a month after Enron disclosed that since 1997 financial statements audited by the big accounting firm Arthur Andersen had overstated Enron's profits by almost $600 million and understated its debts by more than $1 billion. 
A dozen congressional committees, as well as the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission, are probing Enron's demise, which cost investors and employees billions of dollars. A focus of the inquiries is whether Enron hid debt and inflated its profits by using the private partnerships run by its chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. 
Dorgan said that as of yesterday evening, Fastow has failed to respond to repeated requests to testify before the senator's subcommittee. He said that Jeffrey K. Skilling, Enron's former chief executive, has said he will appear, but not on Monday. 
Fastow and Skilling are scheduled to appear before the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigations next Thursday. Two other former Enron executives and one board member are also expected to testify. The subcommittee has subpoenaed another former executive, Michael Kopper. Kopper handled financial transactions at Enron and headed at least two off-the-books partnerships. 
Skilling resigned in August. Fastow was ousted in October. When it was then disclosed that Fastow made $30 million running partnerships with names such as LJM, Raptor and Jedi, Lay announced that the board was setting up a committee to investigate. 
Enron board member William C. Powers Jr. chairs that special committee and is expected to testify Monday before the House Financial Services Committee. The Powers special committee is about to release a report on its findings. 
Bennett has said that while Enron's board of directors was aware that special-purpose entities were being set up, there was "a great deal of information regarding their operation and execution that was unknown to the board of directors." 
Asked about the report yesterday, Bennett said he doesn't know when it will come out or what will be in it. 
In December, Dorgan's subcommittee sent a letter to Enron requesting "the number of partnerships, the investors in the partnerships and a range of information about these 'off the books' partnerships," Dorgan said. "To date the corporation has provided no information to the committee about these partnerships." 
In response, Bennett said, "I think that's grossly unfair, and I'm sorry the senator would say that. I wish the senator had called me. I can only assume he's terribly misinformed. We're cooperating fully with this committee and the dozen others that have contacted us." But, he said, the company can't produce documents it has no control over. 
Dorgan called that explanation "implausible." 
As to whether board members knew the names of investors in the partnerships, W. Neil Eggleston, an attorney for the outside directors, referred questions to the company. 
The names of the investors in one partnership, LJM2 Capital Management LP, were disclosed in a court filing by Alpine Investment Partners, the lead plaintiff in a suit against the partnership, Bloomberg News reported. About 90 employees of Merrill Lynch invested a total of $16 million in the partnership. Merrill had been hired by Enron to raise money for the fund. Other investors listed in the document include units of American International Group, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Citigroup, Travelers Insurance Co., the Arkansas Teachers Retirement System, and the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. 
Meanwhile, a group of students and alumni has asked Harvard University to review its ties to Enron and questioned whether Enron board member Herbert Winokur broke insider-trading laws as a member of the board that oversees Harvard's investments. A report by the group questions whether Harvard made as much as $50 million through investments managed by Highfields Capital at a time when Enron stock began falling. "Mr. Winokur had no involvement in Highfields Capital, and any suggestion that he tipped the fund to short-sell Enron stock is just plain wrong," Eggleston said.

ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: THE INVESTIGATION
Senator Says Enron Refuses To Cooperate
By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

02/01/2002
The New York Times

c. 2002 New York Times Company

WASHINGTON, Jan. 31 -- Enron has refused to turn over to a Senate panel records of controversial partnerships that are crucial to understanding the company's downfall, the panel's chairman said today. 
The chairman, Senator Byron L. Dorgan, said that despite repeated requests, Enron continued to refuse to turn over records of 3,000 partnerships. Investigators say Enron used the arrangements to bolster the company's financial statements while hiding hundreds of millions of dollars in losses.
''They just simply have not cooperated,'' Mr. Dorgan said, adding that ''the shroud of secrecy that surrounds so much of what this corporation has done will not be allowed to stand.'' But he did not say whether the committee was considering a subpoena. 
Mr. Dorgan, a North Dakota Democrat who is chairman of the consumer affairs subcommittee of the Senate Commerce Committee, said lawyers for Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's former chairman and chief executive, assured his staff on Wednesday that Mr. Lay would appear on Monday to testify before Congress. His lawyers have not sought immunity for the testimony, Mr. Dorgan said. 
Mr. Dorgan also said another former Enron chief executive, Jeffrey K. Skilling, had agreed to testify in coming weeks. But he said the company's former chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, who Enron says made more than $30 million from his dealings with the partnerships, has not responded to repeated registered letters asking him to testify. A spokesman for Mr. Fastow declined comment today. 
Late today, another Congressional committee investigating Enron's downfall, the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said both Mr. Skilling and Mr. Fastow would testify next Thursday, along with Enron's chief accounting officer, Richard A. Causey; its chief risk officer, Richard B. Buy; and the board of directors' audit committee chairman, Robert K. Jaedicke. A former Enron executive who was involved in the partnerships, Michael Kopper, has also been subpoenaed to appear. 
A lawyer for Enron, Robert S. Bennett, disputed Mr. Dorgan's characterization of the company's cooperation, saying the senator had been ''terribly misinformed.'' 
''We have been fully cooperative with that committee,'' Mr. Bennett said. ''There are some documents that the committee would like to get that we have no access to and no control over, and I believe that may be what is raising this issue. But he is getting bad information.'' 
At the Senate hearing on Monday morning, Mr. Lay, who was ousted from his job by Enron's creditors last week, is expected to testify that important details of the partnerships and investments were kept from him and the board. 
Many investigators doubt his claims of ignorance, and Mr. Lay may be pressed about why he sold millions of dollars of Enron stock last year even as he promoted the value of the shares to Wall Street and his own employees. Minutes of Enron board meetings also show that Mr. Lay was present when the partnerships were discussed. Mr. Lay's lawyer, Earl J. Silbert, declined comment today, but in the past he has said that Mr. Lay was disposing of stock last year to pay down loans outside the company and that the sales did not reflect any doubts about Enron's future. 
Today, Mr. Dorgan said investigators had received 41 boxes of materials from Enron, which he declined to characterize. But he did say it was clear that members of the company's board had a fair degree of knowledge about the deals. 
Some people involved in the Congressional investigations had thought Mr. Lay was unlikely to testify before first reviewing a long-awaited report by a special committee of Enron directors into the company's deals with the partnerships. 
People close to the company said the report was expected to be finished sometime over the weekend. Before being released publicly, the report would have to be approved by the special committee and then have to be reviewed by the full board. 
The report is likely to draw distinctions about how much various people at Enron, including board members, Mr. Lay and other executives, knew concerning the partnerships, and how much responsibility various officials bear, a person close to the matter said. The report may also say board committees had differing levels of information about the deals, this person said. 
In an interview today, Mr. Dorgan said he intended to spend a lot of time during the hearing delving into details about the partnerships. But he said it was ''pretty hard to limit inquiries in circumstances like this.'' 
''I expect there will be attention to virtually all of the areas: 401(k) plans, insider trading, partnership construction, a whole series of things.'' 
Enron, he added, has said that some partnership information does not technically belong to the company and that as a result it does not have all that information. But, Mr. Dorgan said, ''in many cases, they own 97 percent of the partnerships,'' so they should be able to get it. 
William C. Powers Jr., the dean of the University of Texas School of Law, who is chairman of the Enron special committee preparing the report, declined to discuss the timing of the report's release or to give details. He would not even disclose whether he would be testifying before Congress next week, even though he is scheduled to do so. 
Mr. Powers said the work of the committee he heads ''is not precluding any other investigation from going forward with investigation, charges, punishment, whatever.'' The report, he said, will stand on its own, and ''government agencies can build on that if they find it useful.'' 
People at the law school said Mr. Powers was outraged at a suggestion published today in The Washington Post that he would be taking part in a concerted defense of Enron in his testimony before Congress. Mr. Powers has contended from the beginning of his investigation that his role is to produce an impartial report. 
Mr. Powers has come under fire from advocacy groups and from the local newspaper, The Austin American-Statesman, over accusations that his impartiality is compromised by the close ties between the University of Texas, and Enron and the law firms that have represented the company, especially Vinson & Elkins. 
The critics have said that the appearance of a conflict of interest is so great that Mr. Powers should not have taken on the assignment. 
''Dean Powers is a nice guy and a great professor, but unfortunately, looking at the facts, he has multiple apparent conflicts that, rightly or wrongly, cast a shadow on this report,'' said Cristen Feldman, a lawyer for Texans for Public Justice, a group that tracks campaign contributions in the state. 
In other Enron-related developments today, Representative George Miller, Democrat of California, asked that no witness in the House's various Enron hearings be given immunity without approval from Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, a Republican. 
Separately, the General Accounting Office, which is preparing to sue the White House to obtain records of meetings of executives at Enron and other energy companies with administration officials working on Vice President Dick Cheney's energy task force last spring, said it had hired the law firm of Sidley, Austin, Brown & Wood. 
In addition, Senators Max Baucus, a Montana Democrat who is the chairman of the Finance Committee, and Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the committee's senior Republican, sent letters to the United States Export-Import Bank, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation and the Trade and Development Agency requesting information on what help the federal agencies had given Enron. The committee is preparing for hearings into the company later. 
The chairman of an accounting ethics board, meanwhile, reaffirmed the board's decision to disband in light of the sketchy proposals by the Securities and Exchange Commission to restructure disciplinary rules. The chairman, Charles A. Bowsher, had announced that the Public Oversight Board would resign as a group partly in protest of the proposals by Harvey L. Pitt, the commission's chairman.

Governor Seeks Inquiry 
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 31 (AP) -- Gov. Gray Davis of California and Senator Barbara Boxer are asking regulators to investigate possible price manipulation by Enron during the state's energy crisis. 
Mr. Davis sent a letter today to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission after the release of a memo from Enron officials to the White House that outlines discussions between executives and the administration's energy task force headed by Vice President Cheney. 
In the memo, Mr. Lay urged Mr. Cheney to reject price caps on wholesale electricity that Mr. Davis and a host of other state officials wanted.

Probe likely to blame former execs 
Skilling, Fastow, auditors to be cited in report 
By TOM FOWLER 
Copyright 2002 Houston Chronicle 
Jan. 31, 2002, 11:14PM
Enron Corp.'s internal probe of partnerships that helped bring the company down will likely focus the blame on former executives Jeff Skilling and Andy Fastow and the company's auditors, say sources familiar with the investigation. 
The report, expected to be released this weekend, will probably say the two and the accounting firm of Arthur Andersen failed to give Enron's board of directors adequate information on the nature of the partnerships. 
Though Enron has acknowledged the board approved the formation of the partnerships and many of the deals, officials say the report will claim vital details were withheld. 
The leader of the investigation, William Powers, dean of the University of Texas School of Law, is expected to testify before the House Energy and Commerce Committee Tuesday. 
One source critical of the board said the directors were trying to deflect the blame. 
"It's like blaming a roofer for cracks in the foundation of your house," the source said. 
Enron's internal investigation began in late October shortly after the Securities and Exchange Commission started a formal investigation of off-balance-sheet partnerships formed by Fastow, then the chief financial officer. The partnerships enlisted outside investors to buy Enron assets as a means of helping the company artificially keep its debt level low and earnings high. 
Mistakes in the reporting of some transactions with two partnerships, LJM-Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment, forced the company to restate 4 1/2 years of earnings, including a reduction in reported profit by $586 million and add $2.5 billion in debt to its books. 
In November, the internal committee determined that Fastow and other employees had profited from investments in the partnerships. Those employees were fired. 
The report will be the first official word from the committee since then. At the insistence of creditors, it will be posted on Web sites of Enron and the U.S. bankruptcy court in New York. 
Enron officials declined comment on the report, as did representatives for Fastow and Skilling. 
An Andersen spokesman said Enron officials simply made some bad business decisions and are trying to blame the auditors. 
"The notion that the leaders on the board were not aware of these issues is absolutely implausible," said Andersen spokesman Patrick Dorton. "These were sophisticated people with sophisticated business advisers." 
Patrick McGurn with Institutional Shareholders Services, a company that advises shareholders on corporate governance issues, said Enron's board may have a valid argument if it can show it didn't know enough details to assess the risk involved. 
"There's a question as to who had the ability to see the big picture, if the board was so compartmentalized that they could only know one part of it at a time," McGurn said. 
It's not unusual for boards to see only summaries of very complicated deals and issues, McGurn said. 
"But even if all of this is true, it still means either the board wasn't diligent enough, it willingly went along with something that was wrong, or they were just stupid," he said. 
It's not clear if the report will also criticize Enron's longtime law firm, Vinson & Elkins. The firm did not help set up the LJM partnerships, but was asked to look into concerns raised by Enron executive Sherron Watkins in a now well-known October 2001 memo to Lay and the board. 
In an Oct. 15 letter to Enron general counsel James Derrick, V&E's Max Hendrick addressed some of those concerns, including the potential for conflicts of interest in Fastow's dual roles as Enron CFO and chief partner in the LJM partnerships, and the board's waiver of its code of ethics in meetings on June 28, 1999, and Oct. 11, 1999, to allow him to run the partnerships. 
The letter concluded that -- based on its interviews -- no outside counsel or auditors were needed to investigate the issues further. Hendrick did say, however, that "bad cosmetics" on the LJM partnerships and its investments in certain Enron technology and communications assets, coupled with the poor financial performance of those assets, could lead to a "serious risk of adverse publicity and litigation." 
The day after the letter was written, Enron began to unwind those investments with LJM. 
The fact that the code of ethics was waived to allow Fastow to run LJM is further indication that the board should have been more vigilant, said McGurn. 
McGurn and other observers are already questioning the impartiality of the investigation, given that many board members who approved parts of LJM are involved. But the presence of William McLucas, the former director of the Securities and Exchange Commission's division of enforcement, on the committee as general counsel will lend it more credibility, said one source. 
"Lucas is a notorious hard-ass," said the source, who asked not to be identified. "So I can't imagine he'll go too soft on anyone." 

Few of Lay Family's Real-Estate Assets Are on the Market, Listing Records Show
By Gary McWilliams

Earlier this week, Linda P. Lay, the wife of former Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth L. Lay, told a national television audience that nearly everything the couple owns is for sale as they struggle with a personal financial crisis. 
But few of the couple's vast real-estate holdings are on the market, according to Multiple Listing Service records.
Altogether, Mr. and Mrs. Lay own real estate valued at more than $30 million in Texas and Colorado, according to local tax records. They own 18 properties in Houston, Galveston, Texas, and Aspen, Colo., according to real-estate records. But only two of the properties, vacation homes in the resort town of Aspen, are being offered for sale. 
On NBC's "Today," Mrs. Lay described the couple's plight in the wake of the Enron bankruptcy as a fight for liquidity because most of their wealth was tied up in Enron stock, now nearly worthless. "Other than the home we live in, everything we own is for sale," she said. 
The comments stirred a torrent of criticism in Houston, where about 4,000 Enron employees have seen their jobs and stock holdings evaporate. Belo Corp.'s Houston television station, KHOU, reported that the couple's Houston and Galveston properties didn't show any sign of being for sale. 
The family's Houston-based investment office didn't return a call requesting clarification. According to tax and real-estate records, the Lays live in a Houston penthouse valued at $7.1 million and continue to hold a home near Aspen's riverfront valued at $4.1 million, as well as property valued at $2.1 million. Two other homes, valued at more than $6.1 million each, were listed with an Aspen real-estate firm on Nov. 12, two weeks before Enron filed for bankruptcy. Mr. Lay also sold a third of his stock in Compaq Computer Corp. at the end of October, two months before resigning from its board. 
However, Mr. Lay has retained significant stock holdings in Compaq, Eli Lilly & Co. and other companies where he once served as a director. Those shares are currently valued at more than $10 million. 
Still, along with Enron, the Lays have seen some investments sour. Through private partnerships, they are the largest individual investors in a struggling Houston online company that has cut its work force four times in the past year. 
The Lays invested between $18 million and $20 million out of the more than $150 million that Questia raised since its inception in 1998, according to people close to the firm. 
Questia sells access to online books to college students for $20 a month. Investors say it has fallen far short of its original goal of recruiting 10% of the 14 million U.S. college students to sign up for its service. 
Last month, Questia cut its work force to just 28 employees from 300 a year ago. A spokesman said recently the job cuts would enable the company to continue operations while it seeks new investors. While Mr. Lay has resigned his seats on the boards of Compaq, Eli Lilly and i2 Technologies, he remains on the board of Questia, according to the company.

Enron Report Ties the Company's Ruin To Executives Who Formed Partnerships
A Wall Street Journal News Roundup

(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

A much-anticipated report on an internal investigation into the collapse of energy company Enron Corp. is expected to point fingers at former and current Enron executives who were behind the questionable partnerships that led to the company's ruin, congressional aides said. 
The report, which may be released as early as this weekend, also is expected to outline the failure of internal controls at the company, the aides said.
The report is already being denounced by some defense lawyers and others caught in the widening probe of Enron's collapse. They are raising questions about conflicts of interest, and they fear the report will deflect blame from Enron's board onto former Enron executives or Arthur Andersen LLP, its former auditor. 
In an interview yesterday, William Powers Jr. -- the University of Texas law school dean who joined Enron's board in October and heads a committee of outside directors that is conducting the investigation -- declined to comment on the report. "We will file the report when it's ready and then we will comment on it," he said. Mr. Powers is scheduled to testify at a congressional hearing into the Enron collapse Tuesday. 
Mr. Powers, chairman of the special committee, had ties to Enron executives and its law firm, Vinson & Elkins, and helped raise millions of dollars from them for the University of Texas, the defense lawyers and other said. Mr. Powers serves on the university Capital Campaign Committee, and Enron has given $3 million to the university, and more than $250,000 to the law school, since Mr. Powers became dean in 1998. In addition, Vinson & Elkins endowed a chair at the law school. 
Critics of the expected report also point out that other Enron directors on the special committee approved the transactions that they are now reviewing. The Wall Street Journal reported Jan. 2 that the board explicitly approved the structure of the partnerships now under scrutiny. 
The company announced the formation of the special committee in the fall, just as the Securities and Exchange Commission initiated an investigation into partnerships used by Enron to move debt off its books. 
The special committee's other two members are Raymond Troubh, a New York financial consultant named to Enron's board in late November; and Herbert S. Winokur, a director since 1985 and chairman and CEO of Capricorn Holdings Inc., a private investment company. Mr. Winokur also was chairman of the board's finance committee, which recommended that the board suspend the company's ethics code so former company treasurer, Andrew Fastow, could run a partnership. 
The committee retained William McLucas, a former SEC enforcement chief who left after 22 years to join the Washington, D.C., law firm of Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering, to advise the committee. Mr. McLucas, 51, was known as a no-nonsense securities cop in the eight years he served as the SEC's top law-enforcement officer. 
Enron has said its dealings with the Fastow partnerships were legal and properly disclosed to investors. According to Enron filings with the SEC, the company did deals involving billions of dollars of assets and Enron stock with entities related to the Fastow partnerships. Internal partnership documents indicate that Mr. Fastow and possibly others made millions of dollars from the partnerships. 
The committee is expected to present the report to Enron's full board of directors, then to the official committee of unsecured creditors in Enron's bankruptcy-court proceeding, according to someone familiar with the process. It will then be filed publicly in federal bankruptcy court in New York. 
Asked when Enron planned to file the report with the court, Martin Bienenstock of Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP, Enron's lead bankruptcy lawyer, said, "We hope next week."

Executive Privilege
Enron's Top Dogs Still Flying Luxury Jets

By Brian Ross  <http://abcnews.go.com/sections/2020/2020/ross_brian_bio.html>
 


Jan. 31 - Enron executives and lawyers appear to be going bankrupt in style, traveling to bankruptcy court hearings in New York in the company's two remaining private jets. 


An Enron spokesperson has confirmed a total of eight corporate jet trips to New York and Washington since the bankruptcy, saying the flights were more efficient than commercial travel. 
A round-trip commercial flight, Houston to New York, could be as little as $365 in coach. According to aviation executives, the same trip on an Enron jet would cost tens of thousands of dollars. 
The Enron executives seen leaving the airport Wednesday used the corporate jet to attend the funeral of J. Clifford Baxter, a former Enron executive who committed suicide on Jan. 25. Enron says that is the only nonbusiness trip since the bankruptcy. 
"Of course I have sympathy for the Baxter family, but for them to use the corporate jets to fly the total corporate entity to any function at this point again seems arrogant," said Rod Jordan, a former employee and chairman of the Severed Enron Employees Coalition. 
Former Employees Outraged 
Laid-off Enron employees, who stood in line today for $1,000 checks from a group collecting donations and returned political contributions, were outraged to hear the luxury jets were still in the air. 
"This is atrocious," said former Enron employee Cindy Cicchetti. "What's wrong with coach? That's what I fly." 
The luxury private jets were part of the Enron culture created by its former chairman and CEO, Kenneth Lay. 
Not only did Lay use his $45 million jet for business, but he regularly used it for strictly personal trips for him and his family, at a cost of $334,000 in the year 2000 alone. 
Months before the bankruptcy, Lay defended the personal trips. When asked what kind of message it sends to the rest of the company, he responded, "Well, I think it gives my senior people something to aspire to." 
Enron says Lay's favorite jet has already been sold, and that the remaining two jets are for sale.

Enron exec concedes he gave poor advice 
Student fund loses most of investment 
Associated Press 
Feb. 1, 2002, 12:43AM
RICHMOND, Va. -- A top Enron Corp. executive has admitted he gave poor advice to students at his alma mater who lost nearly $12,000 in University of Richmond endowment money invested in Enron stock. 
Jeffrey McMahon, who was promoted to president and chief operating officer at Enron this week, said he hadn't foreseen the company's collapse. In an interview with the university's newspaper, however, he acknowledged that he had long been a critic of Enron's use of secretive partnerships, a practice that contributed to the company's downfall. 
McMahon, who graduated from the university in 1982, visited the school Sept. 20 and Oct. 18, meeting with students and giving enthusiastic accounts of his company's prospects even as its stock was slumping. 
On Nov. 2, a student group that manages a small portion of the university's endowment fund bought $12,771 worth of Enron stock. At the time, Enron cost $11.61 a share. In late November, Enron's stock crashed, and when the group sold their investment shares were trading at 83 cents. They got back just $913. 
"The students said he was just so enthusiastic about the company," accounting professor Joe Hoyle told the newspaper, The Collegian. "Why would a guy who had a whole lot of knowledge of Enron's finances go to his alma mater and be so enthusiastic ... when you can just keep your mouth shut?" 
Student fund manager Devin Weisleder told the newspaper, "After listening to him for an hour, you want to go out and drop 10 grand to buy the stock." 
In his copyright interview with The Collegian, McMahon said he was unaware the investment was made on his recommendation, but conceded, "In hindsight, that probably wasn't good advice." 
"The stock suffered a precipitous fall that no one could have expected," he said. "I was running an operating division at the time, responsible for paper and steel. I had little knowledge of the financials of the company," he was quoted as saying. 
McMahon was mentioned in an internal memo, written in August by Sherron Smith Watkins and made public earlier this month, critical of Enron's secretive partnerships. 
"I expressed concerns about partnerships in 1999," McMahon told the newspaper. "(Watkins) was referring (in her memo) to conversations I had internally relating to those concerns and possible conflicts of interest." 
Enron filed for bankruptcy in December and laid off thousands of workers. The filing came after weeks of revelations that executives had concocted complicated partnerships that let Enron keep $500 million in debt off its books. Enron shares spiraled to less than a dollar from nearly $80 a year ago, obliterating employees' retirement funds loaded with the stock.

Mighty J.P. Morgan in the Hot Seat Banking: Charges of collusion with Enron and its recent hefty losses raise questions about firm's judgment.

TIMES STAFF WRITER

In the rubble of recent financial collapses, one prestigious institution seems especially vulnerable: J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., the nation's second-largest bank. 
The New York company, a lead lender to Enron Corp., Kmart Corp. and telecommunications firm Global Crossing Ltd., is at risk of losing billions in dealings with bankrupt firms, as well as losing heavily in Argentina's economic meltdown.
J.P. Morgan also lost $1.1 billion last year on its stakes in businesses, including many ailing technology companies, and is accused by insurers of helping Enron conceal vast losses. Morgan strongly disputes the charge, but the allegation, coupled with the hefty losses, raises questions about the judgment of an institution that traces its roots back more than 200 years. 
The bank's woes, accompanied by sizable losses on loans at many other financial giants, also reveal chinks in a banking industry generally regarded as a pillar for the nation's recovery from an economic slowdown and from Sept. 11. 
J.P. Morgan fares badly in comparison with big competitors such as Citigroup Inc., the largest U.S. banking concern, and Bank of America Inc., the third-largest. Despite their huge losses in Argentina, Enron and other corporate collapses, Citigroup earned $4 billion and BofA posted a profit of $2 billion in the fourth quarter, bolstered in part by robust consumer lending. 
Morgan, by contrast, lost $332million in the fourth quarter, compared with a $708-million profit a year earlier. For the year, the company still earned $1.6 billion. 
Wall Street's skittishness over projected losses at J.P. Morgan has been apparent in the steady stock sell-off in recent weeks after a "continuing parade of train wrecks," in the words of analyst E. Reilly Tierney at Fox-Pitt Kelton in New York. 
The stock, which traded above $40 early in December, hovered near $32 this week before closing Thursday at $34.05, up 99 cents a share, on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Some analysts remain bullish on Morgan, saying the institution is fundamentally sound and the financial setbacks are only temporary. And by some industry measures, J.P. Morgan's financials look sturdy. A key ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets, for example, was just 0.87% as of Dec. 31, well below the 2% figure regarded as a sign of potential trouble. 
Investors' concerns surfaced in December after Enron's bankruptcy, when J.P. Morgan, which had a reputation for usually disclosing bad news promptly and completely, suddenly tripled its estimate of its potential Enron losses, to $2.6 billion. 
Nearly $1 billion of the total stemmed from insurers' refusals to pay Enron-related claims on unfulfilled energy contracts. The insurers contended in a lawsuit filed in federal court in New York that the losses resulted from J.P. Morgan's setting up "sham" offshore energy trading concerns to do business with Enron. 
J.P. Morgan contends its energy trading companies were above board, adding that--unlike Enron--it included the results on its balance sheets. 
The bank also says the hefty loan losses from the mammoth bankruptcies are a result of J.P. Morgan's position as the leading arranger of the biggest credit lines to the biggest businesses. These so-called syndicated loans are carved up and shared by dozens of banks. 
"We're handling 40% of the syndicated loans, and when companies go down we tend to be exposed," said J.P. Morgan spokeswoman Kristin Lemkau. 
But other banks in the syndicates typically take on responsibility for more than 90% of the amounts lent. Though J.P. Morgan arranged $1.6 billion in credit lines for Kmart, for example, it had just $117 million in unsecured loans when the retailer filed for bankruptcy last month. Likewise, though J.P. Morgan had helped arrange $2.25 billion in loans for Global Crossing, it's now owed less than $100 million by the telecom firm, according to people close to the situation. And while J.P. Morgan still has a $500-million exposure to Argentina, Citigroup and FleetBoston have far more. 
Indeed, only about 10% of J.P. Morgan's earnings come from lending these days, compared with 50% a decade ago, Lemkau said, meaning its comparative credit risk exposure actually has declined dramatically. 
Still, there's no denying the bank's missteps, which include an 8% stake in an Argentine bank accused of fraud, and loans to a European cable TV company that has threatened to default on $17.5 billion in debt. 
Prospects looked far brighter at the end of 2000, when J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. emerged in its current manifestation via the colossal merger of Chase Manhattan Corp. and J.P. Morgan & Co. 
After deregulation tore down walls separating banks, brokerages and insurers, the idea was to compete better with Citigroup--itself formed in the merger of Citicorp and Travelers Group--by selling more services to clients. The newly formed giant hoped especially to persuade companies with bank loans to use J.P. Morgan's investment banking services, which typically are more profitable than commercial lending. 
But the technology meltdown, the recession and Sept. 11 combined to create the worst environment in years for stock offerings, mergers and other staples of investment banking. 
The big question now, Tierney said, is whether J.P. Morgan failed to assess credit risks properly at companies because it figured making loans was a sure path to bigger profit on other services. 
However, Lemkau said the dollar amount of corporate loans on J.P. Morgan's books has declined for the last three years. "It's a misconception we're lending like a drunken sailor so we can get our hand on more profitable businesses," she said. "It's just not true." 
No doubt reflecting the uncertainties facing all financial institutions after Sept. 11 and the Enron meltdown, the range of expert opinions about Morgan is astonishingly wide. 
Some analysts, such as Michael Mayo at Prudential Financial, have slapped "sell" ratings on the bank while others, such as Diana P. Yates at A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc., rate it a "strong buy." 
Yates characterized concerns over the insurers' allegations of collusion with Enron as "overdone." She also warned against judging J.P. Morgan by its admittedly atrocious last quarter. 
"They're taking some hits, but they're a big company with a $41-billion equity base. It's not like they're going out of business," she said.

Enron Bondholders Blame Brokers
By Jathon Sapsford
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

Citigroup Inc. lent money to Enron Corp. in October, when the energy company's finances were sliding. At the same time, the Wall Street giant pitched Enron bonds to clients as a solid investment. 
Now, at least one institutional investor who bought the bonds is hopping mad -- and has taken the beef to court.
In a suit filed recently in federal court in New York, Silvercreek Management Inc., a Toronto investment company that bought Enron bonds in October, accuses Citigroup's Salomon Smith Barney unit, as well as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Bank of America Corp.'s Banc of America Securities LLC, of promoting Enron securities even when they knew the company was on the brink of collapse. 
"The brokers were calling our clients telling them that this was a wonderful opportunity to buy these instruments," says Joe Cotchett, a lawyer representing Silvercreek. "They were giving our client a sell job." 
Citigroup, Goldman and Banc of America declined to comment. 
The suit is one of the first to put the blame for Enron squarely on Wall Street's role in facilitating Enron's deception. "Enron's investment bankers sold the securities which propped up the pyramid," the suit alleges. "In the process, these firms earned $214 million in underwriting fees alone, and much more for lending, derivatives trading and merger advice." 
But the case highlights a broader question. Did Enron's lenders have a duty to their investing clients to disclose the depths of Enron's woes? Some analysts say that investors should probably have known that they were buying securities from financial institutions who were in a position to know that Enron was facing dire straits. Yet Citigroup wouldn't have to disclose its knowledge of Enron's troubles because of lender confidentiality. 
"When you're a bank lender, you can hide behind the confidentiality rule," says David Hendler, an analyst at market research firm CreditSights. 
In its suit, Silvercreek says the three financial firms were pitching Enron securities to Silvercreek as late as October, including some new bonds that would convert into Enron stock. The Canadian firm, which invested $175 million in Enron bonds in October, says it lost $120 million and is seeking compensation and unspecified damages. 
Sure, Enron had been through a rough patch over the summer, the Wall Street sales pitch went, according to Silvercreek's lawyers. But Enron wasn't all that bad off, and the bonds were selling at a sharp discount. That purported pitch was mirrored by some of the research reports the brokerage firms had released during October. 
"We reiterate our Buy rating on Enron," an Oct. 19 Salomon Smith Barney report on Enron said, "after untangling part of a complicated story involving their balance sheet." 
Enron's story, of course, wasn't nearly so upbeat. Its balance-sheet high jinks caused a sudden loss of confidence, bringing about a liquidity shortage so dire that Enron was forced to draw down an emergency $3 billion credit line on Oct. 25, only a few days after Salomon's report. That move signaled Enron was running short of crucial operating capital. 
Citigroup's lending division knew as well as anybody that Enron was facing trouble, since it had been one of the top banks arranging the credit line. Yet the brokerage companies had Enron securities in their firm's inventory to unload, according to the Silvercreek suit. 
Enron had sold Wall Street firms about $1.9 billion in convertible bonds that firms such as Citigroup were free to sell to investors by June of 2001, the court papers say. But the sales of these securities weren't going so well, Silvercreek alleges. 
So Citigroup's brokers became increasingly aggressive in pushing the Enron bonds on institutional investors, Silvercreek's lawyers say. Citigroup sold Silvercreek its last chunk of Enron securities on Oct. 25 -- the same day that Enron drew down its credit line from Citigroup. 
Executives familiar with Citigroup thinking assert that Silvercreek should have known the risks of investing in Enron as well as any other investor. Meanwhile, the lending side knew about the problems at Enron, but the brokerage side didn't. That is in keeping with the so-called Chinese Wall on Wall Street, which seeks to separate businesses to reduce conflicts. 
Further complicating the role of Citigroup in the dispute is that on Oct. 25 -- the same day Enron drew down its credit line -- Citigroup met with other bankers to begin discussions on a new, $1 billion Enron credit line. 
The new financing, which was announced much later, was firmly secured by collateral in the form of Enron pipeline assets. Yet Citigroup effectively rolled some of its existing unsecured Enron financing into the new secured credit line -- thereby shielding itself from Enron losses shortly after pushing Enron debt on to other investors.

FERC to focus on Enron's role in Calif. energy crisis 
Bush appointed 2 Lay choices to commission 
By PATTY REINERT 
Copyright 2002 Houston Chronicle Washington Bureau 
Feb. 1, 2002, 12:21AM
WASHINGTON -- Federal energy regulators Thursday launched an investigation into whether Houston's embattled Enron Corp. helped prolong last year's electricity crisis in California by unfairly manipulating wholesale power prices. 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Chairman Pat Wood III, a Texas Republican who was appointed by President Bush last year at the behest of Enron Chairman Ken Lay, confirmed that an inquiry had begun but declined to elaborate on its scope. 
FERC spokeswoman Barbara Connors said Wood's decision to look into Enron's activities came at the request of several Western Democratic lawmakers, including Sens. Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein of California, Ron Wyden of Oregon and Maria Cantwell of Washington. California Gov. Gray Davis, a longtime Enron critic, also requested an investigation. 
Calls for FERC to look into Enron's business dealings in California came as early as 2000 as power prices soared after the state's failed attempt to deregulate its energy markets. But pressure on federal energy regulators has mounted in the past month amid investigations by numerous congressional committees, the Labor Department, Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department. 
Enron officials did not return calls seeking comment on the latest investigation, but the company has denied any wrongdoing in the California energy crisis. 
Boxer cited a 30-minute meeting that Lay, who since has left Enron, had with Vice President Dick Cheney on April 17 to discuss the California crisis. The senator said a memo from that meeting offers possible evidence that Enron officials, who were huge financial contributors to the Bush presidential campaign, influenced the administration's energy policies. 
The eight-point memo that Lay reportedly gave Cheney during their meeting was published earlier this week by the San Francisco Chronicle. 
In it, Lay suggested that the administration "reject any attempt to re-regulate wholesale power markets by adopting price caps or returning to archaic methods of determining the cost base of wholesale power." 
He added that even temporary price caps would be detrimental to power markets. 
The day after his meeting with Lay, Cheney said price caps wouldn't solve California's problems. 
Boxer called the revelations "quite disturbing" and said they raise questions about whether Enron also may have tried to influence FERC directly. 
In addition to an investigation of Enron, Boxer requested information on meetings and phone calls between Enron executives and FERC commissioners and staff between August 2000 and June 2001. 
The FERC investigation comes one day after the General Accounting Office said it would take the unprecedented step of suing the White House in the next few weeks unless Cheney reconsiders his refusal to turn over information on meetings between Enron and other energy executives and the administration's energy task force. 
Meanwhile, in an interview scheduled for broadcast tonight on PBS' Now With Bill Moyers, Lay says that during a meeting at the White House he gave Bush administration officials a list of candidates for seats on the five-member FERC. Of the eight names, Bush appointed two -- Wood and Nora Brownell of Pennsylvania. 
"I brought a list, we certainly presented a list. ... As I recall, I signed a letter which in fact had some recommendations as to people that we thought would be good commissioners," Lay said in the interview, which was taped last May but never aired. 
White House spokeswoman Anne Womack confirmed Thursday that Lay gave the names to Clay Johnson, Bush's personnel director. 
Wood, who served as head of the Texas Public Utility Commission under then-Gov. George W. Bush, is an advocate of market-oriented utility regulation, an approach favored by Lay and other Enron officials. 
Bush selected Wood for the FERC job to replace Curt Hebert, who says in tonight's PBS program that he and Lay had long disagreed about issues before the commission. Lay had "asked me to take certain positions, but I've had those conversations with Ken Lay for a long time -- and have disagreed with him for a long time," said Hebert, a former Mississippi legislator. 
Enron, once the world's largest energy trader, plunged into bankruptcy Dec. 2 after admitting it had overstated its profits by $586 million since 1997. 
Lay is scheduled to testify before Congress next week as part of numerous inquiries launched in the wake of Enron's collapse. Information yielded by congressional investigators so far has rekindled the ire of officials in Western states who have long claimed Enron was at least partly to blame for the region's energy woes almost two years ago. 
"If there is any doubt in your mind about whether an investigation is warranted, the latest revelations should answer that question," Davis wrote to Wood in a letter released Thursday. "Clearly, an investigation is needed." 
Davis, a Democrat, first called on FERC to investigate allegations of market manipulation by Enron and other power generators and traders in the summer of 2000. 
By fall of that year, wholesale power prices in California had risen tenfold and continued at high levels through the following spring as angry customers began to suffer through blackouts. 
The price jump was blamed on the state's failed attempt at deregulating electricity markets. 
FERC eventually voted to impose price caps on electricity sold in California. That move, along with the state's signing long-term contracts with power companies to lock in prices and milder weather that spring, ended the crisis. 
Blaming Enron and other marketers for the crisis, the state of California has sought $9 billion in refunds for alleged overcharges. That case is pending before a FERC administrative judge; no decision is expected for several months. 

Economy
Bush to Unveil Proposals for Changing Pension Law
By Jeanne Cummings and Kathy Chen

WASHINGTON -- Workers would have more flexibility to diversify retirement accounts, senior executives would be held to the same blackout periods on stock sales as rank-and-file employees, and workers could receive more independent investment advice under pension proposals to be unveiled by President Bush today. 
Based on the recommendations of a cabinet task force, Mr. Bush is expected to announce those changes and others during an appearance before congressional Republicans at the Greenbrier resort in West Virginia, a senior White House official said.
The proposals stem from a three-week review of pension law commissioned by the president in response to the collapse of Enron Corp. As the Houston energy-trading company spiraled toward its Dec. 2 bankruptcy, workers' retirement savings that were bottled up in frozen 401(k) accounts evaporated with the shrinking stock price. Some senior executives, whose holdings weren't under the same restrictions, sold off millions of dollars in stock and cashed in deferred compensation accounts. 
The White House study, conducted by Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill, Labor Secretary Elaine Chao, and Commerce Secretary Donald Evans, was designed to provide greater protection for workers in the future and to give the president some political cover in the scandal that involves one of his largest financial backers. 
The proposal, which would require legislation or regulatory action before taking effect, doesn't go as far as some bills supported by consumer and labor organizations. But some provisions are likely to meet resistance from businesses. 
To give employees greater flexibility to diversify their portfolios, employers would be required to allow workers to sell employer-company stock after they have participated in their 401(k) plans for three years. Many employers currently require workers to hold on to company shares, especially those that are given by the employer as a "match" to employee contributions, for many years, or even until retirement. Employers enjoy tax benefits for issuing company stock to retirement accounts, and the practice is also cheaper than making cash retirement contributions. But, in the case of a bankruptcy such as Enron's, the restrictions can wipe out employee nest eggs, advocates of change argue. 
The president's package wouldn't limit the amount of employer-company stock that could be held in 401(k) plans. Such caps have been proposed in legislation, including a bill introduced by Democratic Sens. Barbara Boxer of California and Jon Corzine of New Jersey that is supported by consumer and labor groups. 
Calling for increased access to investment advice, Mr. Bush embraced a bill sponsored by Rep. John Boehner (R., Ohio) and passed by the House last year. The White House now will push for action in the Senate. 
The Boehner bill would encourage employers to provide more investment advice to their workers by shielding them from lawsuits and fiduciary responsibility for investment decisions made based on advice given by other parties. But the bill also would allow pension-plan managers to provide such advice, a move which consumer groups say would result in a dangerous conflict of interest. 
The National Association of Manufacturers, which is leading a coalition to oppose major pension changes, and other industry groups have voiced support for Mr. Boehner's bill. 
Mr. Bush's proposals also would raise the stakes for employers when they impose "blackout periods" on stock trading for pension plans. Companies routinely impose such periods when they are changing plan administrators, for instance. 
In addition to requiring senior executives to face the same blackout periods as lower-level workers, Mr. Bush is calling for a 30-day notice before a blackout begins. He also will recommend that employers be held responsible for what happens to workers' investments during the periods when their stock is frozen. Under current regulations, employers are protected from that liability.

Who Were the Friends of Enron?: Michael Lewis
2002-01-31 16:25 (New York)

    Berkeley, California, Jan. 31 (Bloomberg) -- The only people who are going to explain what happened at Enron Corp., and why, are the people who worked there. So I'm delighted to report the trickle of notes and letters from Old Enronians has become a torrent. My inbox runneth over.
     This week's pile of cards and letters offers several different kinds of information. The first is the sort of colorful detail that will be useful to whoever eventually makes the crummy TV movie about the energy trader's collapse.
     It's fun to know, for instance, that Enron's chief risk officer had a picture of the Titanic on the wall of his office, and that Enron's chief accountant drove a Ferrari. It's even more fun to know there was plenty of sexual scandal in the halls at Enron, to go along with the financial one. Office affairs are common at any big company, but Enron's steamy Texas culture seems to have created a particularly juicy hothouse.

Book Fodder

     The next category of information is the deeper understanding that will be useful to whoever writes the respectable best-selling book about Enron.
     For the first time since the scandal broke, for example, I've read a satisfying explanation for Enron's many disastrous investments in foreign assets.
     As this correspondent put it, the main motive for paying ridiculously big sums for Indian power plants and Brazilian pipelines and so on was not foreign market information, or access to foreign politicians, but the need to be able to cover a short position.
     In its attempt to create the same sort of trading markets in developing countries as it had in the U.S., Enron exposed itself to a new kind of market risk.
     It was one thing to be caught short in U.S. natural gas, in which you could hedge your position on a well-established futures exchange. It was another to be caught short Indian electricity. Owning the underlying physical assets ensured that would never happen. (But also ensured Enron would be constitutionally long all new markets.)

Friends and FOEs

     The final category of information is the sort of corporate intrigue that will be gold to the investigative reporters newly assigned to the Enron beat.
     For example, there was, according to one former Enron employee, a group of individual investors known as the Friends of Enron.
     These people, ironically known as FOEs, were offered the following deal: Agree to put your name on a million dollar investment in a private offshore partnership stuffed to the gills with junky assets, and Enron would lend 95 percent of the money and guarantee you at least a 15 percent annual return. In other words, put up fifty grand and Enron would ensure you received 150 grand at the end of the year.
     So, who was offered this deal? My Enron correspondent contends the list of people on it will read "like a Who's Who.''
     Bloomberg News this week revealed that some individuals who put money into Enron partnerships run by former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow were executives at Merrill Lynch & Co.
     This is interesting -- and not merely because of the blatant conflict of interest in employees of a firm taking huge sums of money from Enron when it is the role of their firm, in part, to serve as a detached observer of Enron. The conceit that Wall Street firms evaluate U.S. companies honestly was dropped long ago. (Merrill is a passive minority investor in Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News, and has said the investments didn't represent a conflict of interest.)

Looking the Other Way

     No, what's astonishing is that the people who were offered these deals by Enron didn't acknowledge what they said about a company that last year ranked as the seventh largest in the U.S. by sales. A lot of well placed people knew such a giant company was rotten and yet no one said anything about it, or altered his behavior in any way towards the company.
    Or almost no one. A couple of local Houston institutional investors who declined similar sweet deals could see clearly enough what it meant.
     Danny Bowers, the chief investment officer of the Houston Fireman's Relief and Retirement Fund, has said "there was a pretty blatant conflict of interest. It was kind of a stinky deal.''
     David Long, who runs the Houston Municipal Employees Pension Fund, told Bloomberg News that, "We had a lot of discussion about potential conflicts of interest. You had the CFO of Enron, who's an employee of Enron, acting as general partner of a partnership which for the most part could be construed to be adversarial to Enron.''

Need Not to Know

     So why didn't any respectable person respond the same way to Enron's offer of free money?
     One of the curious aspects of the Enron scandal is the way the world configured itself so that it didn't need to know the truth about the company. There was a need, both financial and psychological, not to know.
     Now we know the partnership structure was an open secret on Wall Street. There was a lot of money to be made on the short side by a Wall Street person if he leaked Enron's moral infrastructure to, say, the Wall Street Journal. But, at least as far as we know, no one at Merrill did this.
     So, who else was offered a sweet deal by Enron and yet failed to be shocked or alarmed? Anyone currently residing in Washington? I await your cards and letters.

Houston, we have a problem
The city where deregulation is king is in Enron denial - and won't let go of its wildcatting ways.
- - - - - - - - - - - -
By Katharine Mieszkowski, Salon.com
Feb. 1, 2002 | HOUSTON -- In a skyscraper just across the street from Enron's sparkly new downtown headquarters, Pamela Lovett explains why the biggest bankruptcy in history isn't something to get all worked up about. "This is not the first company to declare bankruptcy," she says. "Personally, I have very high regard for Ken Lay." 
Lovett is the head of economic development for the Greater Houston Partnership, a local business group with 135 CEO members, which Lay was the chairman of in 1994. Her job is wooing big companies to come set up shop in the laissez-faire, pro-business Promised Land of Houston. 
She lowers her voice to remind me reverently that in this country we assume the accused are "innocent until proven otherwise," and when it comes to Enron "a lot of things are being tried by speculation." But the civics lesson is interrupted when Lovett's colleague David McCollum comes bursting in to announce that the FBI has just occupied Enron's headquarters, based on reports that employees were still shredding documents there a few days earlier. 
"We're just having so much fun now!" McCollum jokes before popping back out, leaving Lovett to continue to argue that in spite of the Enron collapse things here in Houston are just fine, thanks. 
Congress is holding hearings, criminal investigations are under way and class action suits are bubbling over, but in Houston, civic leaders don't want to jump to any untoward conclusions. Despite all the sob stories generated by thousands of local laid-off Enron workers and retirees, Mayor Lee Brown has been careful not to cast blame. When Ken Lay resigned as the CEO of Enron, the mayor said in a statement: "Only those who are working all day, every day on this situation are in a position to know all the details." Oh, and by the way, Lay sponsored a $50,000 fundraiser for Brown's election last year. 
The Houston City Council isn't exactly warming up the tar-and-feathers either. Instead, it's busy awarding a $198,000 consulting contract to Arthur Andersen, a company now feverishly attempting to escape its own immolation after its failure to competently audit Enron's books. "That disgusted me," says Amy Oberg, a former Enron employee who lost retirement savings in her 401K as well as her job. "The fact that the city went and did that in the middle of the federal investigation just blows my mind. For the people here who were hurt by Enron, that was a slap in the face." 
Greetings from Houston, the city that tries too hard. Houston is a city that is proudly unapologetic about its status as an icon of anything-goes deregulation. Nowhere will you find a place more consciously devoted to living the free-market version of the American dream. But there's an insecurity lurking beneath the pride, an inferiority complex bred in part by the spectacular flameouts and huge busts that are a natural consequence of living with as few rules as possible. It is, as one resident notes, a place where "people come to make money, and then they go someplace else. Nobody retires in Houston." 
Enron's fall from grace is but the most recent disaster to bring out the contradictions inherent in the Houston way. Even as many Houstonians feel a lingering sense of betrayal and disappointment and no shortage of embarrassment, they are still unwilling to ask themselves: Why did Enron happen here in Houston? And can anything be done to prevent the next catastrophe? 
Probably not. Because to do anything substantive would be a betrayal of Houston's founding myth -- the idea that the city is a place where a guy can come to make a lot of money without being held back by a bunch of party-pooping naysayers and regulators. It's a myth that fits neatly into the explicit deregulation platform so heavily promoted by Ken Lay and Enron, and it's not something that Houstonians will give up on easily. 
"There will be no reform in Houston," predicts Dr. Alvin Tarlov, a physician and policy advisor at the Baker Institute for Public Policy in Houston. 
There never is. 
"This is a city where you can make your fortune and not have people looking over your shoulder saying: 'You can't do that,'" says Houston native Carlos Hernandez, with evident pride, adding quickly: "Enron was taking that to the extreme. That's just criminal." 
But from the beginning, Houston's wide-open ethos has been an invitation to criminals. "Houston is a city that started as a land scam. It's still a wildcatters town," says Jim Hightower, the Texas writer and wisecracker. Back in the 1820s the city's roguish developers sold scrip for 5 or 10 cents an acre that didn't actually convey property rights to any land. It was a scam that makes pushing stock that's not based on real revenues look pretty tame. 
To this day, locals eschew government oversight so much that many suburbanites here don't even live under any city government. They inhabit unincorporated districts run by the residents, in a barely governed super-sprawl of cheap housing. Here's how it works: A developer buys a piece of the endless raw prairie land outside city limits. He puts a trailer on it and has his construction foreman move in. Then, an only-in-Texas "election" is held. The sole voter -- the construction foreman -- votes in favor of developing the property, and voila! -- a new district is created complete with tax-exempt bond status. 
When the new 'burb is built and inhabited, the developer turns it over to the citizens, who repay the debt from the bonds with property taxes. There are some 400 of these unincorporated districts in the Greater Houston area, and you only really hear about them when the City of Houston cherry-picks a wealthy one, annexing it to assume its lucrative tax base -- usually against vehement "Don't tread on me!" protests from the residents. 
In the unincorporated areas and the city proper that together make up the sprawling greater Houston area, population 4.5 million, lies a case study in what is wrought by living according to the commandment "There shall be no zoning." Sublime, helter-skelter juxtapositions are everywhere. Right next to an eight-lane freeway, a Discount tire store huddles near a traveling carnival; children spin themselves silly on blinking rides that rival NASA's anti-gravity chambers, under the vacant gaze of an overly made-up model looming down from a billboard advertising an all-night porn store. And don't miss the 20-story office building right across the street from a neighborhood of brand-new monster houses, with no niceties like landscaping buffering the commercial district from the residential one. Neighborhood deed restrictions impose some conformity, but those rules end at the property lines -- then, hallelujah! Anything goes! There were a few years there in the early '90s when the Houston City Council did impose zoning, albeit after the fact, but by 1994 the citizens had voted to repeal this brazen act of government intervention. 
"Strip malls and strip clubs. There's a Gap on every corner next to a Starbucks," says Tracy Delmer, a speech pathologist who has lived here all her life. "It's all about trying to make your strip mall prettier than the other strip mall down the street." 
The flip side to freedom from nasty government oversight is some of the worst air pollution in the country. Some 2.5 percent of the world's total refining capacity lies in the greater Houston area, and Houston's high ozone readings are rivaled only by Los Angeles. The state, in true Texas laissez-faire style, has been notoriously lax on environmental regulation, allowing old petrochemical plants to be grandfathered in when introducing new, watered down environmental rules, which just means that those old, polluting plants never seem to die off. 
"That's Texas. If the federal government forces Texas to do it, they do it," says Jim Blackburn, a Houston environmental lawyer. "But otherwise, it's all up for grabs." 
Is it any wonder that few people seem to come here just for fun? "People don't say 'I went to Houston last summer,'" says Delmer, "like they say 'I went to Seattle.'" 
"All over the country, if people hear they're being transferred to Houston they want to commit suicide," says Amy Jaffe, a local energy policy advisor, who still finds the distaste outsiders have for Houston puzzling. It's not as if Houston is some kind of cultural wasteland, she notes, enumerating a laundry list of Houston's sophisticated worldly charms, from the opera to the ballet to the symphony. 
All of which, it should be noted, are funded almost entirely by private sources. 
Nationally, Enron's demise is stirring debate on a huge range of issues, from campaign finance reform to accounting rules to the very ascendancy of the idea of deregulation. 
But not here in Houston. 
"None of us blame President Bush or free-market capitalism for Enron's collapse," says Raymund Eich, a local patent agent, who believes that liberals are using the Enron bankruptcy as an excuse to smear both. Only Dallas and Washington gave more money to Bush's 2000 campaign than Houston, and Enron is well known to be Bush's single biggest corporate backer, but Eich doesn't think the government owes anything to hard-hit Enron employees or investors, noting that "Houstonians are more self-reliant than people in other places." 
Take Houston accountants -- a phrase that in February 2002 sounds like the punchline to a very bad joke waiting to happen. Here's a group who would like very much to remain self-reliant, even as they fear that their days of self-regulation may be numbered, thanks to Andersen's bad behavior. Over lunch -- beef stew on noodles -- the members of the Houston Chapter of the Texas Society of Certified Public Accountants at their annual business meeting at the J.K. Marriott dish about Andersen's role in the Enron debacle. 
"I think someone should pay," says Ann-Marie Curtin, a CPA at Prime Asset Management, a Houston property company. "There's no way that there wasn't a significant amount of illegal activity going on." 
But new rules to help prevent such nefarious activities? They won't hear of it. Patrick L. Durio, president-elect of the local group and the chairman of the -- voluntary! -- ethics committee of the Texas Society of CPAs, says: "Government regulation is not the answer. I don't want to see the government setting accounting standards," noting that the industry has been self-regulating for 100 years. "And I don't think that politicians should be getting involved in it." 
In Houston, they probably won't. Because no matter how big Enron's corporate implosion appears on the national scale, such colossal busts are hardly unusual in Houston history. In fact, Enron is a mere blip compared to the city-wide bust that occurred in the mid-'80s. Houston is always trying to shake the perception that it's just an urban pit stop for roughnecks who rip natural resources out of the ground on the way to getting really, really rich. Because many Houstonians remember what happened when those roughnecks and their moneymen ran the town right into the ground. 
"Imagine a city where everybody had gone to Las Vegas for the weekend and lost everything they owned," says Jaffe. 
In the mid-'80s, the city lost a quarter of a million jobs in the oil and real estate bust. "There were a lot of people who went from owning lots of real estate in West Houston and driving a Porsche to having to take a job selling aluminum siding. Everybody was a kazillionaire," says Jaffe, "and all of a sudden, everybody was bankrupt over the course of, like, three years." Banks just couldn't keep up with all the foreclosures on the suburban houses stocked with '80s amenities -- the backyard swimming pool, the built-in wet bar and the Jacuzzi. 
The bust inspired a favorite Houston bumper-sticker, begging God for a second chance, for another oil boom: "God, if you bring it again, we won't screw it up this time." 
Things were so depressed circa 1986 that a volunteer civic organization called Houston Proud formed to try to cheer up the beleaguered populace. The Houston Proud theme song was a relentlessly upbeat ditty that tried too hard. Sample lyric: "We're Houston Proud! Proud of the things we've done together!" Commercials aired on local TV pairing the song with chipper images of smiling Houstonians to market Houston to its own people, as if to plead, "Please don't lose faith. Just don't move away." 
And maybe that's where the inferiority complex comes from: This is a city that knows what it feels like to fall flat on your face, to go from driving a Porsche to selling aluminum siding. Or maybe a city where the free-market conquers all knows it's inevitably a little rough around the edges. 
Congratulations, Houston! You've just been named "The Fattest City in America" by Men's Fitness magazine for the second year in a row. To respond to the salvo, Mayor Brown recently launched a campaign to inspire Houstonians to slim down, by starting with his own waistline. If you can't rule by policy, why not govern by example? 
The taxes are so low here that the city government needs a public referendum to do anything beyond barely keeping the surface streets functional. Behind the scenes, it's businesspeople, both informally and through the Greater Houston Partnership, who push civic projects and sweetheart deals along, from downtown revitalization to building new stadiums. In Houston, the business agenda is the civic agenda. 
"The shadow government decided where the football stadium is going to be, how much public money was going to be put into it, and where the money would come from," explains Tarlov. Ken Lay led the approval process of the new baseball stadium, which now bears the name of his disgraced company. 
The sign that says Enron Field, which the now-bankrupt company pledged to pay $100 million for, is the most vivid symbol that Enron's shame is also a big black eye for Houston. But neither Enron Field nor the Compaq Center -- Compaq cut 8,500 jobs last spring and may still be absorbed by Hewlett-Packard -- has soured local politicians on the naming game. Right now, the City Council is considering selling off different rooms of the new convention center for corporate branding. 
Houston has struggled since the catastrophic oil bust of the '80s to change its wildcatting ways. And like an investor who learned her lesson the hard way when her 401K turned out to be composed 80 percent of Enron stock, Houston has shed its overdependence on the energy industry, with some success. The city now boasts that while 82 percent of all economic activity in the early '80s was energy-related, now it's about 49 percent. That still means it's a town whose fortunes are tied to the price of oil, just less so. 
But even with big local employers Compaq and Continental on the ropes, Enron evaporating and the price of oil down from $30 a barrel in early 2000 to $18 a barrel today, the city has lost only 5,700 seasonably adjusted jobs, according to the University of Houston's Institute for Regional Forecasting. That means while the country has shed about 1 percent of its job base in the recession, even with Enron's fall, Houston has lost only a quarter percent of its base. Houston may be down, but it is still ahead of the rest of the country. 
But the collapse of Enron means something more here than the loss of jobs or money or even face. Lay was the archetypal Good Houston Businessman: a young man from somewhere else who comes to town, makes a lot of money and showers it back on the community, while building his good name. He was widely thought to be a promising candidate for mayor when Brown's term expires on term limits next year, prompting comparisons to Houston's great-granddaddy of civic business leaders, Jesse "Mr. Houston" Jones. 
And before its collapse, Enron represented Houston's best idea of itself -- an innovative, technocratic, deregulation innovator that might be a bit on the arrogant and greedy side but was also philanthropic and civic-minded, a company transforming itself out of the oil and gas business into a new economy conglomerate that even sold broadband services. Enron was the New Houston. 
Not even the city's official civic pride cheerleaders can entirely brush off Enron. Lynn Nutt, chair of Houston Proud, confides: "The self-esteem here in Houston is very depleted." 
But in a city that's always trying to prove itself, there's no time for navel-gazing about whether Enron's collapse means that there's something inherent in Houston's culture that breeds such colossal screwups. The Houston way isn't to wallow and whine. It's to declare -- all together now! -- your pride in your city, while leaving the congressional investigators, the FBI and the courts to sort out that Enron mess. In bike-riding, eco-friendly, granola-eating Portland, Ore., they may be singing the "Enron Blues," but here in Houston, headquarters for the largest bankruptcy in history, they're still Houston Proud! 
Just in time for all the Enron fuss, there's a new Houston Proud "Rally Song" by local songwriter Phil Blackman: "Houston is the Place to Be." It's a twangy Texas two-step blues number with a country twist. 
"I've been up, I've been down, 
Searchin' for a place to be 
I've been around, the world you see 
But Houston is the place for me." 
Ah, the good-natured earnestness, the protesting-too-much! It's enough to make the heart skip a beat for Houston, or maybe just make you want to skip town.

Texas law firm working to weather Enron storm
Vinson & Elkins, one of state's largest firms, faces hard questions on its work for company
By Bruce Hight
American-Statesman Staff
Friday, February 1, 2002
For now, at least, Vinson & Elkins LLP, the big Houston law firm that represented Enron Corp., sits quietly in the eye of the hurricane of outrage that stormed the city after the collapse of the energy giant into bankruptcy and scandal.
But the investigations have only begun.
So far, the firm says, it has not lost any clients and even continues to represent Enron on some matters, although it says Enron owes the firm $5 million for past services.
And while Vinson & Elkins faces questions about its role in the creation and operation of the partnerships that contributed to Enron's failure, the firm - one of the largest in the state - has not been directly implicated in Enron's collapse.
That's a marked contrast to Arthur Andersen LLP, which was fired as Enron's auditor last month and has fired one of its own top partners. It has also acknowledged destroying Enron-related records and admitted this week that it has lost clients. Some analysts have suggested that Andersen might be so heavily damaged that it will have to seek a merger with another accounting firm.
Harry Reasoner, who was Vinson & Elkins' managing partner until the end of last year, said the law firm is not free to comment in detail about its work for Enron because of attorney-client privilege.
"It is particularly frustrating because we're confident that when the full facts come out that it will be clear that we have conducted ourselves in a manner that is both professional and is required by our ethical obligations," he said.
One aspect of the firm's work for Enron already has raised eyebrows: At Enron's request, it investigated internal warnings last fall of possible wrongdoing involving some of the partnerships that eventually led to the company's bankruptcy, despite a warning that Vinson & Elkins had previously provided some legal advice pertaining to the partnerships.
Outside legal experts agree that it's too soon to tell whether the firm acted legally and ethically. But that doesn't mean it has nothing to worry about, they added.
"Even if Vinson & Elkins is determined to have no legal liability in this matter, its reputation has been tarnished," said Milton "Mitt" Regan, who teaches a course on professional responsibility and corporate lawyers at Georgetown University Law Center in Washington.
One issue, Regan said, is just what role Vinson & Elkins played in the creation of the partnerships that were used by Enron to move debt off its own books, which apparently benefited some Enron executives and helped lead to bankruptcy.
"We will need to know whether Vinson & Elkins was confined to the narrow task of opining on the legality of business proposals that others developed, or whether it took a more expansive role as a member of the team that developed business strategies," Regan said in an e-mail interview.
John Dzienkowski, a University of Texas law professor who also teaches professional responsibility, said even if Vinson & Elkins did nothing wrong, the firm probably won't avoid legal action against it.
"Given their deep pockets and high profile, they're likely to be targets of plaintiffs looking for remedies," he said.
Just last August, another prominent Texas law firm, Locke Liddell & Sapp LLP, paid $8.5 million to settle a lawsuit brought against it by investors of Brian Russell Stearns, who was convicted of running a phony investment scam. And in April 2000, the same firm agreed to pay $22 million to settle a lawsuit brought by investors in Austin Forex International, a failed foreign currency firm run by former UT football star Russell Erxleben.
Investors claimed that Locke Liddell helped Stearns and Erxleben defraud them. Locke Liddell denied any wrongdoing but said it settled to avoid lengthy and expensive litigation - a decision that Vinson & Elkins may face eventually, said Dzienkowski.
Still, he said, Vinson & Elkins' professional reputation is so strong that he doubts it will suffer permanent harm.
To make sure, Vinson & Elkins has hired some of the top names in the legal profession to defend it. One is Joe Jamail, a renowned Houston trial lawyer better known for battling firms such as Vinson & Elkins than helping them. But Jamail already has persuaded plaintiffs' lawyers in two lawsuits against Enron to drop Vinson & Elkins as a defendant.
Another top gun hired by Vinson & Elkins is John Villa, of the top Washington firm of Williams & Connolly LLP. He specializes in defending prominent law firms.
Reasoner said Villa is overseeing Vinson & Elkins' cooperation with the various investigations: "I don't believe in our lawyers representing themselves when they're called on to testify as witnesses."
Founded in 1917, Vinson & Elkins is the second-largest law firm in Texas, according to a survey last year by a trade publication, Texas Lawyer. It has 860 lawyers, including 110 in its Austin office, making it one of the city's largest law firms. (Don Wood, partner in charge of the Austin office, said none of the Austin lawyers were assigned to Enron.) It also has offices in other cities, including Dallas, Washington, London, Moscow and Singapore.
Its revenues last year were about $455 million.
"Enron was only 7-plus percent of our revenue," Reasoner said. "That's significant, but I mean, it's not material to us economically in the sense of harming us. And of course people are upset by reading unpleasant publicity. But I don't think anyone is concerned that it will affect us in the long run."
Vinson & Elkins is the kind of firm people have in mind when they talk about "establishment" or "white shoe" lawyers, those representing banks, major corporations, insurers and wealthy individuals.
It is well-connected, politically and otherwise. Al Gonzales, general counsel to President Bush and a former Texas Supreme Court justice, is a former Vinson & Elkins partner. And some of Enron's 200-plus in-house lawyers used to work at Vinson & Elkins, including the company's general counsel, James Derrick.
(Another major Houston law firm that has done work for Enron, Bracewell & Patterson, has severed all ties with the company. Two of its partners, Marc Racicot, chairman of the Republican National Committee, and Greg Abbott, a candidate for Texas attorney general, have been criticized for their links to a firm working for Enron.)
Vinson & Elkins recruits some of the top law school graduates in the country - first-year associates start at $110,000 - and the firm, as well as Enron, has contributed to the UT Law School foundation. Reasoner serves on the foundation's board, as did Derrick until October.
Those connections have attracted some criticism of the Law School dean, William Powers, after he was elected last year to the Enron board and named chairman of a special committee to investigate the company's finances. Powers has denied any conflict.
The most obvious cloud on Vinson & Elkins' Enron dealings at this point appears to be the investigation it undertook last fall, at Enron's request, regarding warnings from an Enron executive that the company could "implode in a wave of accounting scandals."
The executive, Sherron Watkins, also advised former Enron Chairman Ken Lay not to use Vinson & Elkins for the investigation because it had provided legal advice in the past to some of the entities whose actions she was questioning. 
Most of her concerns, however, centered on the accounting of the transactions between the partnerships and Enron, warning that although they had the blessing of Arthur Andersen, "none of that will protect Enron if these transactions are ever disclosed in the bright light of day."
But Enron nevertheless selected Vinson & Elkins, which on Oct. 15 sent a seven-page letter to company executives that reported no apparent law-breaking and advised that there was no need to hire independent counsel or auditors. 
However, it warned that some of the transactions in question had "bad cosmetics," with "a serious risk of adverse publicity and litigation."
Reasoner said that Watkins' warnings did have an effect; Enron afterward acknowledged the problems and reported publicly its major financial losses.
And he hints that Vinson & Elkins did more than suggested by its report: "The notion that this was a whitewash or that the company didn't deal with it - I'm not free to say what our oral advice is or why they did what they did, but they certainly did deal with it."
And, Reasoner said, the firm "was not asked to examine our own legal work" in the investigation.
Others will, however, including Congress and the Securities and Exchange Commission.

New Prosecutor Is an `Iron Fist In a Velvet Glove'
By Jerry Markon

When James Comey was a federal prosecutor in Richmond, Va., he riled up the area's three federal judges in a way that prosecutors rarely do. In a highly unusual joint opinion, the judges criticized Mr. Comey's pet project to crack down on gun crimes by prosecuting them in federal courts, where sentencing was tougher, rather than state courts. 
"It's a total intrusion on the sovereign state of Virginia," Richard Williams, one of the judges, says in an interview. At the same time, he adds: "I have a very high regard for Jim Comey. . . . He did an outstanding job."
Such sentiment is often heard about Mr. Comey, who is expected to be confirmed soon by the Senate as the new U.S. attorney in Manhattan. Imposing at 6-foot-8 and reputed for his tenacity, Mr. Comey -- who's been involved in highly charged cases from terrorism to an earlier Enron Corp. case -- seems the classic tough-as-nails prosecutor. But as one Richmond defense lawyer, Steven Benjamin, puts it, Mr. Comey is "an iron fist in a velvet glove. He's extremely pleasant, but if you challenge him, you go to war. He will not yield an inch on something that matters to him." 
Allan Applbaum, a former New York federal prosecutor who worked with Mr. Comey in the early 1990s, notes: "He has this combination of strength and boyish charm that really does disarm people." 
Mr. Comey, 41 years old, will need these qualities in his new job, which he began on an interim basis last month. With its focus on Wall Street crime, the Mafia and, in recent years, terrorism, Manhattan's federal prosecutor is traditionally the most visible of the country's 93 U.S. attorneys. 
But since Sept. 11, the Bush administration has centralized terrorism investigations in Washington, saying the events required a coordinated national response. It's a significant change: Since the first World Trade Center attack in 1993, most major terrorism cases had been handled in New York. Now, key terrorism cases are being filed in Mr. Comey's old district in Virginia. 
A native of Yonkers, N.Y., Mr. Comey won the attention of Attorney General John Ashcroft and President Bush with accomplishments such as his quick indictment last year of 14 men in the 1996 terrorist bombing of military barracks in Saudi Arabia, which killed 19 American airmen. FBI officials had been frustrated at the slow pace of the government's investigation, and requested that the case be transferred to Mr. Comey, who was then in Richmond. 
As an assistant U.S. attorney in Manhattan during the early 1990s, Mr. Comey won guilty pleas from two former executives of Enron's oil-trading subsidiary to charges of conspiring to defraud the parent company through a series of phony oil- trading contracts. He also oversaw the hunt for fugitive Marc Rich, who was later pardoned by President Clinton. 
Mr. Comey recalls a 1992 trip to a mountaintop hotel in Zurich, Switzerland, expecting to meet Mr. Rich and his lawyers to arrange the fugitive's surrender. But Mr. Rich's side argued instead that the racketeering and tax-evasion charges he faced had no merit, and Switzerland had already refused the U.S.'s extradition request. 
"It was a bit frustrating. We felt we had wasted an enormous amount of time," Mr. Comey says. "The chocolates were lovely though." 
Mr. Comey had more success with his gun-crime program in Virginia starting in the mid-'90s. Facing concerns that Project Exile was anti-black because most gun crimes involve blacks, he met with the critical federal judges and community leaders to emphasize that the program would help victims. He eventually won widespread support for the program, which helped cut the murder rate in Richmond by half. At least 12 other cities, including Baltimore and Oakland, Calif., have started their own version of Project Exile. 
Mr. Comey calls his new position "a dream job," and seems confident that the New York office's central role in prosecuting high-profile cases will be maintained. "There's always a healthy tension between an aggressive, independent U.S. attorney's office and headquarters [in Washington], but I don't see any kind of sea change," he says.

Inside, Outside Enron, Audit Panel Is Scrutinized --- Links to Company Of Certain Members Are Called Too Cozy
By Joann S. Lublin
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

The Wall Street Journal

When the board audit committee of Enron Corp. gathered for a regular meeting at its Houston headquarters a year ago, the session should have been anything but routine. 
After all, Enron management wanted a blessing for every transaction during 2000 between the energy-trading company and two partnerships run by then-Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow. The controversial partnerships kept significant debt off the books, pumped up profits -- and earned Mr. Fastow more than $30 million.
Yet committee members, all of them outside directors, didn't challenge a single transaction, according to knowledgeable people and excerpts of the Feb. 12 meeting's minutes. Their indifference wasn't a complete surprise. The full board twice had taken the rare step of suspending the corporate-ethics code, so Mr. Fastow could head the partnerships. 
Subsequent disclosure of losses related to the partnerships hastened Enron's collapse. Now, amid finger-pointing at top management and the company's outside auditors at Arthur Andersen LLP, the audit committee is under harsh scrutiny from a slew of civil, criminal and congressional investigations -- and the board itself. 
A special board committee looking into the debacle is expected to partly blame the six-member audit panel in a report to be issued as early as this weekend. The report will cite slick presentations by sophisticated financial people along with lethargy on the part of audit-committee members, says an individual close to the situation. The panel discovered significant defects in procedures for monitoring financial results and controls, the individual adds. 
Critics who contend Enron's audit panel fell short cite several key reasons: Several members held cozy ties with the company, they say. The panel's chairman -- Robert K. Jaedicke, retired accounting professor and former dean of Stanford University's business school -- preferred a relatively passive role. And Andersen auditors apparently weren't persuaded that they should be answerable to the audit committee as their client. "It's the worst audit committee I have ever seen," asserts John Nash, president emeritus of the National Association of Corporate Directors. 
"This audit committee worked pretty well based on the information it was provided," retorts W. Neil Eggleston, counsel for Enron's outside directors and a partner at Howrey Simon Arnold & White in Washington. Andersen signed off on accounting practices and didn't alert members about "any impropriety or irregularity" until November, Mr. Eggleston adds. Audit-committee members either declined to comment about their role or didn't return calls. 
An Andersen spokesman, asked to respond to Mr. Eggleston's critique, said the notion that "the audit committee or senior management wasn't aware of the risks of the business decisions they were making is entirely implausible." Regarding criticism of its auditing work, Andersen says Enron withheld crucial information and misled the auditors about the partnerships; Enron fired Andersen last month. 
At first glance, Enron's pivotal audit panel, made up of prominent executives, looks well-qualified. But in reality, governance specialists contend, the committee's makeup is far from ideal. 
For one thing, half its members live abroad -- an uncommon practice at audit panels, which meet often and require a keen grasp of business practices here. As an American citizen, Hong Kong billionaire property developer Ronnie Chan may understand U.S. business. But he has the worst recent attendance record of any Enron director. He missed more than 25% of board and committee meetings during 1996, 1997 and 2000, according to proxy statements. (In 1998 and 1999 he missed fewer meetings, though the percentage wasn't reported because it was less than 25%.) 
Corporate-governance experts doubt some other audit-committee members are truly independent. Lord John Wakeham joined the board in 1994, four years after the then-British energy secretary approved plans for Enron to build a power plant in the United Kingdom. Since 1996, proxy statements show, he has earned $72,000 a year advising its European unit -- more than his $50,000 annual stipend for being a director. In a statement last week, Lord Wakeham's office said it "would clearly be wrong of him" to make any comments about his position at Enron while the matter is being investigated. 
John Mendelsohn is president of University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, which has received nearly $1.6 million in donations from Enron and related entities since 1985, the year his predecessor Charles A. LeMaistre became an Enron director. Dr. Mendelsohn has said the center doesn't depend heavily on Enron philanthropy. 
Dr. Jaedicke, who is 73 years old, is the most important -- and, to corporate governance experts, perhaps most problematic -- member of Enron's audit panel. The unpretentious retired academic commands respect for his meticulous thoroughness. But he has led the Enron audit panel since he obtained his board seat in 1985. Big-business boards typically switch committee heads every three to five years to maintain distance from management. 
Dr. Jaedicke feels his lengthy tenure never crimped his outside perspective, Mr. Eggleston says. But some question whether Dr. Jaedicke's long service to Enron may have contributed to his approach. 
He took a relatively passive role, for example, when the board first waived the ethics code in mid-1999. To form a private partnership called LJM Cayman LP, Mr. Fastow needed a special board ruling that his activities wouldn't violate policies intended to protect against executives being involved in activities that might pose a conflict of interest or harm Enron. 
The audit committee's charter, disclosed in the latest proxy statement, describes its responsibility for overseeing ethics-code compliance. Yet the panel took no action about suspending the code before the full board met; nor did Dr. Jaedicke propose an audit-committee review during that board meeting, Mr. Eggleston reports. 
"The audit committee should have made the code suspension part of their work, especially since the partnership would involve the CFO," says Charles Elson, director of the Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware's business school. And Dr. Jaedicke, as the committee's chairman, "should have been upset over the proposed waiver of the code." 
To the contrary, according to excerpted minutes from Enron's board meeting on June 28, 1999, it was Dr. Jaedicke who seconded the motion suspending the ethics code when directors approved a resolution that Mr. Fastow's partnership participation "will not adversely affect the interests of the Company." 
He saw the partnership as a "one-off, isolated transaction. It didn't look like there was much risk at that time," Mr. Eggleston explains. In addition, the lawyer continues, committee members "believed that Arthur Andersen was involved in blessing the LJM partnerships." 
Also raising eyebrows is the audit committee's lack of involvement in deciding which law firm would conduct the nearly two-month probe into a letter warning of questionable accounting last August by Enron Vice President Sherron Watkins. Her letter raised alarms about the unorthodox partnerships and their potential danger to Enron's finances and public image. 
At numerous companies, the audit-committee chairman decides which law firm should probe a serious whistle-blowing complaint. "That's the only way you maintain the integrity of the company," says Roderick M. Hills, a former Securities and Exchange Commission chairman who has led more than six audit committees. 
Instead, at Enron, management made the decision to retain Houston law firm Vinson & Elkins to explore concerns described in the letter Ms. Watkins sent and discussed with then-chairman Kenneth Lay. Her letter cautioned against using Vinson & Elkins as investigators because it had issued legal opinions endorsing some of the partnerships. 
Dr. Jaedicke didn't learn about the Watkins letter or the outside lawyers' inquiry until it ended, when Vinson & Elkins briefed him about the finding, Mr. Eggleston says. He maintains this didn't bother Dr. Jaedicke because he knew corporate policy required that in-house attorneys review employee complaints from any level and decide whether to seek outside legal help. Critics say that the Vinson & Elkins Oct. 15 report in effect ignored the accounting problems, by concluding that Enron's practice of forming special-purpose entities to keep debt off its books was "creative and aggressive" but wasn't "inappropriate from a technical standpoint." 
Enron's auditors also knew about the Watkins allegations long before the audit committee did. An Aug. 21 Andersen memo summarizes a conversation in which the whistle-blowing executive, a former Andersen auditor, shared her concerns about Enron's questionable accounting with an Andersen audit partner not assigned there. The partner passed along what he termed "a very troublesome scenario" to several Enron auditors at Andersen and to the firm's lawyers. Andersen says it also informed Enron management. 
By Oct. 9, Andersen analysts had determined there was "a red alert: a heightened risk of financial-statement fraud" at Enron, according to an Andersen e-mail. The Andersen spokesman says the financial-statement test described in the e-mail was conducted on an "experimental basis" using software later found to be flawed and doesn't know what actions auditors took to address the "red alert." 
Again, however, Enron's audit committee didn't immediately learn of this. Not until Nov. 2, when the company's financial condition had seriously deteriorated, did Andersen tell the Enron board of "possible illegal acts within the company" concerning one partnership, Andersen Chief Executive Joseph Berardino told lawmakers. Six days later, the complex partnerships caused Enron to restate nearly $600 million in earnings reported over five years. 
Some suspect Andersen auditors failed to keep Enron's audit committee well-informed because they saw their main responsibility as serving the company's management, and not the full board or the audit committee. "It's usually the comptroller that recommends to the audit committee who the auditors should be," a former Enron official observes. Andersen auditors worked "with the company day by day. They saw the audit committee once a quarter." 
Yet at some companies audit-panel chairmen aggressively try to reverse that misconception, thereby protecting auditors against management mischief. "You're there to make sure [auditors] report to you" and that only directors can fire them, Mr. Hills says. So, he occasionally spends all day at auditors' offices making sure they consider conservative accounting methods. "Enron is emblematic of a culture in corporate life that needs to be rooted out," he maintains.

UT dean too close to Enron inquiry
Editorial Board
Austin American-Statesman

University of Texas Law School Dean William Powers Jr. has been described as a man with an unswerving moral compass. 
There is no reason to believe otherwise. But frankly, the dean's moral compass is not the issue in the debate over whether he should lead Enron's internal investigation of what went wrong with the Houston-based energy trader. 
Public trust is the issue. 
Powers is a member of the Enron board. His law school has close ties to Enron and its money. The dean is probing partnerships that hid the company's losses. As lead investigator, Powers will issue a report on the nature of those transactions. 
The goal of the investigation -- to get to the bottom of Enron's financial scandal -- clearly is compromised with Powers at the helm. Powers should step down from that role to ensure that there can be no questioning or doubt about the objectivity of the inquiry. Enron, a publicly traded company, owes its shareholders an investigation. Investors, out-of-work employees and others are entitled to a comprehensive probe that steers clear of conflicts -- even perceived ones. 
That is why the Enron board should hire a third party with no ties to the company for the job. 
The larger principle at stake in the board's investigation is public confidence. U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft as well as Texas Attorney General John Cornyn set an example by recusing themselves from investigating Enron, which contributed heavily to both. Ashcroft lost his U.S. Senate seat last year in his native Missouri. Ashcroft and Cornyn wisely understood that the issue was not whether they could conduct fair investigations, but whether the public would trust their investigations given their financial ties to Enron and its former CEO, Ken Lay. 
That is the issue at the heart of the debate over Powers. Unfortunately, the Enron board doesn't seem to get it. It downplays ties between Enron and UT, including the close connection between Powers and top Enron executive James Derrick Jr. 
Derrick is a major fund-raiser for the UT law school and, until recently, was a member of its Law School Foundation that supplements Powers' UT salary. He resigned after Powers joined the Enron board. 
After Enron made the last installment of its $250,000 pledge to the UT law school last year, Powers sent Derrick a handwritten note, "Thank you for all you do for us!" 
The Enron-UT-Powers connections go deeper. Houston-based Vinson & Elkins, with offices in Austin, is a generous donor to the law school. Enron is one of the firm's major clients. 
We wanted to discuss these issues with Powers. But we were referred to Karen Denne, an Enron public relations representative in Houston. 
Denne said the board doesn't see anything wrong with Powers heading the investigation. It appointed him to the board last fall for that very purpose, she said. The company had begun its financial free fall when Powers joined the board in October. 
"The board specifically brought Dean Powers on board to head up this special investigation so we would have a comprehensive, independent review and investigation of the partnerships in question." 
Denne added that the board concluded, "Powers' credentials and reputation in the legal field outweigh any perceived legal conflict." 
It's not the board's view that matters most. It's the public's, and the public is not likely to trust a report produced by someone with Powers' connections to Enron. Then there are the real people who got hurt -- former Enron employees, teachers and others who saw their pensions and life savings evaporate as Enron stock crashed. They are even less likely to trust an inquiry by Powers. 
Those are legitimate doubts. They already are clouding Powers' investigation and will surely taint his findings -- however reliable they might otherwise be. 
Texas' economy will feel aftershocks from Enron's fall. The public deserves an accounting it can trust from an impartial outsider. Powers should step aside.

ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: COLLEGE REACTION
Watchdog Group Wants Investigation on Harvard Official
By NEELA BANERJEE and REED ABELSON

A group of Harvard students and alumni called yesterday for the university to investigate whether a member of its governing body might have given insider information to an investment fund that manages part of Harvard's endowment, permitting it to profit from the fall in Enron's stock price late last year. 
The group acknowledged that it had no evidence.
The focus of the group, HarvardWatch, is Herbert S. Winokur Jr., a longtime Enron director who is also a member of the Harvard Corporation, which runs the university. 
Mr. Winokur has no direct ties to the fund. Mr. Winokur is chairman of the finance committee on Enron's board. 
In a statement issued last night, the university said: ''Mr. Winokur is a valued member of the Harvard Corporation. The university is reviewing the situation for any developments that have a genuine bearing on Harvard.'' 
HarvardWatch, a relatively new organization, said that Highfields Capital Management, an investment manager with ties to Harvard, profited by acquiring options last year betting that Enron's stock would fall. 
The group estimated that the positions would have yielded $50 million to $120 million in profit. 
Highfields declined to comment on the assertions. But W. Neil Eggleston, a lawyer who is representing Enron's outside directors, said: ''Mr. Winokur has a long history of personal and financial commitment to Harvard, and he has no plans to walk away from the institution. Mr. Winokur had no involvement with Highfields Capital and any suggestion that he tipped the fund to short sell Enron stock is just plain wrong.'' 
HarvardWatch wants an inquiry into any contact between Mr. Winokur, a Harvard alumnus, and Highfields. 
''We by no means have evidence of insider communications, but we feel the situation certainly warrants investigation,'' said Molly McOwen of HarvardWatch. ''Why did Highfields have the confidence to sell the stock when no one else did?'' 
Highfields was skeptical about Enron's performance far earlier than most money managers. 
Mr. Winokur did not sell any of his own shares in Enron last year, records show. 
Mr. Winokur is a director of the Harvard Management Company, which oversees the university's endowment. 
HarvardWatch said it was also pursuing potential conflicts concerning other ties with Enron.

ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: THE ARMY SECRETARY
Former Executive, Now in Washington, Denies Impropriety at His Unit
By JAMES DAO

c. 2002 New York Times Company

WASHINGTON, Jan. 31 -- Thomas E. White, the secretary of the Army, vigorously defended today the business practices of a major Enron division that he helped manage until early last year, rejecting in an interview assertions by former employees that there was improper accounting at the unit. 
Mr. White and Enron officials said that the division, Enron Energy Services, was getting out of the business of providing energy services to military bases before Mr. White was named Army secretary last spring. As a result, Mr. White said, he has not needed to disqualify himself from any decisions relating to Enron after he took office in May.
Several former employees of Enron Energy Services have said that while Mr. White was vice chairman of the unit, it overstated its profits by hundreds of millions of dollars, using shoddy accounting practices to create illusory earnings. Those assertions have come under scrutiny by several committees on Capitol Hill investigating Enron's collapse. 
Mr. White denied the ex-employees' accusations. ''As far as I am concerned, Enron Energy Services was a great business,'' he said in an interview that ranged widely across military issues and the Enron matter. ''We built it from nothing. There were no accounting irregularities that I was aware of.'' 
Questions about Enron Energy Services became public last week with news reports of an e-mail message sent last year by a former employee, Margaret Ceconi, to Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman at the time. Ms. Ceconi, a former sales manager, said that Enron Energy Services had hidden losses on contracts worth more than $500 million. 
''This is common knowledge among all the E.E.S. employees, and is actually joked about,'' she said in the message, dated Aug. 29, 2001. Since Enron's bankruptcy filing in December, Enron Energy Services has laid off most of its 1,000 employees and walked away from many of its contracts. Those include a $25 million contract to provide services to Fort Hamilton in New York that Enron won when Mr. White, a retired Army brigadier general, was a company executive. 
The Army is in negotiations with Enron Energy Services over its default on the Fort Hamilton contract. 
Other former employees have said that the division used aggressive projections and accounting to overstate earnings during Mr. White's tenure. The employees said that they did not know whether Mr. White or Lou L. Pai, the unit's chairman at the time, were aware of this. 
On Wednesday, the House Energy and Commerce Committee sent a letter to Mr. Lay asking him to explain what Enron did in response to Ms. Ceconi's e-mail message. 
Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat who is chairman of the investigations subcommittee of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, also raised questions about Mr. White's financial ties to Enron in a letter to the Office of Government Ethics. Mr. Levin's office said today that he had not received a response from the ethics office. 
In the interview today, Mr. White dismissed Ms. Ceconi's claims of improprieties, and he argued that most of her e-mail message was devoted to complaints about how the company had treated her. Her personal complaints seemed valid, he said, though he suggested that the management team that succeeded him was responsible for her problems. 
''I think she has a case from what I know about it and what I've read about it that her employment at Enron was not properly handled,'' Mr. White said. ''She was recruited into a specific area of the business, and the new leadership team at Enron Energy Service decided to head the business in a new direction. Unfortunately, she got caught in the middle of it.'' 
In the e-mail message, Ms. Ceconi said she was recruited to leave her job at GE Capital by Enron Energy Services with promises of a compensation package worth as much $1 million a year. Instead, she was laid off in less than a year as the company began to crumble. Ms. Ceconi did not return calls for comment. 
While Mr. White was at Enron Energy Services, the company created a unit called Enron Federal Solutions that aggressively pursued contracts with the Pentagon to provide energy services at military bases. Congress had authorized the privatization of utility services at bases in 1997, and the following year the secretary of defense, William S. Cohen, ordered the armed services to try to privatize electric, natural gas and other utilities at all bases by 2003. 
A spokeswoman for Enron Energy Services said that by March 2001, before Mr. White was nominated to be Army secretary, the division had already decided to stop bidding on military contracts. At the time, the company had bid on five contracts to provide services to about a dozen bases, including some Army bases. 
When Mr. White took office, he strongly endorsed the Army's energy privatization policy. Some consumer groups, including Public Citizen, have raised questions about possible conflict of interest. 
In a letter last week to Representative Henry A. Waxman of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Committee on Government Reform, Mr. White said he had been in contact with 13 different Enron employees, including Mr. Lay, on 29 occasions since taking office. But Mr. White said that all of those contacts had been personal in nature. 
Today, Mr. White said that no decisions regarding Enron had come to his office. ''I have taken no action at any point or at any time that would benefit Enron corporations in any way with utilities privatization or any other endeavor,'' he said. 
According to government disclosure filings, Mr. White's final salary at Enron was $5.5 million. To comply with ethics rules, he was compelled to sell 405,710 shares of Enron last year at prices ranging from $50 to $12.85 a share, well below the stock's peak. Still, he received $12 million. 
''I guess I would say that there is a terrible tragedy that has unfolded there,'' Mr. White said today. ''I have many friends, as well as myself, who have suffered losses.''

Accountants Won't Fight Consulting Ban
Jackie Spinner
Washington Post Staff Writer

Copyright 2002, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved

Arthur Andersen, KPMG and the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants said yesterday that they will drop their opposition to a ban on accounting firms providing certain consulting services. 
That sharp reversal of the position they took two years ago was viewed by lawmakers as an effort to head off new restrictions that Congress is considering in the wake of the Enron collapse and other corporate accounting blowups.
Meanwhile, PricewaterhouseCoopers announced plans to split off its $6.7 billion management-consulting business into a separate public entity, an attempt to reassure the public of the independence of the firm's audits. 
At the same time, one of PricewaterhouseCoopers auditing clients, Walt Disney Co., said it would no longer use PwC for consulting projects because of the debate over auditor independence. 
And New York State Comptroller H. Carl McCall also called for a ban on auditors providing consulting services in most cases. McCall oversees the state pension fund, which lost millions on Enron stock. 
The federal government gave the accounting industry the valuable franchise of auditing companies that sell shares to the public after the stock market crash of 1929. The auditors are supposed to be independent watchdogs and do their best to make sure investors can trust corporate financial statements. 
Over the years, accounting firms have done increasing amounts of consulting work for their clients. Former Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Arthur Levitt Jr. feared that auditors would be reluctant to get tough with clients and risk losing lucrative consulting work. 
In 2000, Levitt tried to ban auditors from providing information technology and consulting services, and from conducting internal audits for their clients. 
KPMG, Deloitte & Touche, Arthur Andersen and the AICPA opposed that effort, threatening to go to court to block the SEC. Ultimately, they got lawmakers to pressure Levitt to back off. 
Now, however, the Enron scandal and other corporate accounting blowups have cost investors billions of dollars and created a new political climate for reform. 
Stephen G. Butler, chief executive of KPMG, said he hoped that by lifting its opposition, the industry could steer the regulatory debate away from auditor independence and the services limitations Levitt had wanted, which he called "a red herring" for the profession. 
Barry Melancon, the AICPA president who was also a fierce critic of Levitt's efforts, said he believes that limiting the type of services that an audit firm can perform would not have prevented the Enron meltdown. But Melancon said industry representatives recognize that the auditor independence issue is "front and center." 
"We need the profession to address it," he said. "If we didn't address these two issues, people would be saying that we are trying to deflect. We are saying we are stepping up to the plate first." 
Andersen, which has been criticized for its handling of Enron's audits, also decided yesterday to drop its opposition to the scope-of-services restrictions. "Andersen went voluntarily before Congress in December and made a commitment that it would look at its practices and that it would be making changes," said Andersen spokesman Charlie Leonard. "We are pleased to say the direction the industry is moving toward is something Andersen supports." 
Deloitte & Touche, the other major accounting firm that had opposed Levitt's ban, did not follow Andersen and KPMG yesterday. A spokeswoman for Deloitte & Touche said in a statement that the firm would not "accept or reject any single proposal whether we agree with it or not, because the effectiveness of a complete set of reforms is what ultimately needs to be assessed." 
PricewaterhouseCoopers and Ernst & Young did not oppose the SEC two years ago and said they would maintain that position. 
PricewaterhouseCoopers announced two years ago that it planned to spin off several businesses, including its consulting business. PwC officials said yesterday that they decided to speed up their plans for an initial public offering for PwC Consulting because of the current concerns about auditor independence. PwC's IPO plans were first reported in the Wall Street Journal. 
Lawmakers said it's unclear whether these various moves by accounting firms will be sufficient to head off legislative actions. "I'm delighted by their conversion, but too little, too late," said Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.), the ranking Democrat on the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. 
"The culture has changed," said Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.). "Congress has got to get the consumer protections into a statute. It doesn't count unless you get it into a federal statute." 
In the Senate, Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.) and Jon S. Corzine (D-N.J.) have proposed legislation that would prohibit firms from providing audit and consulting services to the same client. 
"We've got a serious public confidence issue that needs to be addressed," he said. 
Dodd called the industry's action a "positive development." But noting that the accounting industry was not united in this action, he said it "also highlights the need for uniformity in the industry. 
Rep. Richard H. Baker (R-La.), chairman of the House Financial Services subcommittee on capital markets, said that Congress would be aggressive about pursuing reforms but that legislation may not be needed to change many things. 
"We're dealing with a culture, not just an accounting rule change," Baker said. 
Barbara Roper, director of investor protection for the Consumer Federation of America, said the industry has agreed to stop fighting only "the most minimally accepted reform." 
"It shouldn't shift the focus away from broader issues of auditor independence," Roper said. "Leaving aside the pension issue, auditor independence is the central focus of Enron. It's the only thing that explains why Andersen would sign off on books they knew were misleading."

TV Ad Assails Dole for Enron Fundraiser; In Election Year, Candidates Across Country Could Face Similar Criticism

It was, says Elizabeth Dole's Senate campaign, just an afterthought. 
In the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the North Carolina Republican suspended campaign activities. But she kept a Sept. 20 speaking engagement to a Christian women's gathering in Houston. Then, in what aides called a "last-minute decision," she agreed to let Kenneth L. Lay, then Enron Corp.'s chairman, host a fundraising lunch for her at a Houston hotel.
It proved a costly decision. North Carolina Democrats today begin airing a TV ad attacking Dole for the Enron event, making her the first prominent politician to be targeted by a well-financed effort for having connections to the bankrupt energy company. 
She is unlikely to be the last. 
In Colorado, Connecticut, Texas and other states, the Enron scandal has seeped into state and congressional races, forcing Republicans to defend even modest brushes with the company now under widespread investigation. The targets include the president's brother, Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, where the state pension fund lost $325 million when Enron stock plummeted last fall. 
It is unclear whether the criticisms will stick, let alone influence voters nine months from now. Even some Democratic strategists urge caution, noting that many Democrats also have accepted Enron money. But with polls showing high presidential approval ratings -- along with greater voter confidence in Republicans than in Democrats on an array of issues -- some Democrats see the unfolding Enron saga as their best hope for a surge in the November elections. 
"Enron has the potential to shape the entire political environment for 2002, impact other issues and reduce confidence in the Bush administration and Republicans," three well-known Democratic advisers wrote in a recent memo to members of Congress. "The more people hear, the more corrosive it becomes," wrote James Carville, Stanley Greenberg and Robert Shrum. 
North Carolina may provide the first test. Dole, a former Cabinet member and one-time presidential contender, is strongly favored to win the GOP nomination to succeed retiring Sen. Jesse Helms (R). Democrats haven't settled on a nominee, but they have eagerly criticized Dole for collecting $20,000 at Lay's luncheon. 
Dole has given $5,000 of that amount -- which came directly from Lay or his relatives -- to a special fund for displaced Enron employees. But that hasn't stopped a barrage of news stories and critical editorials. 
Now comes the Democratic TV ad, to air in three North Carolina cities over 12 days. It says Dole attended "a secret fundraiser" hosted by Lay. It quotes a Winston-Salem Journal editorial that said, "while Dole's campaign was publicly stating it had put its activities on hold, it was conducting fundraisers at the house of a scoundrel." 
In a section not cited in the ad, the editorial also said, "The state Democratic Party, which has looked silly trying to find mud to throw at Dole, has uncovered a whole puddle." The Houston fundraiser "shows that Dole is one more politician into whom Lay appears to have sunk his financial claws." 
Democrats note Dole's campaign hired Washington-based consultant Edward Gillespie, a key Enron link to Republican House leaders and the White House. Campaign sources said Gillespie's Enron lobbying did not overlap with his work for Dole and he was not involved in the Houston fundraiser. 
In Florida, Gov. Jeb Bush is trying to get out in front of his potential Enron problem. The governor, who is seeking reelection this fall, has joined others in calling for an investigation of the state employee pension fund's $325 million loss in Enron stock. Much of the stock was bought after Oct. 22, when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission warned it was investigating the company. 
Bush is one of three board members who oversee the fund. He joined Florida Attorney General Robert A. "Bob" Butterworth (D) in calling for an inquiry focusing on Alliance Capital Management LP, the New York firm that made the Enron purchases. 
Through Alliance, the pension fund paid $9 to $82 a share for Enron stock, which it sold for 28 cents a share on Nov. 30, according to Florida news accounts. While newspapers have noted the governor's role in overseeing the pension fund, Democrats are moving cautiously. 
Florida Democratic Chairman Bob Poe said, "Right now, I don't see where [Bush] had control of Alliance Capital. Maybe someone shows me how he should be responsible, but right now, I don't see that." 
Poe was more critical of Bush's decision to attend a January fundraiser for the Florida GOP at the Houston home of Richard D. Kinder, who was president of Enron until 1996. 
"It's a tremendous lapse of judgment," Poe said. "For the people who lost their life savings and for the participants of the Florida pension fund that lost $300 million, this seems incredibly insensitive." 
In Connecticut, the Manchester Journal Inquirer reported that Enron spent $297,150 from 1999 to 2001 for legal and lobbying services. Most of the money went to a firm employing Michael J. Martone, a former top aide to Gov. John G. Rowland (R). Martone lobbied the state to fund a fuel-cell project proposed by Enron and the Connecticut Resource Recovery Association. 
In Texas, Enron's collapse has touched scores of politicians. Gov. Rick Perry (R) has declined to return roughly $200,000 in Enron-related contributions. The money includes $25,000 that Lay donated the day after Perry appointed Lay's choice, former Enron official Max Yzaguirre, to the Public Utility Commission. Yzaguirre later resigned. 
In Colorado, Democratic Senate challenger Tom Strickland accused Sen. Wayne Allard (R) of contributing to Enron's collapse by opposing prompt enactment of a proposed rule change governing accounting firms. 
"Allard asked for the rules to be delayed, which in effect caused the rules to be killed, which killed any chance of preventing the Enron debacle," Strickland campaign manager Brian Hardwick told the Denver Post. 
Allard campaign manager Dick Wadhams told the newspaper that the senator sought "a delay so that Congress could spend more time considering the measure. The request was made by senators of both political parties."

ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: THE POLITICS
In Commercial, Elizabeth Dole Is Chastised For Enron Ties
By ALISON MITCHELL

02/01/2002
The New York Times
Page 5, Column 6
c. 2002 New York Times Company

WASHINGTON, Jan. 31 -- In their first effort to turn the Enron collapse into an overt campaign issue, Democrats today unveiled a commercial attacking Elizabeth Dole, one of the Republicans' best-known Senate hopefuls, for attending a fund-raiser given by Kenneth L. Lay, the former chairman of Enron. 
The 30-second spot, sponsored by the North Carolina Democratic Party with financial assistance from the Washington-based Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, takes to task Mrs. Dole, the former presidential candidate who is the prohibitive favorite in the Republican primary for the North Carolina Senate seat being vacated by Jesse Helms. The Democrats have not yet chosen their Senate candidate.
In the advertisement, an announcer intones that Mrs. Dole said she had put her campaign on hold in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks but then nine days later flew to ''a secret fund-raiser'' given by Mr. Lay. ''Tell Elizabeth Dole we expect the truth,'' the announcer says. 
Mary Brown Brewer, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Dole, called it ''sad that the Democrats have already resorted to personal attack ads.'' Ms. Brewer added, ''It's this kind of bitter partisanship and reckless negativity that voters are tired of.'' 
The commercial -- unusual at a time when both parties are still holding primary contests in North Carolina -- comes as Democrats have begun trying to use the Enron collapse to portray the Bush administration and Congressional Republicans as tied to wealthy special interests. 
Ms. Brewer took issue with the Democrats' advertisement. She said Mrs. Dole flew to Houston in late September to speak to a Christian women's group, then went to the fund-raiser. She said that it was not secret and that Mrs. Dole would give all contributions from Enron, its executives or its employees to a fund for Enron employees. She said that about $5,000 raised at the Houston event came from Enron. 
Until now, Democrats had largely used Enron as a metaphor and as a way of raising doubts about Republican policies. 
''I think we are slowly Enronizing the economy, Enronizing the budget,'' Senator Tom Daschle, the majority leader, said this month, speaking about the reappearance of federal deficits. 
In a Jan. 28 memo to Democrats, three prominent Democratic strategists, Stan Greenberg, James Carville and Bob Shrum, said the Enron collapse ''has the potential to shape the entire political environment for 2002, impact other issues and reduce confidence in the Bush administration and the Republicans.'' 
They wrote that polls showed that the more people heard about the company, ''the more corrosive it becomes.'' 
''This is an issue where Democrats ought to talk about right and wrong, greed and responsibility,'' they wrote. 
More than a dozen Congressional investigations into Enron are under way. But Democrats have been cautious until now about being too overtly political and have focused on policy. Some party strategists say they do not want to overplay their hand. 
This week, after the memo surfaced, Mr. Daschle said, ''The last thing we should do is politicize the scandal.'' 
But the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee is closely tied to Mr. Daschle and is in charge of preserving and increasing the Democrat's fragile majority. 
James M. Jordan, the executive director of the Senate Democrat's election committee, argued that the ad ''fundamentally is not about Enron. It's about her campaign's lack of honesty and about politics as usual.'' 
He said the commercial would run for at least 12 days in major media markets in North Carolina and on cable television in Washington ''so the Doles can watch the ad in their home at the Watergate.'' 
Mrs. Dole's primary residence is in Washington along with her husband, Bob. Democrats have accused her of being a carpetbagger though she grew up in North Carolina. She recently took title to the North Carolina house where she grew up and her mother still lives. 
Three Democrats are also in a primary battle for Mr. Helms's seat: Erskine B. Bowles, a former White House chief of staff; Daniel T. Blue Jr., a state representative; and Elaine F. Marshall, the secretary of state. Republicans in Washington say that if Mr. Bowles wins the primary, they are prepared to use the Clinton administration's own ties to Enron against him. 
Enron was a major donor to the Democratic National Committee in the Clinton years. Mr. Lay played golf with Mr. Clinton and stayed overnight in the White House.

ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: THE ENERGY TASK FORCE
Enron Won Some and Lost Some in White House Energy Report
By JOSEPH KAHN

02/01/2002
The New York Times
Page 5, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

Though the General Accounting Office plans to sue the White House to learn how much influence Enron and other energy companies had on the Bush administration's energy policies, one scorecard has been publicly available for months. 
In its National Energy Strategy, a 170-page list of recommendations released in May, the Bush administration detailed its views on regulating electricity transmission, using coal and natural gas resources and controlling pollution, all vital to Enron.
The company and its executives were among the largest contributors to President Bush, and company officials including Kenneth L. Lay, the chief executive who resigned last week, had at least five meetings with administration officials to discuss energy. Yet the company's record on shaping the administration approach is mixed. 
Energy experts and lobbyists say Enron had reason to celebrate some of the administration's recommendations, especially its efforts to create a nationwide electricity transmission grid. But the energy plan rejected or ignored many other Enron priorities, including the company's hopes of expanding the use of natural gas, controlling emissions of carbon dioxide and stripping states of their control of electricity transmission lines. 
''It never looked like an Enron wish list to me,'' said Jonathan Weisgall, Washington representative for MidAmerican Energy Holdings, a utility company that also lobbied to shape the administration's energy policies. 
''There were some things they and many other companies wanted that showed up there,'' Mr. Weisgall said. ''On some things Enron wanted the most, they got nothing at all.'' 
Take electricity transmission. Because Enron specialized in trading supplies of electricity, it pushed for years to create a more open, less-regulated transmission grid that would allow it to buy or sell electricity regardless of where the power was produced. 
In interviews last spring with The New York Times and the PBS program ''Frontline,'' Mr. Lay said that removing transmission bottlenecks was critical to the company. ''It's the high-voltage backbone for the electric industries,'' he said. ''It's kind of like a superhighway system for electricity.'' (Fresh excerpts from the interview will be broadcast tonight on the PBS program ''Now With Bill Moyers.'') 
An Enron memo drafted before Mr. Lay met Mr. Cheney to discuss energy policy in April expanded on the company's transmission goals. The memo, a copy of which Enron gave The Times last spring, called transmission failures a big reason ''the benefits of competition have yet to be realized and have not yet reached consumers.'' 
The final energy report reflects some of Enron's positions. The administration said it would urge federal regulators to promote open transmission. It also called for a new, self-regulatory body to oversee transmission grids, as Enron wanted. 
Enron also asked the Bush administration to agree to seize private land for construction of more transmission towers. The energy plan endorsed that idea. 
But the administration declined to pursue the most aggressive of Enron's recommendations. Enron wanted the states to lose any jurisdiction over transmission and proposed to have federal regulators take full control because they would presumably break up regional monopolies. But the energy plan endorsed no such action. 
Representative Henry A. Waxman, the California Democrat whose inquiries prompted the General Accounting Office inquiry last spring, argues that Enron's apparent influence was so sweeping that a thorough investigation was needed into how the administration compiled the energy plan. 
Last month, Mr. Waxman identified 17 items in the report that he said benefited Enron. He added that ''numerous policies in the White House energy plan are virtually identical to the positions Enron advocated.'' 
Yet some energy experts and lobbyists said that most of the items were not specific favors for Enron, but broad policy goals that reflected a consensus of many energy companies, including Enron's competitors. When Enron's policy goals did not enjoy broad support, the company often struck out. 
As a natural gas trader, Enron has long promoted the use of natural gas over coal. It has even advocated that the government cap carbon dioxide emissions by power plants as a way of encouraging utilities to switch to cleaner-burning natural gas. Enron also hoped to profit by trading emission rights. 
The administration did not deliver for Enron on these counts. 
On other issues, Enron's track record was uncertain. During the California energy crisis last year, the administration pleased Enron and other energy traders by taking a strong stand against caps on electricity prices. The administration also selected two candidates backed by Mr. Lay to serve on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which oversees electricity trading. 
But after the two Republican commissioners took office, they quickly adopted a plan to impose price controls in California. Some experts argue that this step eased price spikes and denied continued high trading profits to Enron and other companies. 
Still, some critics said that even if the substance of the administration's energy policies did not always meet Enron's expectations, they often mirrored longstanding industry goals and neglected the concerns of environmentalists and consumer groups. 
''It was the lips of industry to the ear of God,'' said Mark Cooper of the Consumer Federation of America. ''This is an issue about process more than substance.''

THE NATION THE FALL OF ENRON Despite Recession, Perks for Top Executives Grow Pay: Hidden benefits mushroom as employees' retirement plans shrink.

The lavish retirement plans, low-interest loans and other perquisites showered on Enron Corp. managers have put a spotlight on a growing corporate trend--one of ever-richer executive benefits packages whose costs often can be hidden from shareholders. 
Compensation experts say companies are increasingly using executives' benefits packages, which already are far more generous than those offered to rank-and-file workers, as a way to quietly beef up total pay for top managers regardless of how their company performs.
Sumptuous paychecks for executives are nothing new. But shareholder activists say weak regulatory requirements, along with a faltering stock market, are leading to unchecked growth in executive retirement plans and other benefits even as lower-ranking workers face losses and cutbacks in their own plans. 
"The trend has been [for executives] to be greedier and greedier, even though there's a recession," said Cynthia Richson, director of corporate governance for the State of Wisconsin Investment Board. "All this is designed to keep executives whole while the rank and file loses ground." 
As many workers' 401(k) retirement plans shrink, executives at some companies get guaranteed returns on their investments. Other companies pour hundreds of millions into special executive-only retirement accounts. Firms also pay for big insurance policies and offer executives multimillion-dollar loans, complete with below-market interest rates and a company promise to forgive some of the payments. 
Unlike salaries, bonuses and stock options--which must be laid out in government filings--the true cost of these benefits is often difficult, if not impossible, for outsiders to determine, said Ken Bertsch, director of corporate governance for TIAA-CREF, the world's largest pension fund manager. 
For a variety of accounting and regulatory reasons, companies often are not required to report the price tag for many of their executive benefits to the Securities and Exchange Commission. When benefits are disclosed, their costs can be tucked into footnotes or lumped into a catchall category of "other compensation," said Nell Minow, editor of the Corporate Library, which tracks compensation trends. 
The costs of many executive retirement plans are particularly easy to hide, since companies have to reveal few details, compensation experts said. 
"The regulatory disclosure rules are so weak, [companies] can get away with one or two ambiguously worded sentences in the middle of a paragraph about the rank-and-file [retirement] plan," Richson said. 
These feeble disclosure requirements, combined with poor stock market performance, have spawned a cottage industry in the last year of compensation consultants who are promoting supplemental executive retirement arrangements, benefits experts said. These plans are designed and promoted specifically as a way to enhance compensation that's "off the radar screen of shareholders," Richson and other compensation experts said. 
Unlike stock options or bonuses, which are tied to the company's performance, executives benefit from these supplemental retirement plans whether or not the company does well. 
Executives can lose these retirement benefits if the company declares bankruptcy, since the plans are not protected by the government-run Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. But shareholder activists say most executives are at little risk because relatively few companies actually go broke. 
Companies say they need to offer ample benefits to attract and retain top-flight managers. In addition, many of the plans designed for rank-and-file workers don't provide enough retirement pay for executives used to living on much higher salaries, compensation consultants said. 
Traditional pension plans limit benefits to highly paid executives because the plans can take into account no more than $200,000 of salary when determining benefits. The IRS also requires companies to cap the 401(k) contributions of their highest-paid workers, so many executives are prevented from making the full $11,000 annual contributions the law otherwise allows. 
About 60% of the executive retirement plans Mercer surveyed in 1998 made up for the benefits that otherwise would have been lost to IRS rules, said Janet M. Den Uyl, head of executive benefits and compensation for William M. Mercer Inc., a compensation consultant. 
The 40% of companies that offer richer plans--either to all their executives or to their top one or two leaders--often are trying to lure talent from other firms or prevent defections, Den Uyl said. 
The richest arrangements of all, not surprisingly, are aimed at the companies' top leaders. 
"There's more license at the CEO level," Den Uyl said. Most CEOs already have rich compensation packages, "and they're not ready to throw those away" when hired by a new company. 
Here are some of the non-salary perks companies have made available to top managers: 
* Guaranteed returns on investment. Top executives at Enron could contribute salary and bonuses to so-called deferred compensation accounts with guaranteed minimum annual returns of 12%. Struggling telecom-equipment giant Lucent Technologies Inc. has a similar plan that promises to pay five percentage points more than the 10-year Treasury rate. Currently, that Treasury rate is about 5%, which means Lucent executives in the plan get a 10% return on their investments. 
Enron and Lucent are far from alone. About half the companies that offer deferred compensation plans provide a guaranteed minimum return, according to a Mercer study. 
* Bigger company matches. The typical company match for a 401(k) defined contribution plan is 50 cents for every dollar the employee contributes, up to 6% of the worker's salary. For a worker who takes full advantage of the company match, the employer's contribution represents 3% of his or her pay, or $1,500 a year for a worker making $50,000. 
The company contribution for an executive version of a 401(k) is typically 60% higher. The average company contributes 5%, and nearly half of the companies surveyed contribute even more, the Mercer study found. 
The dollar amounts contributed can be substantial. Intel Corp. contributed $1.3 million to the defined contribution accounts of its top five executives in 2000, including nearly $400,000 to the account of Chief Executive Craig R. Barrett, whose salary and bonuses that year totaled $3.4 million. But unlike many other firms, Intel makes such contributions for all of the about 10,000 employees whose ability to contribute to the regular 401(k) is restricted, Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy said. 
* Huge low-cost loans. SEC filings show telecom company Global Crossing Ltd., which filed for bankruptcy protection this week, made an $8-million loan to then-Chief Executive Thomas J. Casey in November 2000 and a $1.8-million loan to President David Walsh in March 2001. Both loans were secured by the executives' homes, but the interest rates they paid--6.01% for Casey, 4.75% for Walsh--were three to four percentage points below prevailing rates on standard home equity loans at the time. 
Enron's former chief executive, Kenneth L. Lay, frequently tapped a $7.5-million line of credit he could repay with company stock that Enron had given him or that he had purchased with low-cost company-provided options. His predecessor, Jeffrey K. Skilling, was given a $2-million loan. Enron had offered to forgive the payments if Skilling stayed with the company until Dec. 31, 2001, but he resigned Aug. 14. 
* Lavish life insurance. Many workers get some life insurance through their employers--typically $50,000 or one year's pay. 
Executives can get much more. About one-quarter of companies in the Mercer study have special executive life insurance programs that typically pay for coverage equal to three to four times the executives' annual pay. 
Sometimes the benefit is much higher. In 2000, Cendant Corp., a travel and real estate company, paid $3.7 million in premiums on a $100-million life insurance policy for its chief executive, Henry R. Silverman, 60. Under the arrangement, known as a split-dollar policy, Cendant will recoup its premiums from the life insurance proceeds when Silverman dies, with Silverman's heirs receiving the rest of the money, according to Cendant's latest SEC filing. 
* Company-paid taxes. Companies pay a variety of tax bills for certain executives. When benefits are so great that they incur a tax bill from the IRS--as they often do--some executives are given money to pay the tax. Because that cash payment also incurs income tax, companies often add an additional sum to cover the extra tax--a process known as "grossing up." 
Lucent Chairman Henry B. Schacht was given $57,325 to pay tax on "certain fringe benefits" in 2000, according to the company's SEC filings. Ray R. Iritani, chief executive of Occidental Petroleum, was reimbursed $486,918 for taxes in 1999--and $95,000 for tax preparation services, SEC filings show. 
* Fringe benefits. Other perks, such as the personal use of corporate jets, company-provided chauffeurs and company-paid financial planning, can add tens of thousands of dollars to an executive's total compensation. 
The footnotes of Lucent's SEC filings show the company paid $26,351 for personal financial planning advice for Schacht in a year in which he received a $1.1-million paycheck. At Enron, Lay's personal use of a corporate jet in 2000 was worth $334,179. 
Shareholder activists note that many of the most lavish arrangements have been uncovered at companies that have since hit hard times--among them Enron, whose compensation philosophy, according to SEC filings, was "to reward executive performance that creates long-term shareholder value." 
"At a minimum, it's inconsistent for companies and executives to just keep feasting" when financial performance falters, stock prices drop and other employees face cutbacks, Richson, of the Wisconsin Investment Board, said. "It's bordering on unethical."

REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)
Scribbler's Ethics

02/01/2002
The Wall Street Journal
A18
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

With the fall of Enron, public and professional ethics are back in the news, including the mores of journalists and including our own. So maybe it's a good time to rescue ethical behavior from the professional ethicists. 
We've come in for criticism lately because one of our contributors, the British conservative writer Roger Scruton, wrote an essay for our European edition while being paid by a Japanese tobacco company. The British Guardian turned up an e-mail in the name of his wife and business partner Sophie to Japan Tobacco proposing an increase in their retainer, in return for placing articles in the "WSJ, the Times, the Telegraph, the Spectator, the Financial Times, the Economist" and so on.
Now, Professor Scruton -- a free-marketeer with well-known views -- was a contributor for us long before he took a dime from Big Tobacco. His point of view is of course precisely why the left-wing Guardian wants to portray him as tainted by filthy lucre. These are the same ethicists who lack the same passion for disclosure when it comes to finding out, for example, whether Ralph Nader is financed by trial lawyers. 
Our own view is that the financing of the advocate matters far less than the quality of the advocacy. But our long-time standard is also that such financial ties should be disclosed, so readers can make up their own minds. Mr. Scruton had an obligation to tell us and his readers about his tobacco financing when he was writing about tobacco issues; he didn't, and so he will be taking a holiday from our pages. 
Meanwhile, the Internet ethicist, Andrew Sullivan, has been denouncing any journalist who's ever taken a dollar from Enron. This includes our contributor Peggy Noonan, who disclosed last week in her OpinionJournal.com column that she billed Enron $250 an hour for 100 to 200 hours of speech-writing work. In other words, she got paid like any other contract employee, which is called business between consenting adults. The first time she wrote about Enron for us was also when she disclosed her Enron fees, so she has nothing to apologize for. 
Certainly not to Mr. Sullivan, who recently wrote a fine piece for this page on the failure of Talk magazine but then without asking re-sold the article to the Times of London, which didn't bother to give us credit. Mr. Sullivan's explanation is that he didn't think we had international publication rights, although The Wall Street Journal Europe is distributed in London. Leaving aside the fine points of copyright law, Mr. Sullivan's behavior may not have been "unethical" but it wasn't very nice. 
Which brings us to a larger point this page has often made about conflicts of interest and honesty. Avoiding the first is not the same as the latter; sometimes persnickety rules can become a license for larger dishonesty. So, for example, the U.S. Senate poses as a more honest place because it passes a ban on accepting gifts. But then New Jersey Senator Bob Torricelli is able to evade the ban by claiming that the Italian suits he received from a campaign contributor were from a "friend," a legal loophole. 
The same applies to intellectual honesty in journalism. At least Mr. Scruton, whatever his disclosure oversight, took money from people he agrees with. But New York Times columnist Paul Krugman has recently given himself a free ethical pass because he says he disclosed his former Enron ties once he became a columnist. 
Mr. Krugman wrote a puff piece on the company for Fortune magazine while he was getting $50,000 as an Enron adviser, but he now denounces politicians and anyone else close to Enron for "crony capitalism." We'll let our readers judge the ethics of that.

Enron's Influence

FINAL

Despite the accurate reporting of The Post about the nature of the phone call I received from Kenneth Lay on Oct. 11 [front page, Jan. 18], Henry Waxman altered the facts in his op-ed column of Jan. 24. 
Predictably, his misrepresentation has been repeated on television by his national party chairman. This is how falsehoods enter history.
To repeat information that I volunteered earlier, the two-minute phone call with Mr. Lay was solely about the legislative prospects, not the content, of an economic stimulus bill. 
Contrary to Rep. Waxman and Terry McAuliffe, no lobbying occurred. In fact, the provision to make the corporate alternative minimum tax relief retroactive had not even surfaced then, and neither I nor anyone else to my knowledge had even heard of the idea.

FORUM IN NEW YORK: PROTESTERS
Paper Giants As a Voice For Ideas
By ANDREW JACOBS

The New York Times
Page 19, Column 6
c. 2002 New York Times Company

Looking like an arts and crafts teacher who had been dropped into a Fellini film, David Taylor was struggling to clothe a papier-mache giant and simultaneously direct paint-splattered volunteers when yet another reporter asked the question: Were he and his fellow protesters planning to clash with the police over the next few days? Mr. Taylor, a 24-year-old computer programmer from Oakland, Calif., put down the puppet he was wrestling and tried to stifle his indignation. 
''If you want to know what those young crazy radical activists are up to, you've come to the right place,'' he said, glancing around a vast industrial space buzzing with politically minded artisans and packed with their handiwork. ''I'm really getting sick of that question.''
While the police on the streets seemed to be steeling themselves for civic unrest, the atmosphere yesterday morning inside the garage, along the West Side Highway at 57th Street, was anything but martial. The message from Mr. Taylor and two dozen other volunteers was clear: make art, not war. 
There was, however, a looming sense of panic as the hours passed and the afternoon debut of this cardboard pageantry neared. There were robber-baron style top hats bearing the words ''WEF: We Are All En-Wrong'' and beachball-sized wine goblets painted like globes that read ''Earth For Sale.'' A blown-up photograph of Kenneth L. Lay, the former chairman and chief executive of Enron, leaned against a pillar, not far from a row of huge pretzels, an apparent reference to the snack food that recently felled President Bush as he watched a football game. 
Over the past week, scores of volunteers from across the country have been flocking to the space to glue, paint and stitch together props that will animate the street protests accompanying the World Economic Forum. Two New York organizations, Arts in Action and Time's Up, helped put together the makeshift workshop. 
But alongside the levity yesterday afternoon there was an undercurrent of fear. Many of those planning to join the protests said they were worried about the potential for violence at the hands of the police. Others said they were frustrated by journalists' single-minded focus on the potential for Seattle-style disturbances. ''We're not out there to fight with the police,'' said Payal Parekh, 28, an oceanography graduate student from Boston who was helping to organize the puppet making. ''We're trying to get our voices heard but the media is obsessed with security issues.'' 
Whether or not their fears are real, even those organizing the puppet workshop were not taking any chances. Bill DiPaola of Time's Up tried to find a backup location, just in case something were to go awry. ''You can't be too careful about these things,'' he said. 
Still, with the demonstration at the Gap at 54th Street near Fifth Avenue already under way, there were more pressing concerns. Clapping to get the room's attention, someone urged the crowd at the garage to head east and ''help animate the images we created.'' A pickup truck was loaded with props; everyone else took the crosstown bus. Ten minutes later, the truck pulled up to the curb at 54th Street and into the arms of the police. ''I promise there are no rocks or bottles,'' one woman joked to an officer who was visibly suspicious. ''It's just a bunch of goofy puppets.'' After a brief verbal tussle and a few tense moments, the police relented, gave the group five minutes to unload and everyone, it seemed, was happy.

Davis spokesman under fire for stock 
By Amy Chance and Dale Kasler
Bee Staff Writers
(Published July 31, 2001) 
Davis administration spokesman Steve Maviglio acknowledged Monday that he 
bought stock in Calpine Corp. in June, at a time when the company was 
announcing a breakthrough in its bid to build a controversial San Jose power 
plant. 
His disclosure came several days after Gov. Gray Davis dismissed five state 
power purchasers for owning stock in the company and drew new complaints that 
Davis administration officials may have improperly mixed their private 
finances and their public roles. 
Maviglio, now acting as interim communications director for the 
administration, said he put in an "open" order for Calpine stock May 31, 
agreeing to buy 300 shares once the stock hit a certain price. 
He said that threshold was met June 20, the day after an action by the 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission brought down "all energy stock prices 
across the board." 
Maviglio said he bought the stock for his individual retirement account, and 
it has since declined in value. Under terms of the open order, he said, he 
had no control over the exact date of purchase. 
Maviglio touted the company in his role as spokesman to the governor in a 
story published June 27 in The Bee. He said Monday that he was simply 
responding to a reporter's question about the company's positive reputation. 
"They have made a clear commitment to invest in California's future," 
Maviglio said at the time. "Their pricing has been far more reasonable than 
any other generator." 
In the interview, Maviglio also contrasted Calpine and Texas-based 
generators. He said Calpine "took a different tack from the Joe Bobs of the 
world," an apparent reference to Joe Bob Perkins, a senior executive with 
Reliant Energy Inc. of Houston. 
Maviglio acknowledged the stock ownership several days after the 
administration ended its relationship with several energy consultants who 
held stock in energy companies, including Calpine. 
Under pressure from Secretary of State Bill Jones, a Republican who hopes to 
challenge Davis for governor next year, the Davis administration has spent 
several weeks scrambling to answer questions about the stock holdings and 
potential conflicts of its consultants and energy traders. 
Jones said Monday that Maviglio should be fired. 
"These actions are unethical, unconscionable, unacceptable, and heads should 
roll," he said in a statement. He said the Democratic governor should direct 
all of his staff to immediately file updated conflict-of-interest statements 
to reflect current holdings. 
Jones, who last week asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to 
investigate administration consultants for insider trading, also said the 
probe should be expanded "to include all of the governor's staff." 
Federal law and SEC regulations forbid anyone from trading stocks while 
possessing "insider information" -- relevant facts not available to the 
public, according to the SEC. Violations can bring lawsuits and criminal 
prosecution. 
Michael Prozan, a Menlo Park lawyer and expert on insider trading, said the 
prohibition against it originally focused on halting company executives from 
profiting from news before it was disclosed publicly. 
But the laws have been broadened to include others besides company employees. 
Investment bankers, lawyers and journalists have been snared by 
insider-trading crackdowns. 
Davis' office was instrumental earlier this year in paving the way for 
removing barriers to construction of a Calpine plant in San Jose. On May 30, 
after opposing the project for years, San Jose Mayor Ron Gonzales announced 
he had negotiated an agreement addressing his concerns and agreed to support 
construction. 
His action came after Davis in April endorsed the plant's construction and as 
the state Energy Commission threatened to approve it over local objections. 
On June 20, the company announced it had won tentative state approval to 
build the plant. 
Maviglio said he buys many stocks and that Enron Corp. and Calpine are the 
only energy generators among them. He owns 100 shares of Enron stock, which 
he purchased in 1996. 
"I deal with hundreds of California companies just about every day, and this 
was one that I saw that looked like a good investment based on public 
knowledge," he said. "I read six newspapers a day or more, and I know what's 
going on in the world. If there's a standard that I can't invest in something 
that I have general public knowledge of, then I wouldn't have any stocks at 
all." 
Maviglio said that the "open" order he placed meant that he could not have 
used inside information to make his stock purchase. 
"Had I had specific knowledge about a contract being signed or what actually 
happened in the office of the mayor of San Jose ... that would have been 
unrelated," Maviglio said. "There was no timing-based sequence to it." 
Calpine stock, despite the company's considerable success, has slipped in 
recent weeks because of general investor anxiety about the California energy 
crisis. 
The stock, which trades on the New York Stock Exchange, closed at $49.30 on 
May 31, the day Maviglio says he placed the purchase order. The order was 
executed as the stock dipped below $40 on June 20, closing that day at 
$39.85. 
The day before, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission announced a 
price-control plan that investors believed was damaging to generators' 
profits. On Monday, the stock closed at $37.13. 
Last week, the Davis administration stopped doing business with five energy 
traders under contract with the administration after Maviglio said 
administration lawyers "came to the determination that there are possible 
violations of the law or close to it." 
"It's not a crime to own energy stock," Maviglio said Monday. "The difference 
with these traders is they're making governmental decisions. They're 
committing the state's resources by spending money to buy power." 
Jim Knox, director of California Common Cause, said he believes the 
Governor's Office made critical errors while hiring staff to purchase energy 
for the state. 
"Had the Governor's Office gone to the trouble to have these people fill 
statements of economic interest, as they were required to do by law, they 
should have known this before they were hired and they shouldn't have been 
hired," Knox said.

Davis energy aide leaves -- without pay 
By Emily Bazar
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published July 31, 2001) 
A high-paid consultant to Gov. Gray Davis who came under fire for his 
dealings with a California utility has cut ties with the administration and 
won't be paid for work already completed. 
Under terms of a settlement made final Monday, former Clinton damage control 
specialist Chris Lehane will no longer help shape Davis' public response to 
the energy crisis. 
Neither Lehane nor partner Mark Fabiani -- who were hired by Davis in May on 
a six-month, $30,000-a-month contract -- will receive any money for their 
services. Fabiani left last month. 
Because Lehane and Fabiani each received at least $10,000 under contract with 
Southern California Edison in the past year, Lewis Uhler, president of the 
National Tax Limitation Committee, filed a lawsuit alleging that conflict of 
interest laws had been violated. 
But Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said Lehane and Fabiani were instrumental 
in persuading the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to limit the wholesale 
cost of power in the state. 
"Chris Lehane provided an invaluable service to the people of California in 
helping us get action after a yearlong wait from FERC," he said. "It's a 
shame that politics gets in the way of public service." 
Uhler, however, said he believes Lehane and Fabiani represent a larger 
problem in the Davis administration, and he pointed to the recent dismissal 
of energy traders who held stock in energy companies. 
"Doesn't anybody in the Governor's Office understand conflict of interest?" 
Uhler asked. 
"This is really sending a signal that the Governor's Office thinks that it is 
somehow above the law."

Power delivery efficiency questioned: Output at low-cost generating plants

California is sometimes deliberately cutting output from low-cost power 
plants while running more expensive ones, utility and grid officials say. 
The sporadic episodes haven't cost much yet, but they illustrate a 
potentially troubling disconnect in the system that has quickly grown between 
two agencies that help deliver electricity to a power-strapped state. 
"We seem to be building this inefficiency into the system, and it doesn't 
seem to be getting better," said Mike Florio, a consumer advocate who sits on 
the governing board of the Independent System Operator. 
The trouble is that the ISO, created in 1996 to manage the power grid in a 
deregulated electric market, tries to run the grid by auctions that -- in 
theory -- provide the cheapest electricity for the state's consumers. 
Meanwhile, the state Department of Water Resources, which in January stepped 
in to buy power on behalf of cash-strapped utilities, isn't bidding at some 
auctions because it believes it can provide cheaper power if it doesn't. 
"We have an inefficient market and an inept government entity. It's sort of 
the worst of both worlds," Florio said, criticizing his agency and the DWR. 
ISO staffers decline to discuss the situation in detail, saying it involves 
confidential bidding behavior. 
But Pete Garris, chief of operations for the power-buying arm of the 
Department of Water Resources, confirmed that the ISO has been asking his 
agency to take part in more auctions, but the state has declined. 
The state's role is to buy electricity for customers of utilities whose 
credit was no longer good enough to buy on their own, he said. 
"We're not in it to do those kinds of marketing functions," he said. "It's 
not necessarily a good fit." 
Some of the ISO auctions are used to lessen congestion on transmission lines. 
Others are used to stabilize the grid by slightly increasing or decreasing 
output when demand doesn't match forecasts. 
Generally, the highest-cost power plants should be the ones cutting back, a 
process the industry calls "decking." 
But since May, on ISO orders, Southern California Edison has repeatedly 
throttled back on the Mohave Generating Station, which produces some of the 
cheapest power available to California today, costing as little as $10 to $20 
a megawatt-hour. 
Edison, which owns a majority share of Mohave, has cut its output by 5,660 
megawatt-hours between May and July, about one-half of 1 percent, at the 
ISO's behest, according to data Edison provided to The Bee. 
The ISO could probably have saved the state's consumers $370,000 at one plant 
if it had asked a higher-cost gas-burning plant to cut back instead of 
Mohave, a coal-burning workhorse in Laughlin, Nev., Florio said. 
The amount sounds like "small potatoes," but in some ways it is more alarming 
than the $14 million the state lost recently by selling excess power for less 
than it paid, he said. 
Industry experts agree that such below-cost sales are common in a business 
where power needs fluctuate dramatically based on the weather. 
By contrast, "this is a dead weight loss. Higher costs are being incurred for 
no good reason," Florio said. 
"The question is, why is the ISO calling on Mohave and not (cheaper) gas 
plants? The answer is, the gas plants aren't bidding ... probably because 
they're contracted with DWR," he said. 
Four Corners, another low-cost coal plant partly owned by Edison, has also 
been throttled back at ISO request, Edison officials said. 
In addition, so few bidders have shown up at ISO auctions to ease stress on 
transmission lines that the system has fallen into disarray, with the ISO 
instead ordering across-the-board power production cuts that are boosting 
costs, Florio said. 
For its part, the ISO will say only that "we are making the most economical 
decisions we can based on the bids available," said spokeswoman Stephanie 
McCorkle. 
DWR's Garris said the state and the ISO have been meeting repeatedly on 
bidding and other coordination issues, and he hopes to have a 
smoother-running system in place by next summer.

Davis: FERC excluding $5 billion of owed refunds 
By Jim Sanders
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published July 31, 2001) 
A ruling by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission last week could cost 
Californians $5 billion in energy refunds, according to Gov. Gray Davis, who 
filed a formal request Monday for a rehearing in the case. 
Although the commission's order suggested that California is owed refunds 
because of exorbitant electricity prices during the recent energy crisis, the 
order's fine print placed severe limits on such refunds, Davis said. 
"FERC is up to its old tricks again," he said. "They talk about refunds for 
California. But in this case, talk really is cheap: The details of its latest 
order show it has no intention of making California whole." 
Tamara Young-Allen, a FERC spokeswoman, declined comment Monday and said the 
agency does not discuss pending cases. 
California is seeking $8.9 billion in alleged overcharges for electricity 
purchased from May 2000 to June 19, when FERC imposed new rules to prevent 
price gouging. 
On Wednesday, FERC ordered hearings to determine precisely how much money 
electricity generators would have to pay in refunds to California. 
At the time, Davis applauded FERC's ruling, saying it validates California's 
claim that "significant refunds are due" and that the agency's action "gets 
us closer to realizing that refund." 
But after poring over details of the 40-page order, state officials said 
Monday that it excludes from consideration more than half the amount sought 
by the state -- leaving $3.9 billion in dispute. 
Attorney Barry Goode and Nancy McFadden, key members of Davis' energy team, 
said the FERC order would not allow refunds: 
For about $2 billion in alleged overcharges stemming from electricity 
purchased by Californians between May and October of last year. 
For electricity bought by the state Department of Water Resources from 
private companies this year. The state says it is owed about $3 billion from 
such purchases. 
The FERC ruling means that only DWR's purchases through the state's 
now-defunct Power Exchange or through the operator of a statewide electricity 
transmission grid will be considered for refunds, officials said. 
Such limitations by the regulatory agency are impractical because the market 
was dysfunctional, leaving DWR with few options, when the state began buying 
electricity for debt-strapped private utilities in January, Goode said. 
"Now FERC says Californians are not entitled to refunds even though they 
determined the prices were excessively high," Davis said. "It's time for FERC 
to decide who they are working for: the greedy out-of-state generators or the 
people of California." 
The motion filed Monday sets the stage for a possible lawsuit. 
"We are calling on FERC to change its order," Davis said. "If it doesn't, we 
will be in court."

Bill would streamline the path to local power: More cities, including Davis, 
are taking a look at creating municipal utility districts. 
By Ed Fletcher
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published July 31, 2001) 
With the future of California's investor-owned utilities clouded by the 
state's energy crisis, more and more cities, including Davis, are looking to 
control their own power destinies. 
Cities, public-power advocates and state Sen. Nell Soto, D-Pomona, are 
pushing a bill through the state Legislature that would make it easier to 
create municipal utility districts. 
"My solution to the power crisis is to reassert our interests and declare our 
independence from out-of-state gougers and in-state irresponsible utility 
companies," said Soto, who is carrying the bill, SB 23xx. 
The Senate approved the bill earlier this month. The Assembly is expected to 
take it up when the Legislature reconvenes in mid-August. The state's three 
investor-owned utilities are fighting the proposal. 
Davis and other cities look longingly at the Sacramento Municipal Utility 
District's success in sheltering ratepayers from the brunt of rate increases. 
Given the cloudy financial future of Davis' power provider, Pacific Gas and 
Electric Co., public power supporters say it's easy to understand why cities 
want local control. If run well, public power can be cheaper and more stable 
than that supplied by investor-owned utility companies, they say. 
"You get to choose the type of energy you want. ... I can't think of a bad 
reason" to have public power, said Robert Milbrodt, a Davis resident active 
in the drive. 
After Yolo County officials last year denied an effort to form a public power 
authority in Davis, the city is ready to take a fresh look. The city, which 
did not formally support last year's attempt, this week is expected to name 
members to a public power task force. It is also hiring a consultant to help 
evaluate the pros and cons of a Davis version of SMUD. 
Soto's bill would create a path to public power that takes county local 
agency formation commissions out of the process. Under the bill, if all the 
cities and counties affected by the proposed municipal utility district sign 
on, the plan bypasses the local LAFCO, goes directly to the California Pubic 
Utilities Commission for analysis and then to the voters of the affected 
areas. 
It was the Yolo County Local Agency Formation Commission that turned down the 
Davis request a year ago, saying critical issues were unresolved. Davis 
public power activists said their plan would have put the basic formation 
question before the voters, leaving the details to be worked out later. 
Public power boosters said lobbying by PG&E doomed their plans. 
SB 23xx also simplifies the approval process, allowing a simple majority of 
voters in the proposed district to create the new power district. 
Seizing transformers, power lines and other utility company infrastructure 
through eminent domain would become much easier for agencies starting 
municipal utility districts under the bill. A utility company would not be 
able to challenge the taking of property based on the merits, but could only 
fight over price. 
The utility companies say the provision would take away a key protection 
against abuse. 
Surveys show Californians like the idea of local officials controlling their 
power, in part because they blame investor-owned utilities for the state's 
electricity mess. 
Nearly two-thirds say local governments taking the place of investor-owned 
utilities would be a good thing, according to a poll released earlier this 
month by the Public Policy Institute of California. 
There are those that warn, however, that pubic power is not without risk. 
"This bill does not address generation," said Dale Hunter, a PG&E lobbyist, 
and municipal utility districts that can't generate their own power will be 
"exposing ratepayers to the volatility of the (power purchasing) market." 
In Los Angeles, the Department of Water and Power has been highly successful 
because it has surplus power to sell, Hunter said. SMUD has only recently 
been forced to raise its rates largely because it generates some of its 
power, Hunter said. 
By creating a way around LAFCOs, shifting the Public Utilities Commission to 
an advisory role and stripping the right of utility companies to fight in 
court, the bill would be removing important public safeguards, Hunter said.

SDG&E denies it deceived ratepayers about debt  


\
objattph 
Company calls gain on sales, debts 'separate transactions' By Craig D. Rose  
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER  July 31, 2001  San Diego Gas & Electric yesterday 
denied allegations that it systematically lied about the debt it racked up 
during the power crisis, despite revelations that the company earned hundreds 
of millions from some power sales.  SDG&E and its parent company, Sempra 
Energy, acknowledged making profits from selling electricity but insisted 
those gains have no bearing on the $750 million debt the utility claims to be 
owed by customers for power purchases during the energy crisis.  "Those are 
completely separate transactions," said Ed Van Herik, a spokesman for SDG&E. 
The company's effort to seal a deal with the state to clear the $750 million 
debt has come under attack by the Utility Consumers' Action Network. The San 
Diego-based consumer group says SDG&E's claimed debt is the result of 
selective bookkeeping, bordering on fraud.  The bottom line, says UCAN, is 
that SDG&E engaged in deception and probably owes its customers money.  
SDG&E, which claimed to have sold customers electricity without markups, 
actually "was buying electricity at a low price and selling it at a higher 
price to us," said Shames. "SDG&E customers have been systematically lied to 
over the past year about this balancing account."  UCAN says that SDG&E 
earned an estimated $450 million from its power sales to the state, while 
publicly declaring that it was posting only losses from buying power.  Shames 
said much of the information leading to UCAN's conclusion came from a 
detailed analysis of documents made available in recent weeks.  The state 
Office of Ratepayer Advocates, meanwhile, yesterday said a new filing by 
SDG&E that claims its power-sales profits belong to stockholders, not 
consumers, is "specious" and "without merit."  Van Herik insisted the company 
had not been misleading. The spokesman noted that the company earlier was 
required to buy electricity from the Power Exchange, a now-defunct 
marketplace established by the state as part of its deregulation plan.  "What 
we said is that we were buying electricity for our customers and passing 
along the cost without markup," said Van Herik.  What SDG&E failed to 
publicly announce was that it was simultaneously selling electricity to the 
Power Exchange for an apparently healthy profit.  Under certain contracts, 
SDG&E had locked in electricity at prices substantially below going rates 
during the ongoing power crisis. The company declined yesterday to reveal 
terms of the contracts. But UCAN estimates the contracts provided electricity 
to the utility at no more than 5 cents per kilowatt-hour.  SDG&E then sold 
that relatively cheap power to the Power Exchange for a higher price and 
pocketed the profit, which it also declined to disclose.  As it profited from 
the power sales, SDG&E bought power at higher prices from the exchange and 
billed customers for what it paid.  Whenever SDG&E's costs to buy electricity 
exceeded what state regulators would allow the utility to charge customers, 
it recorded the amounts in balancing accounts. That account grew to $750 
million.  But SDG&E never offset its losses from electricity purchases with 
its profit from sales.  Van Herik said the practice was appropriate because 
the lucrative contracts for cheap power were owned by the company's 
shareholders, not its customers. The practice of keeping profits and losses 
entirely separate, he said, was endorsed by a California Public Utilities 
Commission audit.  But the first formal ruling on that matter came in June, 
when the full commission ruled that all profits from SDG&E's contractual 
power deals belong to its customers.  SDG&E went to court to overturn the 
commission's ruling, but put the legal effort on hold shortly before Sempra 
reached a tentative agreement with the state to clear the $750 million debt. 
The proposal with the state would reverse the utilities commission ruling and 
award the company's shareholders ownership of the profits SDG&E made from 
selling power.  Van Herik said yesterday that the state made the concession 
because it recognized that SDG&E had a strong legal case.  But Shames says 
the state had a strong case and noted that the Office of Ratepayer Advocates 
agreed. He is asking the utilities commission to reject the deal.  State Sen. 
Steve Peace, D-El Cajon, said he believes that consumer objections to the 
balancing account deal are aimed at getting ratepayers a better deal -- and 
that's something he supports.  "If Michael Shames can improve on the 
balancing account deal I'm in full support as long as we don't lose any of 
the gains we've already gotten," he said.  A spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis 
did not return a telephone call seeking reaction to the UCAN allegations.  
Outside UCAN's office in Little Italy yesterday, a group of trade unionists 
demonstrated in support of SDG&E's position. Dave Moore, a business manager 
for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 465, said SDG&E 
has handled its power purchases in accordance with utilities commission 
rulings.  But Shames said the company sought to shield its actions from the 
scrutiny of consumer groups and the public.  "They consistently said they 
were not making money from this," said the consumer advocate. "For them to 
split hairs and say, 'We didn't make money from purchases, we made it from 
sales,' is disingenuous."  Staff writer Bill Ainsworth contributed to this 
report. 







Sempra set to unveil plans for new plant, business park  


\
objattph 
By Jonathan Heller  UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER  July 31, 2001  ESCONDIDO -- 
City officials are expecting to get their first look today at long-awaited 
plans to build the largest power plant in North County since the Encina plant 
came on line more than 30 years ago.  Sempra Energy Resources will file a 
200-page application with the city Planning Department for a 550-megawatt, 
natural gas-fired power plant and roughly 100-acre business park in southwest 
Escondido, Sempra spokesman Tom Murnane said.  "It (the application) is very 
detailed," Murnane said. "We have not done an application of this sort 
before. This is the first time Sempra Energy Resources has been involved in 
the development of a business park."  Sempra is building the project in 
partnership with JRM Real Estate, a Carlsbad-based developer.  The California 
Energy Commission will have final say on the power plant, which could take 
three to four years to get on line. The City Council will decide on the 
industrial park.  City officials have awaited Sempra's bid ever since the 
idea was broached in January. The project addresses two needs: The power 
plant would provide enough energy to power almost a half-million homes, and 
the business park would bring higher-paying jobs to a city with the lowest 
median income in North County.  "I'm awaiting with great anticipation to see 
what they have planned," said City Councilwoman June Rady. "I have met with 
Sempra officials several times in the past and what they have shared with me 
I've been very excited about."  Sempra has promised that its proposed plant 
would have lower emission levels than any plant now in the state. The company 
also has said the plant would not have a tall smokestack, or a visible vapor 
plume such as the one produced by the city's Iceoplex generating plant.  The 
plant and park are slated for Quail Hills, the last large parcel of vacant 
industrial land in the city. Several previous plans by other developers have 
failed after they discovered the high costs involved with building on the 
hilly terrain.  Neighbors near the area have voiced concerns about noise, 
traffic and dust associated with rock crushing, which would be needed to 
create level foundations for the project.






Davis press secretary confirms buying energy company stock  


\
objattph 
ASSOCIATED PRESS  July 31, 2001  SACRAMENTO ) Gov. Gray Davis' press 
secretary recently purchased the same energy stock as five consultants the 
governor fired last week, he disclosed Monday.  Steve Maviglio confirmed that 
on June 20, he bought 300 shares of stock in Calpine Corp., a San Jose-based 
power generator that has received about $13 billion in state contracts to 
supply electricity for up to 20 years.  Maviglio's disclosure comes after 
Davis' office hastily ended the contracts of five consultants who helped 
negotiate state power contracts and held stock in energy companies.  In a 
related development, an anonymous source told the Los Angeles Times on Monday 
that the Securities and Exchange Commission has launched a preliminary 
inquiry into whether the consultants used inside information to trade the 
energy stocks.  About two dozen Davis energy consultants were required to 
fill out financial disclosure statements after complaints of conflict of 
interest by Republicans and consumer groups.  "When we reviewed them, we 
found possible violations of the law and took swift action," Maviglio said 
Monday before Secretary of State Bill Jones issued a press release calling 
for his termination.  Jones, a Republican, is a candidate for the GOP 
nomination to challenge Davis in November 2002.  Maviglio defended his 
purchase, saying that he "owns several stocks in companies in all fields that 
are growing and are based in California."  Maviglio said Monday that he 
requested on May 31 to purchase the stock if it dipped to $40 a share, which 
it did two days after a June 18 ruling by federal energy regulators 
restricting wholesale electricity prices in California and 10 other states.  
Maviglio served as Davis' chief spokesman urging the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission to impose price ceilings on electricity wholesalers.  
He also said he owns between $10,000 and $100,000 stock in Houston-based 
Enron Corp. He said he purchased the stock in 1997 and has reported it on 
financial disclosure forms. He said that it is "closer to $10,000."  
Meanwhile, two energy consultants to Davis have agreed to forgo more than 
$50,000 in work they did for the state.  Chris Lehane and Mark Fabiani will 
forgo the payments as part of a settlement with a Sacramento-area resident 
who filed a lawsuit objecting to their hiring, calling it a conflict of 
interest.  Fabiani could not be reached for comment Monday. In the 
settlement, they admitted no wrongdoing.  Lehane issued a statement through 
the governor's office, calling it "simply not worth the bother to challenge 
the controller in court."  Davis has come under fire for his May hiring of 
Lehane, former press secretary for Vice President Al Gore, and Fabiani, a 
deputy campaign manager for Gore's presidential run.  They were hired to help 
shape Davis' response to the energy crisis, and helped craft Davis' 
aggressive attack on Texas-based energy companies and President Bush.  Both 
also have advised Southern California Edison, which is negotiating for state 
help in avoiding bankruptcy. Financial disclosure forms showed they have each 
received at least $10,000 from Edison in the past year.  Davis announced at 
the end of June that Fabiani terminated his contract, and Davis scaled back 
Lehane's role with the state.  State Controller Kathleen Connell then said 
she would not pay Lehane and Fabiani for any of their work and now the two 
have agreed they will not fight her decision, Maviglio said.  Lewis K. Uhler, 
the Placer County man who filed the lawsuit, said the settlement 
"accomplished our objectives."  "We wanted to block the egregious use of 
taxpayer funds for essentially political spinmeisters," he said. Uhler is 
president of the Roseville-based National Tax Limitation Committee.  Maviglio 
said that Fabiani and Lehane "did good work for the state" and helped the 
state win victories with federal regulators. 






THE STATE
Davis' Energy Advisors Draw SEC Attention
Probe: Under review is the possible use of inside information to buy power 
company stocks. GOP rival of governor requested the inquiry.
By WALTER HAMILTON JEFFERY L. RABIN and DARYL KELLEY
TIMES STAFF WRITERS

July 31 2001

The Securities and Exchange Commission has launched a preliminary inquiry 
into whether energy consultants advising Gov. Gray Davis used inside 
information to trade stocks of power companies doing business with the state, 
a source with knowledge of the matter said Monday.

The federal agency began its review late last week, the source said, in 
response to a request from California Secretary of State Bill Jones. A 
Republican rival of Davis, Jones charged that stock trading by consultants 
may have violated federal laws barring buying and selling based on 
information not available to the public.

On Friday, top aides to the governor disclosed that five consultants had been 
fired for possible conflicts of interest between their official positions and 
their personal finances. As news of the SEC inquiry spread through the 
capital Monday, Davis officials were confronted by a flurry of questions 
about who in the administration owns energy stocks.

Financial disclosure records filed by the governor's spokesman, Steve 
Maviglio, show that he owns between $10,000 and $100,000 in a Texas company 
he and his boss have accused of making "obscene" profits while California has 
been "on its knees." Maviglio said he bought the shares in Houston-based 
Enron Corp. in 1996.

"It's not a crime to own energy stock," Maviglio said.

He also owns 300 shares of San Jose-based Calpine Corp., which has the 
largest share of the $43 billion in long-term state power contracts.

Maviglio placed the order for the stock on May 31, one day after San Jose's 
mayor dropped his opposition to a controversial Calpine plant favored by the 
governor and others. Under the terms of Maviglio's purchase, the transaction 
was completed about three weeks later when the stock reached $40 a share, a 
value of $12,000. It has since fallen in value.

"I viewed it as a good long-term investment," Maviglio said, adding that he 
purchased the shares for his retirement account based on publicly available 
information.

The Davis administration has spared Calpine the kind of fierce criticisms 
that it has leveled at other electricity suppliers, such as Enron. But 
California's grid operator has identified the company as one of many energy 
merchants to overcharge the state millions of dollars.

The fired consultants also owned shares in Calpine, ranging in value from 
several thousand dollars to more than $100,000, records show.

Another top Davis administration official, legal affairs secretary Barry 
Goode, disclosed in his economic interest statement that he recently held 
between $100,000 and $1 million in another out-of-state company accused of 
multimillion-dollar price gouging.

In a statement, Goode said he sold his stock in Williams Co's. a month after 
he began working for the governor in February. Goode said the shares were 
supposed to be sold before he went on the state payroll, but his broker 
failed to do so.

In light of the recent disclosures, Secretary of State Jones said the 
governor must do more to ensure the public that its interest comes first.

"The governor should direct all of his staff to immediately file updated 
conflict of interest statements that reflect current holdings and any 
activity since their last statement of economic interest was filed," said 
Jones, who is seeking the GOP nomination for governor.

Word of the SEC's entry into California's energy problems comes as the 
governor faces harsh criticism from lawmakers and others for the quick and 
broad hiring of highly paid private consultants to guide him through the 
crisis.

In his written request to the SEC, Jones said that recently filed disclosure 
documents showed that at least one consultant bought and sold shares of two 
energy companies within the same month, raising "a red flag" about the 
possibility of insider trading.

State law prohibits officials from participating in decisions involving their 
personal financial interests.

The five consultants fired last week were among 11 named in Jones' letter, 
delivered to the San Francisco office of the SEC last Wednesday. It was not 
clear which individuals are the focus of the SEC's inquiry, or whether the 
agency's review would result in any charges.

Two of the former traders said Monday that they had not been contacted by 
federal investigators and knew nothing of an inquiry into possible insider 
trading.

But William Mead, fired Thursday, said it is no mystery why so many of his 
colleagues owned Calpine stock.

Mead said he bought it 2 1/2 years ago and made so much money he recommended 
it to his colleagues last year, while they all still worked for the 
now-defunct California Power Exchange in Alhambra. Calpine power was not 
traded on that exchange, so there was no conflict of interest, he said.

Mead and three other energy traders--hired by the state in February and 
March--were terminated by the Davis administration for allegedly buying power 
for the state from Calpine while owning the company's stock. Fired traders 
Herman Leung, Peggy Cheng and Constantine Louie did not list the date of 
their Calpine purchases on financial statements that the state required to be 
filed only two weeks ago.

"But I'm sure they bought it while they were still at the power exchange, 
because that's when we discussed it," Mead said. "It was kind of like a 
hobby. I'm sure it wasn't done with the intent to manipulate."

Former trader Elaine Griffin, who also owned Calpine stock and resigned two 
weeks ago to take another job, said she didn't know she owned energy 
securities until she checked with her financial advisor July 13, just before 
leaving her state job.

Griffin said she and her husband own about $10,000 worth of Calpine stock in 
individual retirement accounts managed by their advisor, who bought the stock 
Feb. 1 without their knowledge, she said, after research found it to be a 
good investment.

"I kind of feel like we've been used for political reasons," Griffin said. 
"We would have disclosed anything right at first, but they never asked."

As a trader, Griffin said she occasionally bought Calpine power for the 
state, but only at market prices.

Meanwhile, two Democratic political consultants, who helped Davis polish his 
image after the ongoing energy crisis caused his poll numbers to plummet, 
have agreed to accept no payment for their work as part of an out-of-court 
settlement of a taxpayer lawsuit.

Tom Hiltachk, a lawyer for conservative anti-tax activist Lewis Uhler, said 
the settlement was reached last Friday after negotiations with lawyers for 
communications consultants Mark Fabiani and Chris Lehane.

"Now they will not receive one red cent," said Hiltachk. "Very simply Mr. 
Fabiani and Mr. Lehane have agreed to cease all activities for the governor, 
to accept no payments for their services and to basically get out of the 
consulting business with the governor."

As his part of the agreement, Hiltachk said, Uhler withdrew his lawsuit 
Monday morning.

Uhler had filed a lawsuit against the two consultants and Controller Kathleen 
Connell in June contending that they should not receive any payments because 
of a conflict of interest. The two men also did consulting work for 
financially troubled Southern California Edison, which was seeking help from 
Davis and the Legislature.

Connell, a former Los Angeles mayoral candidate who has been at odds with 
Davis since he endorsed an opponent, had held up the payments pending the 
outcome of the lawsuit.

Under an agreement with Davis, the men were to have been paid $30,000 a month 
for six months.

Fabiani and Lehane could not be reached for comment.

(07-31) 07:23 PDT SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- 
Gov. Gray Davis' press secretary says he owns stock in the same energy 
company as five state consultants who were fired because of possible conflict 
of interest. 
Steve Maviglio confirmed Monday that on June 20 he bought 300 shares of stock 
in Calpine Corp., a San Jose-based power generator that has received about 
$13 billion in state contracts to supply electricity for up to 20 years. 
Secretary of State Bill Jones called for Maviglio's termination. Jones is a 
candidate for the GOP nomination to challenge Davis in November 2002. 
The five energy consultants were fired last week because they owned shares in 
Calpine and also had helped the state buy electricity from the company. "We 
did not want them making governmental decisions and holding these stocks," 
said Barry Goode, the governor's legal affairs secretary. 
An anonymous source told the Los Angeles Times on Monday that the Securities 
and Exchange Commission has launched a preliminary inquiry into whether the 
consultants used inside information to trade energy stocks. 
Maviglio defended his investment, saying that he "owns several stocks in 
companies in all fields that are growing and are based in California." 
He said he had arranged to buy Calpine stock if it dipped to $40 a share, 
which it did two days after a June 18 ruling by federal energy regulators 
restricting wholesale electricity prices in California and 10 other states. 
Calpine stock closed Monday at $37.13. 
Maviglio had served as Davis' chief spokesman urging the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission to impose price ceilings on electricity wholesalers. 
He also said he owns stock worth $10,000 to $100,000 in Houston-based Enron 
Corp., the nation's largest power wholesaler. He said he bought the stock in 
1997 and has reported it on financial disclosure forms. He said his holding 
is "closer to $10,000."

PG&E's $500,000,000 second-quarter surprise

PG&E Corp. said yesterday that it will earn $500 million to $600 million more 
than anticipated in the second quarter because its bankrupt utility was able 
to buy cheaper electricity in March as wholesale prices dropped. 
As a consequence, PG&E reduced the amount of money it says the utility, 
Pacific Gas and Electric Co., lost during California's energy crisis from 
$5.2 billion to between $4.6 billion and $4.7 billion. 
"Its a good thing for PG&E," said Paul Fremont, an energy industry analyst 
with Jefferies & Co., an investment bank in New York. "But it clearly does 
not get them to the level where they are able to emerge from bankruptcy and 
make all of their creditors whole." 
The disclosure by PG&E Corp. yesterday adds a modest boost to its quarterly 
earnings report, set for tomorrow morning. The company is expected to report 
an operating profit of 71 cents per share, according to analysts polled by 
Thomson Financial/First Call, an investment research firm. 
PG&E Corp. is the owner of Pacific Gas & Electric Co., which filed for 
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April after electricity prices soared 
this year. The utility had previously estimated that it lost $1.1 billion in 
the first quarter and $4.1 billion in the fourth because it was prohibited by 
the state Public Utilities Commission from passing higher costs on to 
consumers. 
PG&E Corp. also includes a energy producing unit, which generally makes 
money, and a venture capital arm. Neither of those divisions is affected by 
the utility's bankruptcy. 
The utility said it got a small break in March as the price it was paying to 
the California Independent System Operator for energy declined sharply. The 
unanticipated drop was attributed to declining demand because of energy 
conservation, low tempera- 
tures and the opening of new power plants in the state. 
The utility also benefited from the cancellation of power contracts by 
companies that did not want to do business with a bankrupt partner. Those 
contracts were for selling power at below cost. 
What is the utility's gain, though, may be a negative for PG&E's power- 
producing division. The lower prices could mean the energy-producing group 
will make less money from its sales, analysts said.

ED133454.DTL>
GOV. GRAY DAVIS seems to have an ethical blind spot when it comes to the 
hiring of outsiders to help manage California's energy crisis. 
Throughout the crisis, Davis has been intolerably slow in responding to 
questions about whether certain members of his inner circle -- drawing big 
checks off the public payroll -- might have possible financial conflicts. 
As of yesterday, the governor's office still has not required 16 contractors 
to file public disclosure documents that would reveal whether they have any 
financial stake in companies affected by policies they help develop. 
Steve Maviglio, the governor's press secretary, said 42 energy "consultants" 
have filed their economic disclosure statements. But he said the other 16 
were "contractors" -- without actual decisionmaking authority -- and were 
thus not required to fill out the forms. 
Maviglio's "contractor versus consultant" distinctions are technical and 
semantic. His spin simply doesn't wash. 
The bottom line is that "contractors" who are making big decisions involving 
big dollars for the state are not playing by the same rules as others in the 
public trust. 
For example, Davis has exempted two Wall Street executives, Joseph Fichera 
and Michael Hoffman, who are putting together a rescue plan that involves a 
$12.5 billion bond issue. They are getting $275,000 a month for their advice. 
Yet they have not been required to fill out disclosure forms, which would 
allow the governor -- and any other Californian -- to assess whether a 
potential conflict exists. 
"They told us they don't have any conflicts," said Maviglio, who, 
incidentally, confirmed yesterday that in June he bought $12,000 worth of 
stock in the Calpine Corp., the generating company with the largest chunk of 
state power contracts. On July 2, Davis publicly praised Calpine as "the most 
responsible of the generators." 
Davis should have finally learned his lesson last week after having to fire 
five consultants -- all involved in energy trading -- when their belatedly 
filed disclosure forms showed serious potential conflicts. A sixth consultant 
quit. Four of those traders owned Calpine shares. 
A week earlier, the Davis administration was forced to order a group of 
consultants to hastily unload their power-company holdings or lose their 
contracts. 
The governor's office also has been stung by revelations that political 
consultants Chris Lehane and Mark Fabiani, hired at $30,000 a month to 
develop energy-related "communications strategies," also had a contract with 
Southern California Edison. 
Moreover, some of the disclosure forms that have been filed to date have been 
less than complete, especially regarding the timing of the buying and selling 
of energy stocks. 
How many scandals will it take for Davis to insist on full disclosure -- and 
the highest ethical standards -- of everyone who is working for him on the 
energy crisis?

S.F. to vote on electric power to the people 
Measures would start public utility districts 
Rachel Gordon, Chronicle Staff Writer <mailto:rgordon@sfchronicle.com>

San Francisco -- After decades of trying to persuade San Francisco to take 
control of its electrical system, advocates of public power now have the 
issue before city voters. 
"The timing couldn't be better," said consumer advocate Medea Benjamin, co- 
director of San Francisco's Global Exchange. 
"It's not just the threat of blackouts or the highest rate hikes in history. 
It's the fact that PG&E is in bankruptcy. It's the depletion of the state 
budget," she said. "This is a hell of an opportunity." 
The opportunity she is talking about centers on two November ballot measures 
that would pave the way for creating a public power system and taking Pacific 
Gas and Electric Co. out of the city's electricity market. 
Under the proposed measures, an elected board of directors would set the 
rates and have control over everything from the terms for buying electricity 
to whether to use more renewable energy sources, such as wind, hydroelectric 
and solar power. 
Public power would base policies "on a more localized basis, where the values 
of an individual community can be put into practice," said Ed Smeloff, a 
longtime public power advocate who was recently hired as an assistant general 
manager at the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission. 
One proposal, an initiative placed on the ballot by residents, calls for 
setting up a municipal utility district in San Francisco and neighboring 
Brisbane. The district would be governed by an elected board of directors. 
The other measure, placed on the ballot last week by the Board of 
Supervisors, would create a municipal water and power agency and would affect 
only San Francisco. 
PG&E has mounted a campaign to defeat the measures, so far pumping more than 
$200,000 into the effort. 
"We think the (ballot proposals) are a bad idea," said Frank Gallagher, 
spokesman for the Coalition for Affordable Public Services, the PG&E-financed 
group fighting the measures. "They're confusing and do nothing to address the 
problem." 
The company has a history of opposing public power proposals, derailing a 
plan in Davis in the 1990s and using a legal challenge to stall the start of 
Sacramento's Municipal Utility District for two decades. 
For years, private utilities have enjoyed a powerful hold on state and local 
politicians. But the energy crisis has caused widespread public anger and 
concern, forcing city and state officials to take another look at public 
power. 
A poll conducted this month by the Public Policy Institute of California, a 
nonpartisan think tank in San Francisco, found that nearly two-thirds of 
Californians support the replacement of private electric companies with 
municipal power authorities formed by local governments. 
San Francisco already owns a power system, Hetch Hetchy, which provides power 
for city departments. PG&E provides power to residents and businesses. 
The San Francisco Charter amendment placed on the ballot by the supervisors 
calls for abolishing the city's existing Public Utilities Commission, which 
is run by commissioners and a director appointed by the mayor. The proposed 
public power board would have seven elected directors, but the agency still 
would retain some ties to City Hall. 
The supervisors' plan is intended to be used as a backup to the municipal 
utility district -- commonly known as a MUD -- which is considered to be more 
vulnerable to the expected legal challenges from PG&E. 
"It's a great marriage, and will ensure that we get public power in San 
Francisco," said Board of Supervisors President Tom Ammiano, chief sponsor of 
the board's measure. 
San Francisco is not alone in looking at public power. San Diego, the first 
city to feel the hard pinch of the energy crisis, wants to establish a 
regional public power system in an attempt to pool resources and bring down 
energy costs. 
The East Bay Municipal Utility District, which provides water and sewer 
service, is considering expanding its reach to power. In the Bay Area, the 
cities of Alameda and Palo Alto already have public power. The two largest 
public power agencies in the state serve Los Angeles and Sacramento. 
In San Francisco, the pro-public power forces are going to tout the promised 
virtues of turning the electric utility over to a public authority that by 
law cannot turn a profit. That, they contend, means lower rates. 
"It's an expectation, but it's also tried and true," said Ross Mirkarimi, 
campaign director of MUD Now, the group sponsoring the ballot initiative. 
On average, consumers pay 18 percent less for power from public utilities, he 
said. 
Gallagher, spokesman for the opposition campaign, said ratepayers shouldn't 
assume that public power means lower energy bills. "There's no way the rates 
are going down," he said. 
He blamed the energy crisis not on deregulation but on a shortage of 
electricity, which jacked up prices and undercut reliability. 
"The measures do nothing about supply," Gallagher said. "All this will do is 
cost people money. You can't just take PG&E's assets. You have to pay for 
them."

Davis' advisers probed by SEC 
Published Tuesday, July 31, 2001, in the San Jose Mercury News 
BY WALTER HAMILTON, JEFFERY L. RABIN AND DARYL KELLEY 

Los Angeles Times 


The Securities and Exchange Commission has launched a preliminary inquiry 
into whether energy consultants advising California Gov. Gray Davis used 
inside information to trade stocks of power companies doing business with the 
state, a source with knowledge of the matter said Monday. 
The federal agency began its review late last week, the source said, in 
response to a request from California Secretary of State Bill Jones, who is 
seeking the GOP nomination for governor. Jones charged that stock trading by 
consultants may have violated federal laws barring buying and selling based 
on information not available to the public. 
On Friday, top aides to the governor disclosed that five consultants had been 
fired for possible conflicts of interest between their official positions and 
their personal finances. 
In addition, financial disclosure records filed by the governor's spokesman, 
Steve Maviglio, show that he owns between $10,000 and $100,000 in a Texas 
company he and his boss have accused of making ``obscene'' profits while 
California has been ``on its knees.'' Maviglio said he bought the shares in 
Houston-based Enron Corp. in 1996. 
``It's not a crime to own energy stock,'' Maviglio said. 
Calpine purchase 
He also owns 300 shares of San Jose-based Calpine Corp., which has the 
largest share of the $43 billion in long-term state power contracts. 
Maviglio placed an order for the stock with an electronic broker May 31, one 
day after San Jose Mayor Ron Gonzales dropped his opposition to a 
controversial Calpine plant under pressure from the governor and others. 
Under the terms of Maviglio's instructions, the stock was automatically 
purchased on his behalf when Calpine fell to $40 a share, according Hilary 
McLean, a spokeswoman for the governor. It has since fallen in value. 
``I viewed it as a good long-term investment,'' Maviglio said, adding that he 
purchased the shares for his retirement account based on publicly available 
information. 
The Davis administration has spared Calpine the kind of fierce criticisms it 
has leveled at other electricity suppliers, such as Enron. But California's 
grid operator has identified the company as one of many energy merchants to 
overcharge the state millions of dollars. 
The fired consultants also owned shares in Calpine, ranging in value from 
several thousand dollars to more than $100,000, records show. 
Another top Davis administration official, legal affairs secretary Barry 
Goode, disclosed in his economic interest statement that he recently held 
between $100,000 and $1 million in another out-of-state company accused of 
multimillion-dollar price gouging. 
In a statement, Goode said he sold his stock in Williams Co's. a month after 
he began working for the governor in February. Goode said the shares were 
supposed to be sold before he went on the state payroll but his broker failed 
to do so. 
In light of the recent disclosures, the secretary of state said the governor 
must do more to assure the public that its interest comes first. 
``The governor should direct all of his staff to immediately file updated 
conflict of interest statements that reflect current holdings and any 
activity since their last statement of economic interest was filed,'' Jones 
said. 
Word of the SEC's entry into California's energy problems comes as the 
governor faces harsh criticism from lawmakers and others for the quick and 
broad hiring of highly paid private consultants to guide him through the 
crisis. 
In his written request to the SEC, Jones said that recently filed disclosure 
documents showed that at least one consultant bought and sold shares of two 
energy companies within the same month, raising ``a red flag'' about the 
possibility of insider trading. 
State law prohibits officials from participating in decisions involving their 
personal financial interests. 
The five consultants fired last week were among 11 named in Jones' letter, 
delivered to the San Francisco office of the SEC last Wednesday. It was not 
clear which individuals are the focus of the SEC's inquiry, or whether the 
agency's review would result in any charges. 
Two of the former traders said Monday that they had not been contacted by 
federal investigators and knew nothing of an inquiry into possible insider 
trading. 
But William Mead, fired Thursday, said it's no mystery why so many of his 
colleagues owned Calpine stock. 
Mead said he bought it 2 1/2 years ago and made so much money he recommended 
it to his colleagues last year, while they all still worked for the 
now-defunct California Power Exchange in Alhambra. Calpine was not traded on 
that exchange, so there was no conflict of interest, he said. 
Traders fired 
Mead and three other energy traders -- hired by the state in February and 
March -- were terminated by the Davis administration for allegedly buying 
power from Calpine while owning the company's stock. Fired traders Herman 
Leung, Peggy Cheng and Constantine Louie did not list the date of their 
Calpine purchases on financial statements that the state required to be filed 
only two weeks ago. 
``But I'm sure they bought it while they were still at the power exchange, 
because that's when we discussed it,'' Mead said. ``It was kind of like a 
hobby. I'm sure it wasn't done with the intent to manipulate.''

Ethics issue in stock buy? 
A top Davis aide bought shares in a power company dealing with the state. 
July 31, 2001 
By JOHN HOWARD
The Orange County Register 
SACRAMENTO A top aide to Gov. Gray Davis bought stock in a power company that 
received a long-term contract with the state, the latest in a series of 
energy investments that have cast an ethical cloud over the state's 
electricity purchases. 
Steven Maviglio, Davis' press secretary and acting communications director, 
ordered through his broker 300 shares of San Jose-based Calpine Corp. stock 
May 31, to take effect when it dropped to $40 per share. It dropped below 
that June 20 and Maviglio purchased $12,000 worth, he said. 
Two days earlier, federal regulators had placed a cap on what Calpine and 
other energy producers could charge for energy -- a cap Maviglio had touted 
on behalf of Davis. 
Monday's disclosure of Maviglio's transaction comes just days after Davis 
fired five consultants who were purchasing energy for the state from a 
company whose stock they owned. At the time, Maviglio said it "appeared to us 
there was a possible violation of the law, or very close to it." 
He said his own situation was different, "because they (the five) were 
committing state resources and timing their purchases." The disclosure of his 
transaction, he said, was "clearly a political smear by a desperate 
candidate," referring to Secretary of State Bill Jones, a Republican 
gubernatorial hopeful and rival of Davis. 
Jones said Maviglio "should be fired immediately" and that Davis should order 
all of his staff to immediately file updated conflict-of-interest statements 
to reflect current holdings. 
Maviglio said he would sell the Calpine stock - which closed at $37.13 a 
share Monday - if requested by Davis' legal staff. He said he spoke with 
those lawyers Monday and they had not made that request, nor had he been 
asked to resign. 
A Davis aide, Hilary McLean, said, "Absolutely, the governor has confidence 
in Steve."







Aide denies stock deal was improper 
Maviglio says the June 20 purchase, submitted online, was in the hands of 
others. 
July 31, 2001 
By JOHN HOWARD
The Orange County Register 
SACRAMENTO The governor's chief spokesman denies he committed any impropriety 
by buying Calpine Corp. stock June 20, saying the purchase was actually in 
the hands of others. 
Steven Maviglio said he submitted on May 31 a purchase order through his 
online brokerage to buy 300 shares of Calpine, a San Jose-based power 
generator that has a long-term energy contract with the state. 
"It could have happened an hour after later (after the purchase order), a 
month later or five years later," he said. "Or never." 
But Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a political scientist at Clare mont Graduate 
University, questioned the wisdom of Maviglio's stock transaction. 
"What I find puzzling is that he moved to change the dynamic of his stock in 
the middle of this energy problem, in the middle of the governor's attacks 
and the governor's negotiations," she said. "There ought to have been an 
understanding that even if not illegal, there should have been a perception 
that he shouldn't be involved in playing with stocks." 
The disclosure of the transaction couldn't have come at a worse time for the 
administration, or Maviglio: On Friday, five state energy consultants with 
stock-firm stock were summarily fired and a state lawyer was reassigned to 
another job. Another consultant with similar investments quit July 14 to take 
a private job. 
All were involved in the energy-purchasing program that was launched under an 
emergency order Jan. 17, in which the state began buying power on behalf of 
the strapped utilities, which did not credit to purchase power on their own. 
Dozens of people were directly involved in the energy purchases. 
Earlier in the day Monday, in a separate issue, the governor's office 
disclosed that two key consultants who had been hired to help Davis with his 
public relations had decided to forgo $50,000 in contract fees as part of a 
legal settlement with Davis' critics. 
The two consultants, Chris Lehane and Mark Fabiani, both veterans of the 
Clinton-Gore White House and political campaigns, had been hired in May under 
a $30,000-a month state contract. 
Republicans complained that Davis was using state money to finance political 
operatives. Fabiani left the payroll earlier under pressure; Lehane left this 
month.







Power firms amp up lobbying 
Politics: Edison spends $5.5 million to gain support for bailout to prevent 
bankruptcy. 
July 31, 2001 
By KIMBERLY KINDY
and HANH KIM QUACH
The Orange County Register 
SACRAMENTO Edison International has spent more than $5.5 million this year to 
enlist residents and stockholders to lobby the Legislature to bail out its 
subsidiary Southern California Edison and save it from bankruptcy, reports 
released Monday show. 
The latest financial disclosure statements show that energy companies 
continue to spend millions of dollars to influence the Legislature. Meals, 
campaign contributions and tickets to sporting events continue to flow to 
lawmakers and their staffs. 
Overall, the amount spent on direct lobbying of the Legislature rose slightly 
over last quarter, but gifts and contributions to candidates continued to 
fall. The deadline for statements is today, but many companies and candidates 
filed early. 
Edison's $5.5 million is so far the largest expenditure directed toward an 
orchestrated campaign to influence Capitol politicians. Spokesman Brian 
Bennett said Edison spent the money on television commercials to reach all 
Californians and on a telephone appeal directly to stockholders. 
"This was to educate the public about the dangers of bankruptcy to the 
state's economy and to solicit their support in conveying a message to the 
Legislature that bankruptcy is not an option for the Edison company," Bennett 
said. 
The telephone work involved telling stockholders that the company's value 
would drop if lawmakers did not support a bill to save Edison. Then they 
offered to directly connect the stockholders to lawmakers' offices, asking 
that they tell the lawmakers directly to support the bailout. 
Consumer advocate Doug Heller said Edison's spending - which totaled $5.7 
million for the three-month reporting period and jumped from $318,802 from 
the prior quarter - is out of line. 
"It's amazing that a company teetering on the edge of bankruptcy has millions 
of dollars to throw around to politicians and to create phony grass-roots 
campaigns to influence legislators," said Heller, of the Foundation for 
Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. 
Edison said no contributions were made directly to anyone running for office 
or re-election for this quarter. 
In all, lawmakers sitting on energy committees and who had reported by Monday 
night accepted nearly $61,000 from energy-related companies. 
As of late Monday, Assemblyman Dean Florez, D-Shafter, who sits on the 
Assembly Energy Committee, had received the largest contribution from energy 
companies this quarter, $21,000. 
Seven of the largest power producers that sell electricity to the state spent 
a total of $546,488 on lobbying and other efforts to influence the 
Legislature. 
Topping the list was Calpine Corp., which spent $141,204. Duke Energy came in 
second at $99,735.44 - a $20,000 leap over the prior quarter. Most of Duke's 
money was spent on consultants who worked overtime building a defense for the 
company against accusations of price gouging made by former employees. 
"Overall, our consultants spent more time setting the record straight against 
some blatantly false and misleading statements, regarding our rates and plant 
operations, which the state's own documents proved were false," said Duke 
spokesman Pat Mullen. Some lawmakers and energy experts say the state 
documents do not clear Duke of wrongdoing, and the accusations are still 
being investigated by a Senate committee.






Gouger Gray Davis 
California's petulant governor ignores reality as he overpays for electricity

LANCE T. IZUMI Mr. Izumi is a senior fellow in California Studies at the San 
Francisco- based Pacific Research Institute.
On the surface, things seem to be going pretty good for Gov. Gray Davis with 
regard to California's electricity crisis. The governor has scored some nice 
publicity by switching on some new power plants. The weather has been 
unseasonably cool. His poll numbers are edging back up. Yet beneath this 
optimistic picture lie troubling problems. For example, Davis's argument that 
out-of-state power generators are responsible for the electricity crisis has 
been falling apart. For months, Davis has been claiming that private 
generators have overcharged California by $8.9 billion and demanded that this 
amount be refunded to the state. However, after a two-week mediation between 
state officials and the generators, Curtis Wagner, the federal government's 
chief energy regulatory judge, rebuked Davis's claim saying that such a huge 
overcharge "has not and cannot be substantiated." Further, while the 
generators may be liable to refund a much smaller amount to the state, 
perhaps $1 billion, Wagner said that generators are owed more money by the 
state than they owe the state in refunds: "Can a cash refund be required 
where a much larger amount is due the seller? The chief judge thinks not." 
Davis reacted to the judge's ruling by calling it a "raw deal" and by urging 
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to ignore the lack of evidence and 
the judge's conclusions and to "step up and provide the refunds we've asked 
for." Davis's position, as usual, is motivated purely by politics. Indeed, 
Dan Walters of the Sacramento Bee says that Davis is operating in a 
"melodramatic virtual world" de-linked from reality. 
Davis's blame-the-generators argument took another body blow when newly 
released documents showed that, on average, major out-of-state power 
companies such as Enron, Duke, Dynergy and Mirant charged less than the 
average prices paid by the state during the first three months of the year. 
California government utilities, on the other hand, such as the Los Angeles 
Department of Water and Power and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District 
(SMUD), charged the state much more for electricity than the out-of-state 
generators. For example, while Texas-based Enron, a favorite Davis whipping 
boy, charged an average $181 per megawatt hour, SMUD charged an average $330 
per megawatt hour. 
Davis responded to this revelation in typical political fashion. A Davis 
spokesman said that the governor had expressed his anger at "the generators 
who wear cowboy hats" and that "just because there are other entities that 
are charging us more doesn't change the fact that we are getting ripped off 
by companies from Houston, Tulsa, Atlanta or Charlotte." 
Yet, for all Davis' feigned indignation about consumers being ripped off, it 
turns out that he and his regulators are poised to ensure that business 
consumers are ripped off by state government. Davis has signed $43 billion in 
ill-advised long-term purchase contracts at rates above-market-price. The 
state must, therefore, ensure that enough business customers remain in the 
current state-controlled distribution system to pay for high-priced state 
power purchases. This is especially important to Davis since the high prices 
are borne disproportionately by business. Thus, Davis' regulators are set to 
eliminate "direct access," which allows businesses to shop for cheaper power. 
Who's the real gouger? No matter how much Davis points the finger, 
Californians are paying dearly for his political opportunism and bad 
policies. 







Turning Coal into a tradable commodity
By Rick Stouffer
rstouffer@ftenergy.com <mailto:rstouffer@ftenergy.com>
With the California power debacle offering a neck-snapping jolt, a number of 
states have determined they must offer more than lip service to ensure that 
residents and businesses have enough power to function.

While deregulation's brakes may have been applied in some locales, it doesn't 
mean that development incentives likewise have been scaled back. 

"There is no question that California was the wake-up call for these states," 
said Craig Goodman, president of the National Energy Marketers Association. 

Midwest a hotbed for incentives
Many of the states that have already passed legislation to entice new plant 
development are located in the Midwest, an area that, while not yet suffering 
from a lack of power, slowly, inexorably is heading in that direction. 

"Iowa, Illinois and Ohio are located in ECAR (the East Central Area of the 
North American Electric Reliability Council, or NERC), which is not yet in a 
crisis situation when it comes to sufficient power, but is only a year or two 
away from that crisis," said Robert Burns, senior research associate with the 
National Regulatory Research Institute at Ohio State University in Columbus, 
Ohio. 

In its latest self-assessment presented as part of NERC's most recent 10-year 
projection, 2000-2009, ECAR said that if 10,400 MW of new capacity is not 
added within ECAR as planned, capacity margins within the region will go 
negative in 2005. 

PPAs a no-no in Iowa
No plant of any significant size has been built in Iowa since 1983, but 
legislators, during a one-day special session in June, put in place what they 
hope will spur additional development. 

The Iowa measure allows utilities to see how their costs will be incorporated 
into rates prior to plant investment, and also permits municipal systems to 
band together to finance new facilities. 

One item the Iowa legislature could not get past a veto that Gov. Tom Vilsack 
promised was allowing utilities to purchase power via power purchase 
contracts from unregulated affiliates. 

The governor said such a measure would lock in profits for utilities and 
preclude potential rate cuts. Proponents say the governor effectively locked 
out millions of dollars of investment in Iowa by Madison, Wis.-based Alliant 
Energy Corp., which reportedly wanted to build as much as 1,200 MW of 
capacity in Iowa. 

Wisconsin Energy likes the tune
Northeast of Iowa, Wisconsin appears to be heading off a problem nearly all 
power plant developers have these days: a bad case of "not in my backyard." 

"Even if a state approves a new power supply, you still have to deal with 
local siting officials and NIMBYism," said Goodman. 

One Wisconsin proposal given serious consideration is to double the impact 
plants have on shared revenue payments, to $250 million from $125 million. 

Changing shared revenue payments to provide additional compensation to local 
governments that favor plant construction on existing plant sites also has 
been introduced in Wisconsin. 

Wisconsin Gov. Scott McCallum also has proposed lowering the state's gross 
receipts tax on wholesale power to 1.59% from the current 3.19%.

Many of the proposals floating around the Badger State are music to the ears 
of Wisconsin Energy, which is looking to spend some $7 billion over the next 
decade to construct five new power plants. 

Not everyone likes the look of incentive legislation in Iowa, Wisconsin and 
other states. Many of the new laws are geared toward assisting incumbent 
utilities*effectively snubbing independent power producers, the IPPs say. 

"I would not call many of these incentive packages incentives for merchant 
power producers," said Samantha Slater, manager of state and regional affairs 
for the Electric Power Supply Association. "Utilities only building new 
plants definitely is not the way to go." 

Big doings in Illinois
Perhaps the biggest, most all-encompassing incentive package passed by a 
state in recent memory isn't specifically about promoting plant development. 

Illinois Gov. George H. Ryan in late June signed legislation that provides up 
to $3.5 billion in incentives designed, industry watchers say, to preserve 
and promote the state's $1 billion coal industry*and keep 25,000 coal-related 
jobs intact.

"Illinois in part wanted to protects its coal jobs with this legislation," 
said Paul Cetevich, director of energy services at the Utility Research 
Center at the University of Florida's Warrington College of Business in 
Gainesville. "Illinois has been trying to do similar things for a number of 
years." 

The Illinois plan includes sales (6.5%) and utility tax exemptions, along 
with an investment tax credit, millions for a financial assistance program 
for coal-fired facilities, bond funds set aside to be used for transmission 
upgrades and to finance renewable energy projects, even a review by the state 
Environmental Protection Agency to determine if new regulations concerning 
older coal-fired plant emissions are warranted.

Highlights of Illinois energy incentive legislation  Designates new baseload 
plants, the mines that fuel them or firms that construct new or upgrade 
existing transmission lines as so-called high-impact businesses. These 
businesses are provided sales tax exemptions on building materials and 
equipment, utility tax exemptions and investment tax credits. (Natural 
gas-fired plants are only eligible for sales tax exemption.)  Creates a $500 
million financial assistance program for coal-fired plants equal to the 
amount of general obligation bond funding that can be repaid by coal tax 
revenues gained on new Illinois coal purchases.  Provides up to $1.7 billion 
in revenue bond authorization to provide financing for electric plants 
generating Illinois coal mining jobs, including mine-mouth plants and plants 
that use clean-coal technology, repayable by the developers.  Provides up to 
$300 million in revenue bond authorization designed to spur upgrades to the 
transmission grid in Illinois, repayable by the wires' owner.  Provides up to 
$500 million in revenue bond authorization to finance renewable energy 
projects, and $500 million for existing coal-fired plants to add scrubbers, 
both repayable by the developers.  Mandates a review by the Illinois 
Environmental Protection Agency of the need for new state regulations 
governing emissions by older coal-fired plants not subject to stricter air 
quality restrictions imposed on new units.  Creation of additional local 
options for property tax abatement.  In addition, Illinois Gov. George H. 
Ryan amended an earlier executive order creating the Governor's Energy 
Cabinet. Under the revised order, the Energy Cabinet will have responsibility 
for siting new generation, overseeing implementation of environmental 
regulations on new plant developers and streamlining the state's permitting 
process for new generation. 

"When the legislative session began in January, you had all the publicity 
about California, the price of natural gas had spiked, there was talk of $3 a 
gallon gasoline, so there were probably three or four versions of coal 
legislation floating around at one time," said Brian Reardon, a spokesman for 
the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs. 

Ryan convened a coal summit in March, took ideas from all invited and put 
together what became the state's $3.5 billion incentive package. 

"I'm very impressed with what Illinois has put in place," the energy 
marketers' Goodman said. "I'm not aware of any other state with as 
comprehensive a package." 

A newly created Governor's Energy Cabinet in Illinois would seem to put 
NIMBYism to bed, if not totally to rest, by assuming responsibility for 
siting new generation, overseeing environmental regulation implementation and 
streamlining state permitting. 

"We were able to develop a comprehensive strategy that addresses our state's 
energy needs while providing for a long overdue boost to our coal industry," 
Gov. Ryan said in a statement. 

Looking at the broader picture
Illinois is preserving the coal industry, but also looking at the broader 
picture, according to the University of Florida's Cetevich. Illinois, and 
many other states, have determined that natural gas-fired plants may not be 
the saviors the country should rely upon. 

"I believe the No. 1 overriding factor, while some states are putting 
incentive packages together, is that the states and public utility 
commissions have realized that with the numerous natural gas price spikes, 
coal is not such a bad option after all." 

"Having all our eggs in the natural gas basket could be a bad thing," agreed 
the National Regulatory Research Institute's Burns. "It cannot have good 
implications." 







Debt Pitch:

In Electricity Crisis:
Selling Power Bonds

The $12.5 Billion Offering,
Crucial to State Finances,
Faces Skeptical Investors

The Risk of Big Budget Cuts 
By Mitchel Benson and Gregory Zuckerman

SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- For the past seven months, Gov. Gray Davis has begged, 
cajoled and even threatened legislators and regulators, to lay the groundwork 
for a $12.5 billion bond issue California needs to cover the cost of keeping 
its lights on. 
Now comes the tough part: persuading investors that the bond is an attractive 
investment. On that score, Mr. Davis's team, whose credibility has been 
battered by California's months-long electricity crisis, is hoping to bounce 
back from a rocky start. 
This week, a delegation headed by state Treasurer Philip Angelides is 
scheduled to visit Wall Street to pitch the municipal debt offering, which 
would be the largest in U.S. history by a factor of nearly four. To succeed, 
Mr. Angelides will have to allay investors' fears of the kind of political 
infighting that already has delayed the issue several times. He will have to 
satisfy bond-rating agencies that the bond is safe enough to merit a top-tier 
investment-grade rating. And he'll have to make investors want to buy it 
without demanding costly inducements that would give California financial 
headaches for decades to come. 
"This isn't building the Panama Canal. It's not Apollo 11," says Mr. 
Angelides. But, he concedes, the bond sale will be "uniquely challenging." 
That is because this giant bond issue won't be backed by the full faith and 
credit of the state or by tax dollars -- the types of guarantees public-debt 
investors often prefer. Instead, the bonds, which will have maturities of as 
long as 15 years, are to be paid off by the state's electricity ratepayers 
from their monthly bills, which some view as a riskier source of cash flow. 
Moreover, there is still a question as to whether the issue's proceeds will 
be adequate to repay the bonds, restore the state's financially troubled 
private utilities to health and finance future electricity purchases. 
Despite these hurdles, many analysts predict California will eventually 
succeed in pulling off the bond deal, though at a cost far higher than 
originally anticipated. In fact, the apparent easing of the state's energy 
crunch may make its marketing job a bit less difficult. A recent drop in the 
price of natural gas, which fuels many California power plants, a mild summer 
in the West and a June decision by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
to impose electricity price caps in the region have helped avert the rolling 
blackouts that roiled the state earlier this year. 
Still, the specter of history overhangs the bond offering. Rating agencies 
are haunted by having failed to warn investors of such public-finance 
disasters as the 1983 default of the Washington Public Power Supply System 
and the 1994 bankruptcy of Orange County, Calif. Moreover, Moody's Investors 
Service and Standard & Poor's assigned investment-grade ratings as recently 
as early January to debt issued by Pacific Gas & Electric Co., just three 
months before the California utility sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy-court 
protection. 
By the time California hopes to sell its bonds, in October or early November, 
the state's electrical-power purchases are expected to leave it owing a total 
of about $10 billion to its lenders and its own general fund. If the bond 
issue is delayed beyond that, or canceled, or if the offering flops, 
California could be forced to make billions of dollars in spending cuts, 
raise taxes or increase electricity rates for the third time in the past year 
to pay back what it owes. 
If the bond sale fails "the state of California will be in deep trouble," 
says Mr. Angelides. "The state general fund must be repaid so money for 
education, health care and children's services can be safe." 
California's need for the bonds -- like most of the state's energy woes -- 
stems from its troubled 1996 electricity-deregulation plan. Under the plan, 
the state's investor-owned utilities were obliged to sell many of their power 
plants to other companies and purchase electricity through a state-sponsored 
power auction. Consumer rates were frozen, but wholesale rates weren't. 
The system worked fairly well until May 2000, when wholesale rates began 
soaring amid tight electricity supplies and stronger-than-expected demand. 
Last year, the state's cost of wholesale power climbed to $27 billion from $7 
billion in 1999. In the first six months of this year, that sum hit $20 
billion. 
With retail rates frozen, Pacific Gas & Electric, a unit of PG&E Corp., and 
Edison International's Southern California Edison racked up billions of 
dollars of debts. In January, after power generators stopped doing business 
with the utilities, the state began buying power on their behalf. It borrowed 
the money from its general fund, normally used to pay for everything from 
public safety and environmental programs to social services and education, at 
a pace of more than $1 billion a month. 
In February, Mr. Davis's allies in the state Legislature helped him pass a 
bill authorizing the state to sell bonds to replenish the fund and to 
continue making power purchases. But legislators cautiously capped the size 
of the borrowing, using a complex formula. Under the new law, the formula 
would allow only for a bond sale of less than $1 billion. 
Realizing that wasn't sufficient, the governor and the assembly drafted 
another bill that scrapped the formula and allowed the state to sell up to 
$13.4 billion of bonds. But, in a setback for Mr. Davis, Republican lawmakers 
banded together to deny him the two-thirds majority needed for the bill to 
immediately become law. As a result, the law won't take effect until 
mid-August, when the public-finance market is all but moribund. 
In the meantime, Mr. Angelides moved to hire underwriters. After receiving 
four dozen bids from Wall Street investment bankers in February, he retained 
a team led by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. But under pressure to get the financing 
moving, the treasurer didn't negotiate firm underwriting fees on the deal. 
At the time, Mr. Angelides said he expected the underwriters to "skinny down" 
their fees given the enormous size of the offering. But Morgan, representing 
a team of underwriters that includes Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., Citgroup 
Inc.'s Salomon Smith Barney unit and Bear, Stearns & Co., says it expects to 
charge standard fees, given the significant challenges presented by the 
issue's size. In the case of a $12.5 billion sale, that amounts to around $56 
million. J.P. Morgan and the California treasurer's office now say the fees 
won't be decided until they determine the bond issue's final size and 
structure. 
From the start, relations between California officials and Wall Street seemed 
fraught with miscommunication. In February, Mr. Davis called a meeting to 
explain to institutional investors, analysts and rating-agency executives his 
blueprint for getting a grip on California's energy crisis. The session, his 
only face-to-face meeting with investors to date, was held at Manhattan's 
Cornell Club. Attendees say the governor kept them waiting for 20 minutes 
before breezing into the room and giving them only a general overview of the 
state's energy plan, which left investors grumbling. 
During the discussion, Mr. Davis, a Bronx, N.Y., native, made light of a 
conversation he had had with Richard Cortright Jr., a Standard & Poor's 
director. "I told him: `You're from Indiana, that explains why you're not 
getting it,'" the governor said, according to several people present. 
"It was intended as a joke, but no one was laughing," says A.J. Sabatelle, a 
Moody's vice president. A spokesman for Mr. Davis says the governor doesn't 
recall the exchange; Mr. Davis is frequently late for public engagements. A 
spokesman for Mr. Cortright wouldn't comment. 
Then, in March, the governor's office set up a conference call to update 
investors. Figuring they wouldn't get a big turnout, they used an open-mike 
system that allowed each investor's comments to be heard by everyone else. 
But with around 100 investors taking part, the presentation by Joseph 
Fichera, a paid consultant who is one of Mr. Davis's top financial advisers, 
turned into a free-for-all, with one caller cursing Mr. Fichera in response 
to one of his answers. 
Infighting among California politicians hasn't helped. Earlier this year, for 
example, state Controller Kathleen Connell criticized the way her fellow 
Democrats, Messrs. Davis and Angelides, were handling the bond sale. Unless 
it was far bigger, she warned, the state would face a "cash-flow crunch" by 
February or March of 2002. The governor's office fired back, calling her 
claims "completely" political. 
California policy makers have "spent most of the year bickering and finger 
pointing," Standard & Poor's director Peter Rigby said in a recent report, 
"and that will raise some uncertainty among lenders." Moreover, investors 
know the state needs the money, and so "it's a buyer's market," Mr. Rigby 
added. 
Aware that it needed a financial pro to make its case to Wall Street, the 
Davis Administration pushed Mr. Fichera to the forefront. Since May, the 
former Prudential Securities investment banker has spent hours on conference 
calls with Wall Street explaining the state's strategy. That and a sense that 
California has gotten a better grip on its electricity woes indicates that 
"the governor's staff is far higher on the learning curve than just a few 
months ago," says Paul Patterson, an electric-power analyst at ABN Amro Inc. 
Critical barriers remain. The state's Public Utilities Commission has yet to 
make key decisions intended to ensure that there's enough ratepayer revenue 
set aside to guarantee that bondholders get paid. On Aug. 23, for example, 
the PUC is expected to take up a rate agreement giving the state's power 
purchaser, the Department of Water Resources, unprecedented authority to 
raise rates without a public hearing. The commission also is expected to 
decide how to divvy up current ratepayer revenue among state and private 
utilities and to take up a measure that would prohibit large industrial 
consumers from, in effect, bypassing the utilities and buying their juice 
directly from generators or traders. 
But opponents of those controversial measures are expected to put up a fight. 
Businesses and consumer groups are particularly upset that the state might 
get carte blanche to raise rates and are threatening to sue to block the PUC 
decision before the state Supreme Court. 
California already has some of the highest electricity rates in the nation. 
Residential consumers in San Francisco, for instance, pay around 14 cents per 
kilowatt hour for power, up from about 10 cents in December. That compares 
with around seven cents per kilowatt hour in Atlanta and 10 cents in Chicago, 
but it is still lower than the nearly 23 cents charged in New York City. 
High costs are a big reason businesses think they ought to be free to buy 
electricity directly. It's not "in the best interest of consumers to 
eliminate direct access in order to market bonds that will keep the price of 
electricity in California higher than necessary for at least 10 years," says 
Allan Zaremberg, president of the California Chamber of Commerce. 
The state's three largest investor-owned utilities, PG&E, SoCalEd and Sempra 
Energy's San Diego Gas & Electric Co., are expected to demand the largest 
possible share of the revenues they collect from ratepayers. PG&E, for 
example, has already asked for a public hearing to examine the state's claim 
that it needs so much money. The pressure to allocate more cash to the 
utilities could also rise if a state-sponsored bailout plan for SoCalEd fails 
and the utility joins PG&E in bankruptcy proceedings. 
Sorting all these issues out before the PUC may lead to legal challenges that 
could delay the bond issuance for months. And potential investors face 
another nagging concern: Under a $43 billion series of long-term power 
contracts signed by the state, electricity generators and traders involved 
get first call on revenue from ratepayers. Only then would bondholders, who 
are accustomed to being first in line, get paid. 
In fact, some investors who were initially enthusiastic about a bond that is 
expected to pay more than half a percentage point above other municipal 
issues in the market are starting to have doubts. Marilyn Cohen, president of 
Envision Capital in Los Angeles, a firm that manages bond portfolios for 
individual investors, says she spent several months setting aside money to 
participate in the deal. Now, she says, she is starting to look elsewhere. "I 
don't have confidence that it will get done," she adds. 
Many investors are concerned the state hasn't proved it can overcome its 
energy crisis. "These are the same guys who told us energy prices were going 
south five years ago, they're trying to gloss over the potential problems," 
says Kelly Mainelli, a portfolio manager at Montgomery Asset Management in 
San Francisco, who is considering investing in the bonds. He says he also 
worries about a spike in natural gas prices ahead of the offering. 
To reassure potential investors, the state now is offering to amass a $3 
billion reserve -- from bond proceeds and ratepayer revenues -- to ensure 
that bondholders would get paid in the event of any unforeseen developments 
in the power market. In addition, California lawmakers are moving a bill 
through the Legislature that would set aside a specific portion of revenues 
from ratepayers solely to pay bondholders. Such an approach could help the 
bond issue "to get a higher rating," says David Hitchcock, director of 
Standard & Poor's state and local government group. 
It might not, however. It isn't clear whether bankruptcy courts can overrule 
state government. So, some investors worry that PG&E's bankruptcy judge could 
rule that money collected by the utility should go to the company's 
creditors, and not to paying investors in the coming bond deal, throwing a 
wrench into the offering. The same would be true in the case of SoCalEd if it 
ended up filing for Chapter 11 protection. 
Underwriters are moving to broaden the appeal of the planned issue by 
chopping it into small slices aimed at different types of investors. There 
will be taxable, tax-free, variable-interest, fixed-interest, short-term and 
long-term bonds. State Finance Director Tim Gage says the state is assuming a 
rating "in the range of single-A" on the power bonds and thus expects to pay 
an average annual interest rate of 5.77% on the tax-exempt issue and 7.77% on 
the taxable bonds. 
Investors and analysts "may think we're crazy," says Guy Phillips, one of the 
state's top legislative aides on energy matters, "But in the end, the 
decision for them is: `Do we see a path to get our money.'"

California ; Op Ed Desk 
Commentary The State Will Pay for Davis' Panic
KATHLEEN CONNELL; PETER NAVARRO

Home Edition

The five-to-20-year power contracts signed in a panic by the Davis 
administration have saddled California with billions of dollars of "stranded 
costs" that will burden our economy and state budget for years to come. 
Now, Gov. Gray Davis' spin doctors want us to believe that these $43-billion 
long-term contracts were both necessary and the impetus for a moderating 
energy market. Here's the real story: 
Last summer, under a flawed deregulation, a handful of large out-of-state 
generators effectively cornered California 's wholesale electricity market. 
This "sellers cartel" first drained our electric utilities dry. In November, 
it became the taxpayers' turn to be victimized, when the Davis administration 
gave carte blanche authority to the Department of Water Resources for energy 
purchases. Between November and July, the department burned through $8 
billion in short-term energy purchases, devouring almost the entire state 
budget surplus. This required the state Public Utilities Commission to pass 
the largest rate hike in California history and will require the state to 
issue $12.4 billion in bonds this fall to service this debt. 
In February, with spot market prices at all-time highs and rolling blackouts 
rippling through the state, the governor's representatives began to negotiate 
long-term contracts with the sellers cartel. This was an ill-advised 
long-term strategy to fight a short-run crisis. To understand why, look at 
the negotiating chessboard from the electricity cartel's perspective. The 
cartel's negotiators knew that within 18 to 24 months, there would be a huge 
glut of power on the market as many power plants were already under 
construction in California and throughout the West. Once the new energy 
resources were available, the cartel would no longer be able to manipulate 
the market. This supply glut would drive prices back to the 1999 range of 
three to five cents per kilowatt-hour, far lower than the prices now set in 
the long-term energy contracts. 
To the cartel members, this looming power glut was a recipe for heavy losses. 
Locking the state into long-term contracts at lucrative rates was their 
redemption. The Davis administration walked into this market inferno, 
bargaining from extreme weakness at the top of the market, signing contracts 
that were too expensive. The administration also capitulated on two highly 
objectionable clauses. The first requires the state to absorb all costs of 
environmental protection for many of the generators. The second holds the 
generators "harmless" for any increase in taxes imposed on the generators by 
the state. This provision essentially freezes taxes on the generators over 
the next several years, requiring taxpayers to pick up the tab. 
Notwithstanding the administration's spin, the current improvement in our 
energy situation may be traced to at least four other factors: This summer 
has been unusually cool, Californians have increased their conservation, 
recessionary forces have reduced demand and, most important, the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission finally imposed price caps on the sellers 
cartel, dampening market manipulation. 
The bottom line is this: Long after the rolling blackouts stop, California 
still will be saddled with billions of dollars of unnecessary electricity 
costs and high bond debt. These higher costs will hurt consumers and 
businesses, put heavy pressure on the state budget for years and inhibit the 
state's economic growth. 
There are two lessons from this multibillion-dollar mistake. The first is to 
have full public review of major energy decisions. Equally important, the 
Public Utilities Commission must be allowed to retain its rate-making 
authority so that problems are not hidden in a state bureaucracy.





Electrical Switch: Now, Cheaper Power
Is Causing Hefty Losses for California 
By Rebecca Smith

Mild weather means that California is escaping blackouts, but it also means 
that the state is amassing power-trading losses that are adding to the cost 
of an energy mess now in its 15th month. 
Internal documents show that so far in July, California has resold the 
equivalent of 8% of the power it bought under short-term and long-term 
contracts that were designed to reduce the state's reliance on the volatile 
and costly spot market. The problem is, the state has had a surfeit of power, 
and it has been selling the juice into the market at a fraction of the price 
it paid, leading to losses from July 1 through Thursday of about $30 million 
to $35 million. 
The losses illustrate the difficulties dogging the state's new energy czar, 
the California Department of Water Resources, despite a softening of 
electricity prices and demand. The department got into the power-purchasing 
business in a big way in January, when the state's biggest investor-owned 
utilities quit buying power because they were no longer creditworthy. Since 
then, the state has signed $43 billion worth of contracts, one for as much as 
20 years, in a bid to tamp down high spot-market prices. Critics now say it 
was a mistake to lock in so much power at such a high cost. 
Power officials say the state has been in the odd position since last month 
of having too much power contracted for off-peak hours. "It's something you'd 
expect when you first get into a new business and you'd hope to reduce it," 
said Pete Garris, chief of operations for the power-purchasing agency. 
Internal numbers from the DWR, which the agency has confirmed, show that on 
average the state paid, from July 1 to Thursday, $123 per megawatt hour for 
some 1.8 million megawatts of power purchased under long-term contracts, and 
$148 per megawatt hour for some 2.2 million megawatt hours of power purchased 
under short-term contracts. In the same period, the records show it sold 
excess power amounting to 320,000 megawatt hours at an average price of $27 
per megawatt hour, less than what it costs to fuel many plants. At times, the 
DWR sold the juice for as little as $2 per megawatt hour. 
This, ironically, has offered an opportunity to power traders that the state 
was seeking to hem in through its contract program. They have been able at 
times to substitute cheap power they buy from the state for the more costly 
power they otherwise would have to generate to meet their contract 
obligations. 
Despite the agency's power-trading losses, total market costs still are down 
substantially from previous months, partly due to price limits set June 19 by 
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Slacker demand also has been a 
factor. In June, Southern California Edison, a unit of Edison International, 
sold 11.8% less electricity to its customers than in June 2000, reflecting 
energy conservation and reduced demand for air conditioning. 
Since January the state has spent $9.5 billion buying power at an average 
cost of $237 per megawatt hour, according to internal DWR documents. That is 
more than double the price of wholesale electricity last year, when prices 
averaged $114. The state's cash-strapped utilities have reimbursed the agency 
$1.53 billion of the $9.5 billion it has spent so far. As a result of the 
huge shortfall, the state has tapped California 's general fund and now is 
pursuing a plan to sell $12.5 billion worth of revenue bonds to replenish its 
coffers. 
The state signed dozens of long-term power contracts after January, pushed by 
federal energy regulators to protect itself against spot-market volatility. 
So far this year, it has spent $851 million under long-term contracts, $2.36 
billion under short-term arrangements and $5.54 billion on spot-market 
purchases, according to the DWR documents. 
But the state's "long" position in July, in which it had too much power, has 
at times given power-trading companies an arbitrage opportunity. Last 
Wednesday, for example, the state sold electricity for as little as $2 per 
megawatt hour on the same day that it was paying $22 to $75 on the spot 
market, presumably because its advance purchases did not exactly match the 
actual shape of demand. 
John Stout, senior vice president for Houston-based Reliant Energy Inc., a 
big energy supplier to California , said a trader can double or triple his 
company's profit by substituting cheap market power from the water-resources 
agency for power the company otherwise would generate. It is also free to 
resell the natural gas it might have used to fuel its plants. "That's what 
the trader is there to do and not leave money on the table," said Mr. Stout.

Greetings:

Sorry to bombard, but there is simply so much in the press today that affects 
just about everything that this group has been, and will continue to be,

Davis spokesman under fire for stock 
By Amy Chance and Dale Kasler
Bee Staff Writers
(Published July 31, 2001) 
Davis administration spokesman Steve Maviglio acknowledged Monday that he 
bought stock in Calpine Corp. in June, at a time when the company was 
announcing a breakthrough in its bid to build a controversial San Jose power 
plant. 
His disclosure came several days after Gov. Gray Davis dismissed five state 
power purchasers for owning stock in the company and drew new complaints that 
Davis administration officials may have improperly mixed their private 
finances and their public roles. 
Maviglio, now acting as interim communications director for the 
administration, said he put in an "open" order for Calpine stock May 31, 
agreeing to buy 300 shares once the stock hit a certain price. 
He said that threshold was met June 20, the day after an action by the 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission brought down "all energy stock prices 
across the board." 
Maviglio said he bought the stock for his individual retirement account, and 
it has since declined in value. Under terms of the open order, he said, he 
had no control over the exact date of purchase. 
Maviglio touted the company in his role as spokesman to the governor in a 
story published June 27 in The Bee. He said Monday that he was simply 
responding to a reporter's question about the company's positive reputation. 
"They have made a clear commitment to invest in California's future," 
Maviglio said at the time. "Their pricing has been far more reasonable than 
any other generator." 
In the interview, Maviglio also contrasted Calpine and Texas-based 
generators. He said Calpine "took a different tack from the Joe Bobs of the 
world," an apparent reference to Joe Bob Perkins, a senior executive with 
Reliant Energy Inc. of Houston. 
Maviglio acknowledged the stock ownership several days after the 
administration ended its relationship with several energy consultants who 
held stock in energy companies, including Calpine. 
Under pressure from Secretary of State Bill Jones, a Republican who hopes to 
challenge Davis for governor next year, the Davis administration has spent 
several weeks scrambling to answer questions about the stock holdings and 
potential conflicts of its consultants and energy traders. 
Jones said Monday that Maviglio should be fired. 
"These actions are unethical, unconscionable, unacceptable, and heads should 
roll," he said in a statement. He said the Democratic governor should direct 
all of his staff to immediately file updated conflict-of-interest statements 
to reflect current holdings. 
Jones, who last week asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to 
investigate administration consultants for insider trading, also said the 
probe should be expanded "to include all of the governor's staff." 
Federal law and SEC regulations forbid anyone from trading stocks while 
possessing "insider information" -- relevant facts not available to the 
public, according to the SEC. Violations can bring lawsuits and criminal 
prosecution. 
Michael Prozan, a Menlo Park lawyer and expert on insider trading, said the 
prohibition against it originally focused on halting company executives from 
profiting from news before it was disclosed publicly. 
But the laws have been broadened to include others besides company employees. 
Investment bankers, lawyers and journalists have been snared by 
insider-trading crackdowns. 
Davis' office was instrumental earlier this year in paving the way for 
removing barriers to construction of a Calpine plant in San Jose. On May 30, 
after opposing the project for years, San Jose Mayor Ron Gonzales announced 
he had negotiated an agreement addressing his concerns and agreed to support 
construction. 
His action came after Davis in April endorsed the plant's construction and as 
the state Energy Commission threatened to approve it over local objections. 
On June 20, the company announced it had won tentative state approval to 
build the plant. 
Maviglio said he buys many stocks and that Enron Corp. and Calpine are the 
only energy generators among them. He owns 100 shares of Enron stock, which 
he purchased in 1996. 
"I deal with hundreds of California companies just about every day, and this 
was one that I saw that looked like a good investment based on public 
knowledge," he said. "I read six newspapers a day or more, and I know what's 
going on in the world. If there's a standard that I can't invest in something 
that I have general public knowledge of, then I wouldn't have any stocks at 
all." 
Maviglio said that the "open" order he placed meant that he could not have 
used inside information to make his stock purchase. 
"Had I had specific knowledge about a contract being signed or what actually 
happened in the office of the mayor of San Jose ... that would have been 
unrelated," Maviglio said. "There was no timing-based sequence to it." 
Calpine stock, despite the company's considerable success, has slipped in 
recent weeks because of general investor anxiety about the California energy 
crisis. 
The stock, which trades on the New York Stock Exchange, closed at $49.30 on 
May 31, the day Maviglio says he placed the purchase order. The order was 
executed as the stock dipped below $40 on June 20, closing that day at 
$39.85. 
The day before, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission announced a 
price-control plan that investors believed was damaging to generators' 
profits. On Monday, the stock closed at $37.13. 
Last week, the Davis administration stopped doing business with five energy 
traders under contract with the administration after Maviglio said 
administration lawyers "came to the determination that there are possible 
violations of the law or close to it." 
"It's not a crime to own energy stock," Maviglio said Monday. "The difference 
with these traders is they're making governmental decisions. They're 
committing the state's resources by spending money to buy power." 
Jim Knox, director of California Common Cause, said he believes the 
Governor's Office made critical errors while hiring staff to purchase energy 
for the state. 
"Had the Governor's Office gone to the trouble to have these people fill 
statements of economic interest, as they were required to do by law, they 
should have known this before they were hired and they shouldn't have been 
hired," Knox said.

Davis energy aide leaves -- without pay 
By Emily Bazar
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published July 31, 2001) 
A high-paid consultant to Gov. Gray Davis who came under fire for his 
dealings with a California utility has cut ties with the administration and 
won't be paid for work already completed. 
Under terms of a settlement made final Monday, former Clinton damage control 
specialist Chris Lehane will no longer help shape Davis' public response to 
the energy crisis. 
Neither Lehane nor partner Mark Fabiani -- who were hired by Davis in May on 
a six-month, $30,000-a-month contract -- will receive any money for their 
services. Fabiani left last month. 
Because Lehane and Fabiani each received at least $10,000 under contract with 
Southern California Edison in the past year, Lewis Uhler, president of the 
National Tax Limitation Committee, filed a lawsuit alleging that conflict of 
interest laws had been violated. 
But Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said Lehane and Fabiani were instrumental 
in persuading the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to limit the wholesale 
cost of power in the state. 
"Chris Lehane provided an invaluable service to the people of California in 
helping us get action after a yearlong wait from FERC," he said. "It's a 
shame that politics gets in the way of public service." 
Uhler, however, said he believes Lehane and Fabiani represent a larger 
problem in the Davis administration, and he pointed to the recent dismissal 
of energy traders who held stock in energy companies. 
"Doesn't anybody in the Governor's Office understand conflict of interest?" 
Uhler asked. 
"This is really sending a signal that the Governor's Office thinks that it is 
somehow above the law."

Power delivery efficiency questioned: Output at low-cost generating plants 
has been cut while costlier ones continue to operate.
By Carrie Peyton
Bee Staff Writer
(Published July 31, 2001) 
California is sometimes deliberately cutting output from low-cost power 
plants while running more expensive ones, utility and grid officials say. 
The sporadic episodes haven't cost much yet, but they illustrate a 
potentially troubling disconnect in the system that has quickly grown between 
two agencies that help deliver electricity to a power-strapped state. 
"We seem to be building this inefficiency into the system, and it doesn't 
seem to be getting better," said Mike Florio, a consumer advocate who sits on 
the governing board of the Independent System Operator. 
The trouble is that the ISO, created in 1996 to manage the power grid in a 
deregulated electric market, tries to run the grid by auctions that -- in 
theory -- provide the cheapest electricity for the state's consumers. 
Meanwhile, the state Department of Water Resources, which in January stepped 
in to buy power on behalf of cash-strapped utilities, isn't bidding at some 
auctions because it believes it can provide cheaper power if it doesn't. 
"We have an inefficient market and an inept government entity. It's sort of 
the worst of both worlds," Florio said, criticizing his agency and the DWR. 
ISO staffers decline to discuss the situation in detail, saying it involves 
confidential bidding behavior. 
But Pete Garris, chief of operations for the power-buying arm of the 
Department of Water Resources, confirmed that the ISO has been asking his 
agency to take part in more auctions, but the state has declined. 
The state's role is to buy electricity for customers of utilities whose 
credit was no longer good enough to buy on their own, he said. 
"We're not in it to do those kinds of marketing functions," he said. "It's 
not necessarily a good fit." 
Some of the ISO auctions are used to lessen congestion on transmission lines. 
Others are used to stabilize the grid by slightly increasing or decreasing 
output when demand doesn't match forecasts. 
Generally, the highest-cost power plants should be the ones cutting back, a 
process the industry calls "decking." 
But since May, on ISO orders, Southern California Edison has repeatedly 
throttled back on the Mohave Generating Station, which produces some of the 
cheapest power available to California today, costing as little as $10 to $20 
a megawatt-hour. 
Edison, which owns a majority share of Mohave, has cut its output by 5,660 
megawatt-hours between May and July, about one-half of 1 percent, at the 
ISO's behest, according to data Edison provided to The Bee. 
The ISO could probably have saved the state's consumers $370,000 at one plant 
if it had asked a higher-cost gas-burning plant to cut back instead of 
Mohave, a coal-burning workhorse in Laughlin, Nev., Florio said. 
The amount sounds like "small potatoes," but in some ways it is more alarming 
than the $14 million the state lost recently by selling excess power for less 
than it paid, he said. 
Industry experts agree that such below-cost sales are common in a business 
where power needs fluctuate dramatically based on the weather. 
By contrast, "this is a dead weight loss. Higher costs are being incurred for 
no good reason," Florio said. 
"The question is, why is the ISO calling on Mohave and not (cheaper) gas 
plants? The answer is, the gas plants aren't bidding ... probably because 
they're contracted with DWR," he said. 
Four Corners, another low-cost coal plant partly owned by Edison, has also 
been throttled back at ISO request, Edison officials said. 
In addition, so few bidders have shown up at ISO auctions to ease stress on 
transmission lines that the system has fallen into disarray, with the ISO 
instead ordering across-the-board power production cuts that are boosting 
costs, Florio said. 
For its part, the ISO will say only that "we are making the most economical 
decisions we can based on the bids available," said spokeswoman Stephanie 
McCorkle. 
DWR's Garris said the state and the ISO have been meeting repeatedly on 
bidding and other coordination issues, and he hopes to have a 
smoother-running system in place by next summer.

Davis: FERC excluding $5 billion of owed refunds 
By Jim Sanders
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published July 31, 2001) 
A ruling by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission last week could cost 
Californians $5 billion in energy refunds, according to Gov. Gray Davis, who 
filed a formal request Monday for a rehearing in the case. 
Although the commission's order suggested that California is owed refunds 
because of exorbitant electricity prices during the recent energy crisis, the 
order's fine print placed severe limits on such refunds, Davis said. 
"FERC is up to its old tricks again," he said. "They talk about refunds for 
California. But in this case, talk really is cheap: The details of its latest 
order show it has no intention of making California whole." 
Tamara Young-Allen, a FERC spokeswoman, declined comment Monday and said the 
agency does not discuss pending cases. 
California is seeking $8.9 billion in alleged overcharges for electricity 
purchased from May 2000 to June 19, when FERC imposed new rules to prevent 
price gouging. 
On Wednesday, FERC ordered hearings to determine precisely how much money 
electricity generators would have to pay in refunds to California. 
At the time, Davis applauded FERC's ruling, saying it validates California's 
claim that "significant refunds are due" and that the agency's action "gets 
us closer to realizing that refund." 
But after poring over details of the 40-page order, state officials said 
Monday that it excludes from consideration more than half the amount sought 
by the state -- leaving $3.9 billion in dispute. 
Attorney Barry Goode and Nancy McFadden, key members of Davis' energy team, 
said the FERC order would not allow refunds: 
For about $2 billion in alleged overcharges stemming from electricity 
purchased by Californians between May and October of last year. 
For electricity bought by the state Department of Water Resources from 
private companies this year. The state says it is owed about $3 billion from 
such purchases. 
The FERC ruling means that only DWR's purchases through the state's 
now-defunct Power Exchange or through the operator of a statewide electricity 
transmission grid will be considered for refunds, officials said. 
Such limitations by the regulatory agency are impractical because the market 
was dysfunctional, leaving DWR with few options, when the state began buying 
electricity for debt-strapped private utilities in January, Goode said. 
"Now FERC says Californians are not entitled to refunds even though they 
determined the prices were excessively high," Davis said. "It's time for FERC 
to decide who they are working for: the greedy out-of-state generators or the 
people of California." 
The motion filed Monday sets the stage for a possible lawsuit. 
"We are calling on FERC to change its order," Davis said. "If it doesn't, we 
will be in court."

Bill would streamline the path to local power: More cities, including Davis, 
are taking a look at creating municipal utility districts. 
By Ed Fletcher
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published July 31, 2001) 
With the future of California's investor-owned utilities clouded by the 
state's energy crisis, more and more cities, including Davis, are looking to 
control their own power destinies. 
Cities, public-power advocates and state Sen. Nell Soto, D-Pomona, are 
pushing a bill through the state Legislature that would make it easier to 
create municipal utility districts. 
"My solution to the power crisis is to reassert our interests and declare our 
independence from out-of-state gougers and in-state irresponsible utility 
companies," said Soto, who is carrying the bill, SB 23xx. 
The Senate approved the bill earlier this month. The Assembly is expected to 
take it up when the Legislature reconvenes in mid-August. The state's three 
investor-owned utilities are fighting the proposal. 
Davis and other cities look longingly at the Sacramento Municipal Utility 
District's success in sheltering ratepayers from the brunt of rate increases. 
Given the cloudy financial future of Davis' power provider, Pacific Gas and 
Electric Co., public power supporters say it's easy to understand why cities 
want local control. If run well, public power can be cheaper and more stable 
than that supplied by investor-owned utility companies, they say. 
"You get to choose the type of energy you want. ... I can't think of a bad 
reason" to have public power, said Robert Milbrodt, a Davis resident active 
in the drive. 
After Yolo County officials last year denied an effort to form a public power 
authority in Davis, the city is ready to take a fresh look. The city, which 
did not formally support last year's attempt, this week is expected to name 
members to a public power task force. It is also hiring a consultant to help 
evaluate the pros and cons of a Davis version of SMUD. 
Soto's bill would create a path to public power that takes county local 
agency formation commissions out of the process. Under the bill, if all the 
cities and counties affected by the proposed municipal utility district sign 
on, the plan bypasses the local LAFCO, goes directly to the California Pubic 
Utilities Commission for analysis and then to the voters of the affected 
areas. 
It was the Yolo County Local Agency Formation Commission that turned down the 
Davis request a year ago, saying critical issues were unresolved. Davis 
public power activists said their plan would have put the basic formation 
question before the voters, leaving the details to be worked out later. 
Public power boosters said lobbying by PG&E doomed their plans. 
SB 23xx also simplifies the approval process, allowing a simple majority of 
voters in the proposed district to create the new power district. 
Seizing transformers, power lines and other utility company infrastructure 
through eminent domain would become much easier for agencies starting 
municipal utility districts under the bill. A utility company would not be 
able to challenge the taking of property based on the merits, but could only 
fight over price. 
The utility companies say the provision would take away a key protection 
against abuse. 
Surveys show Californians like the idea of local officials controlling their 
power, in part because they blame investor-owned utilities for the state's 
electricity mess. 
Nearly two-thirds say local governments taking the place of investor-owned 
utilities would be a good thing, according to a poll released earlier this 
month by the Public Policy Institute of California. 
There are those that warn, however, that pubic power is not without risk. 
"This bill does not address generation," said Dale Hunter, a PG&E lobbyist, 
and municipal utility districts that can't generate their own power will be 
"exposing ratepayers to the volatility of the (power purchasing) market." 
In Los Angeles, the Department of Water and Power has been highly successful 
because it has surplus power to sell, Hunter said. SMUD has only recently 
been forced to raise its rates largely because it generates some of its 
power, Hunter said. 
By creating a way around LAFCOs, shifting the Public Utilities Commission to 
an advisory role and stripping the right of utility companies to fight in 
court, the bill would be removing important public safeguards, Hunter said.

SDG&E denies it deceived ratepayers about debt  


\
objattph 
Company calls gain on sales, debts 'separate transactions' By Craig D. Rose  
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER  July 31, 2001  San Diego Gas & Electric yesterday 
denied allegations that it systematically lied about the debt it racked up 
during the power crisis, despite revelations that the company earned hundreds 
of millions from some power sales.  SDG&E and its parent company, Sempra 
Energy, acknowledged making profits from selling electricity but insisted 
those gains have no bearing on the $750 million debt the utility claims to be 
owed by customers for power purchases during the energy crisis.  "Those are 
completely separate transactions," said Ed Van Herik, a spokesman for SDG&E. 
The company's effort to seal a deal with the state to clear the $750 million 
debt has come under attack by the Utility Consumers' Action Network. The San 
Diego-based consumer group says SDG&E's claimed debt is the result of 
selective bookkeeping, bordering on fraud.  The bottom line, says UCAN, is 
that SDG&E engaged in deception and probably owes its customers money.  
SDG&E, which claimed to have sold customers electricity without markups, 
actually "was buying electricity at a low price and selling it at a higher 
price to us," said Shames. "SDG&E customers have been systematically lied to 
over the past year about this balancing account."  UCAN says that SDG&E 
earned an estimated $450 million from its power sales to the state, while 
publicly declaring that it was posting only losses from buying power.  Shames 
said much of the information leading to UCAN's conclusion came from a 
detailed analysis of documents made available in recent weeks.  The state 
Office of Ratepayer Advocates, meanwhile, yesterday said a new filing by 
SDG&E that claims its power-sales profits belong to stockholders, not 
consumers, is "specious" and "without merit."  Van Herik insisted the company 
had not been misleading. The spokesman noted that the company earlier was 
required to buy electricity from the Power Exchange, a now-defunct 
marketplace established by the state as part of its deregulation plan.  "What 
we said is that we were buying electricity for our customers and passing 
along the cost without markup," said Van Herik.  What SDG&E failed to 
publicly announce was that it was simultaneously selling electricity to the 
Power Exchange for an apparently healthy profit.  Under certain contracts, 
SDG&E had locked in electricity at prices substantially below going rates 
during the ongoing power crisis. The company declined yesterday to reveal 
terms of the contracts. But UCAN estimates the contracts provided electricity 
to the utility at no more than 5 cents per kilowatt-hour.  SDG&E then sold 
that relatively cheap power to the Power Exchange for a higher price and 
pocketed the profit, which it also declined to disclose.  As it profited from 
the power sales, SDG&E bought power at higher prices from the exchange and 
billed customers for what it paid.  Whenever SDG&E's costs to buy electricity 
exceeded what state regulators would allow the utility to charge customers, 
it recorded the amounts in balancing accounts. That account grew to $750 
million.  But SDG&E never offset its losses from electricity purchases with 
its profit from sales.  Van Herik said the practice was appropriate because 
the lucrative contracts for cheap power were owned by the company's 
shareholders, not its customers. The practice of keeping profits and losses 
entirely separate, he said, was endorsed by a California Public Utilities 
Commission audit.  But the first formal ruling on that matter came in June, 
when the full commission ruled that all profits from SDG&E's contractual 
power deals belong to its customers.  SDG&E went to court to overturn the 
commission's ruling, but put the legal effort on hold shortly before Sempra 
reached a tentative agreement with the state to clear the $750 million debt. 
The proposal with the state would reverse the utilities commission ruling and 
award the company's shareholders ownership of the profits SDG&E made from 
selling power.  Van Herik said yesterday that the state made the concession 
because it recognized that SDG&E had a strong legal case.  But Shames says 
the state had a strong case and noted that the Office of Ratepayer Advocates 
agreed. He is asking the utilities commission to reject the deal.  State Sen. 
Steve Peace, D-El Cajon, said he believes that consumer objections to the 
balancing account deal are aimed at getting ratepayers a better deal -- and 
that's something he supports.  "If Michael Shames can improve on the 
balancing account deal I'm in full support as long as we don't lose any of 
the gains we've already gotten," he said.  A spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis 
did not return a telephone call seeking reaction to the UCAN allegations.  
Outside UCAN's office in Little Italy yesterday, a group of trade unionists 
demonstrated in support of SDG&E's position. Dave Moore, a business manager 
for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 465, said SDG&E 
has handled its power purchases in accordance with utilities commission 
rulings.  But Shames said the company sought to shield its actions from the 
scrutiny of consumer groups and the public.  "They consistently said they 
were not making money from this," said the consumer advocate. "For them to 
split hairs and say, 'We didn't make money from purchases, we made it from 
sales,' is disingenuous."  Staff writer Bill Ainsworth contributed to this 
report. 







Sempra set to unveil plans for new plant, business park  


\
objattph 
By Jonathan Heller  UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER  July 31, 2001  ESCONDIDO -- 
City officials are expecting to get their first look today at long-awaited 
plans to build the largest power plant in North County since the Encina plant 
came on line more than 30 years ago.  Sempra Energy Resources will file a 
200-page application with the city Planning Department for a 550-megawatt, 
natural gas-fired power plant and roughly 100-acre business park in southwest 
Escondido, Sempra spokesman Tom Murnane said.  "It (the application) is very 
detailed," Murnane said. "We have not done an application of this sort 
before. This is the first time Sempra Energy Resources has been involved in 
the development of a business park."  Sempra is building the project in 
partnership with JRM Real Estate, a Carlsbad-based developer.  The California 
Energy Commission will have final say on the power plant, which could take 
three to four years to get on line. The City Council will decide on the 
industrial park.  City officials have awaited Sempra's bid ever since the 
idea was broached in January. The project addresses two needs: The power 
plant would provide enough energy to power almost a half-million homes, and 
the business park would bring higher-paying jobs to a city with the lowest 
median income in North County.  "I'm awaiting with great anticipation to see 
what they have planned," said City Councilwoman June Rady. "I have met with 
Sempra officials several times in the past and what they have shared with me 
I've been very excited about."  Sempra has promised that its proposed plant 
would have lower emission levels than any plant now in the state. The company 
also has said the plant would not have a tall smokestack, or a visible vapor 
plume such as the one produced by the city's Iceoplex generating plant.  The 
plant and park are slated for Quail Hills, the last large parcel of vacant 
industrial land in the city. Several previous plans by other developers have 
failed after they discovered the high costs involved with building on the 
hilly terrain.  Neighbors near the area have voiced concerns about noise, 
traffic and dust associated with rock crushing, which would be needed to 
create level foundations for the project.






Davis press secretary confirms buying energy company stock  


\
objattph 
ASSOCIATED PRESS  July 31, 2001  SACRAMENTO ) Gov. Gray Davis' press 
secretary recently purchased the same energy stock as five consultants the 
governor fired last week, he disclosed Monday.  Steve Maviglio confirmed that 
on June 20, he bought 300 shares of stock in Calpine Corp., a San Jose-based 
power generator that has received about $13 billion in state contracts to 
supply electricity for up to 20 years.  Maviglio's disclosure comes after 
Davis' office hastily ended the contracts of five consultants who helped 
negotiate state power contracts and held stock in energy companies.  In a 
related development, an anonymous source told the Los Angeles Times on Monday 
that the Securities and Exchange Commission has launched a preliminary 
inquiry into whether the consultants used inside information to trade the 
energy stocks.  About two dozen Davis energy consultants were required to 
fill out financial disclosure statements after complaints of conflict of 
interest by Republicans and consumer groups.  "When we reviewed them, we 
found possible violations of the law and took swift action," Maviglio said 
Monday before Secretary of State Bill Jones issued a press release calling 
for his termination.  Jones, a Republican, is a candidate for the GOP 
nomination to challenge Davis in November 2002.  Maviglio defended his 
purchase, saying that he "owns several stocks in companies in all fields that 
are growing and are based in California."  Maviglio said Monday that he 
requested on May 31 to purchase the stock if it dipped to $40 a share, which 
it did two days after a June 18 ruling by federal energy regulators 
restricting wholesale electricity prices in California and 10 other states.  
Maviglio served as Davis' chief spokesman urging the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission to impose price ceilings on electricity wholesalers.  
He also said he owns between $10,000 and $100,000 stock in Houston-based 
Enron Corp. He said he purchased the stock in 1997 and has reported it on 
financial disclosure forms. He said that it is "closer to $10,000."  
Meanwhile, two energy consultants to Davis have agreed to forgo more than 
$50,000 in work they did for the state.  Chris Lehane and Mark Fabiani will 
forgo the payments as part of a settlement with a Sacramento-area resident 
who filed a lawsuit objecting to their hiring, calling it a conflict of 
interest.  Fabiani could not be reached for comment Monday. In the 
settlement, they admitted no wrongdoing.  Lehane issued a statement through 
the governor's office, calling it "simply not worth the bother to challenge 
the controller in court."  Davis has come under fire for his May hiring of 
Lehane, former press secretary for Vice President Al Gore, and Fabiani, a 
deputy campaign manager for Gore's presidential run.  They were hired to help 
shape Davis' response to the energy crisis, and helped craft Davis' 
aggressive attack on Texas-based energy companies and President Bush.  Both 
also have advised Southern California Edison, which is negotiating for state 
help in avoiding bankruptcy. Financial disclosure forms showed they have each 
received at least $10,000 from Edison in the past year.  Davis announced at 
the end of June that Fabiani terminated his contract, and Davis scaled back 
Lehane's role with the state.  State Controller Kathleen Connell then said 
she would not pay Lehane and Fabiani for any of their work and now the two 
have agreed they will not fight her decision, Maviglio said.  Lewis K. Uhler, 
the Placer County man who filed the lawsuit, said the settlement 
"accomplished our objectives."  "We wanted to block the egregious use of 
taxpayer funds for essentially political spinmeisters," he said. Uhler is 
president of the Roseville-based National Tax Limitation Committee.  Maviglio 
said that Fabiani and Lehane "did good work for the state" and helped the 
state win victories with federal regulators. 






THE STATE
Davis' Energy Advisors Draw SEC Attention
Probe: Under review is the possible use of inside information to buy power 
company stocks. GOP rival of governor requested the inquiry.

TIMES STAFF WRITERS

July 31 2001

The Securities and Exchange Commission has launched a preliminary inquiry 
into whether energy consultants advising Gov. Gray Davis used inside 
information to trade stocks of power companies doing business with the state, 
a source with knowledge of the matter said Monday.

The federal agency began its review late last week, the source said, in 
response to a request from California Secretary of State Bill Jones. A 
Republican rival of Davis, Jones charged that stock trading by consultants 
may have violated federal laws barring buying and selling based on 
information not available to the public.

On Friday, top aides to the governor disclosed that five consultants had been 
fired for possible conflicts of interest between their official positions and 
their personal finances. As news of the SEC inquiry spread through the 
capital Monday, Davis officials were confronted by a flurry of questions 
about who in the administration owns energy stocks.

Financial disclosure records filed by the governor's spokesman, Steve 
Maviglio, show that he owns between $10,000 and $100,000 in a Texas company 
he and his boss have accused of making "obscene" profits while California has 
been "on its knees." Maviglio said he bought the shares in Houston-based 
Enron Corp. in 1996.

"It's not a crime to own energy stock," Maviglio said.

He also owns 300 shares of San Jose-based Calpine Corp., which has the 
largest share of the $43 billion in long-term state power contracts.

Maviglio placed the order for the stock on May 31, one day after San Jose's 
mayor dropped his opposition to a controversial Calpine plant favored by the 
governor and others. Under the terms of Maviglio's purchase, the transaction 
was completed about three weeks later when the stock reached $40 a share, a 
value of $12,000. It has since fallen in value.

"I viewed it as a good long-term investment," Maviglio said, adding that he 
purchased the shares for his retirement account based on publicly available 
information.

The Davis administration has spared Calpine the kind of fierce criticisms 
that it has leveled at other electricity suppliers, such as Enron. But 
California's grid operator has identified the company as one of many energy 
merchants to overcharge the state millions of dollars.

The fired consultants also owned shares in Calpine, ranging in value from 
several thousand dollars to more than $100,000, records show.

Another top Davis administration official, legal affairs secretary Barry 
Goode, disclosed in his economic interest statement that he recently held 
between $100,000 and $1 million in another out-of-state company accused of 
multimillion-dollar price gouging.

In a statement, Goode said he sold his stock in Williams Co's. a month after 
he began working for the governor in February. Goode said the shares were 
supposed to be sold before he went on the state payroll, but his broker 
failed to do so.

In light of the recent disclosures, Secretary of State Jones said the 
governor must do more to ensure the public that its interest comes first.

"The governor should direct all of his staff to immediately file updated 
conflict of interest statements that reflect current holdings and any 
activity since their last statement of economic interest was filed," said 
Jones, who is seeking the GOP nomination for governor.

Word of the SEC's entry into California's energy problems comes as the 
governor faces harsh criticism from lawmakers and others for the quick and 
broad hiring of highly paid private consultants to guide him through the 
crisis.

In his written request to the SEC, Jones said that recently filed disclosure 
documents showed that at least one consultant bought and sold shares of two 
energy companies within the same month, raising "a red flag" about the 
possibility of insider trading.

State law prohibits officials from participating in decisions involving their 
personal financial interests.

The five consultants fired last week were among 11 named in Jones' letter, 
delivered to the San Francisco office of the SEC last Wednesday. It was not 
clear which individuals are the focus of the SEC's inquiry, or whether the 
agency's review would result in any charges.

Two of the former traders said Monday that they had not been contacted by 
federal investigators and knew nothing of an inquiry into possible insider 
trading.

But William Mead, fired Thursday, said it is no mystery why so many of his 
colleagues owned Calpine stock.

Mead said he bought it 2 1/2 years ago and made so much money he recommended 
it to his colleagues last year, while they all still worked for the 
now-defunct California Power Exchange in Alhambra. Calpine power was not 
traded on that exchange, so there was no conflict of interest, he said.

Mead and three other energy traders--hired by the state in February and 
March--were terminated by the Davis administration for allegedly buying power 
for the state from Calpine while owning the company's stock. Fired traders 
Herman Leung, Peggy Cheng and Constantine Louie did not list the date of 
their Calpine purchases on financial statements that the state required to be 
filed only two weeks ago.

"But I'm sure they bought it while they were still at the power exchange, 
because that's when we discussed it," Mead said. "It was kind of like a 
hobby. I'm sure it wasn't done with the intent to manipulate."

Former trader Elaine Griffin, who also owned Calpine stock and resigned two 
weeks ago to take another job, said she didn't know she owned energy 
securities until she checked with her financial advisor July 13, just before 
leaving her state job.

Griffin said she and her husband own about $10,000 worth of Calpine stock in 
individual retirement accounts managed by their advisor, who bought the stock 
Feb. 1 without their knowledge, she said, after research found it to be a 
good investment.

"I kind of feel like we've been used for political reasons," Griffin said. 
"We would have disclosed anything right at first, but they never asked."

As a trader, Griffin said she occasionally bought Calpine power for the 
state, but only at market prices.

Meanwhile, two Democratic political consultants, who helped Davis polish his 
image after the ongoing energy crisis caused his poll numbers to plummet, 
have agreed to accept no payment for their work as part of an out-of-court 
settlement of a taxpayer lawsuit.

Tom Hiltachk, a lawyer for conservative anti-tax activist Lewis Uhler, said 
the settlement was reached last Friday after negotiations with lawyers for 
communications consultants Mark Fabiani and Chris Lehane.

"Now they will not receive one red cent," said Hiltachk. "Very simply Mr. 
Fabiani and Mr. Lehane have agreed to cease all activities for the governor, 
to accept no payments for their services and to basically get out of the 
consulting business with the governor."

As his part of the agreement, Hiltachk said, Uhler withdrew his lawsuit 
Monday morning.

Uhler had filed a lawsuit against the two consultants and Controller Kathleen 
Connell in June contending that they should not receive any payments because 
of a conflict of interest. The two men also did consulting work for 
financially troubled Southern California Edison, which was seeking help from 
Davis and the Legislature.

Connell, a former Los Angeles mayoral candidate who has been at odds with 
Davis since he endorsed an opponent, had held up the payments pending the 
outcome of the lawsuit.

Under an agreement with Davis, the men were to have been paid $30,000 a month 
for six months.

Fabiani and Lehane could not be reached for comment.

California governor's press secretary confirms buying energy company stock

(07-31) 07:23 PDT SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- 
Gov. Gray Davis' press secretary says he owns stock in the same energy 
company as five state consultants who were fired because of possible conflict 
of interest. 
Steve Maviglio confirmed Monday that on June 20 he bought 300 shares of stock 
in Calpine Corp., a San Jose-based power generator that has received about 
$13 billion in state contracts to supply electricity for up to 20 years. 
Secretary of State Bill Jones called for Maviglio's termination. Jones is a 
candidate for the GOP nomination to challenge Davis in November 2002. 
The five energy consultants were fired last week because they owned shares in 
Calpine and also had helped the state buy electricity from the company. "We 
did not want them making governmental decisions and holding these stocks," 
said Barry Goode, the governor's legal affairs secretary. 
An anonymous source told the Los Angeles Times on Monday that the Securities 
and Exchange Commission has launched a preliminary inquiry into whether the 
consultants used inside information to trade energy stocks. 
Maviglio defended his investment, saying that he "owns several stocks in 
companies in all fields that are growing and are based in California." 
He said he had arranged to buy Calpine stock if it dipped to $40 a share, 
which it did two days after a June 18 ruling by federal energy regulators 
restricting wholesale electricity prices in California and 10 other states. 
Calpine stock closed Monday at $37.13. 
Maviglio had served as Davis' chief spokesman urging the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission to impose price ceilings on electricity wholesalers. 
He also said he owns stock worth $10,000 to $100,000 in Houston-based Enron 
Corp., the nation's largest power wholesaler. He said he bought the stock in 
1997 and has reported it on financial disclosure forms. He said his holding 
is "closer to $10,000."

PG&E's $500,000,000 second-quarter surprise

U213760.DTL>
PG&E Corp. said yesterday that it will earn $500 million to $600 million more 
than anticipated in the second quarter because its bankrupt utility was able 
to buy cheaper electricity in March as wholesale prices dropped. 
As a consequence, PG&E reduced the amount of money it says the utility, 
Pacific Gas and Electric Co., lost during California's energy crisis from 
$5.2 billion to between $4.6 billion and $4.7 billion. 
"Its a good thing for PG&E," said Paul Fremont, an energy industry analyst 
with Jefferies & Co., an investment bank in New York. "But it clearly does 
not get them to the level where they are able to emerge from bankruptcy and 
make all of their creditors whole." 
The disclosure by PG&E Corp. yesterday adds a modest boost to its quarterly 
earnings report, set for tomorrow morning. The company is expected to report 
an operating profit of 71 cents per share, according to analysts polled by 
Thomson Financial/First Call, an investment research firm. 
PG&E Corp. is the owner of Pacific Gas & Electric Co., which filed for 
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April after electricity prices soared 
this year. The utility had previously estimated that it lost $1.1 billion in 
the first quarter and $4.1 billion in the fourth because it was prohibited by 
the state Public Utilities Commission from passing higher costs on to 
consumers. 
PG&E Corp. also includes a energy producing unit, which generally makes 
money, and a venture capital arm. Neither of those divisions is affected by 
the utility's bankruptcy. 
The utility said it got a small break in March as the price it was paying to 
the California Independent System Operator for energy declined sharply. The 
unanticipated drop was attributed to declining demand because of energy 
conservation, low tempera- 
tures and the opening of new power plants in the state. 
The utility also benefited from the cancellation of power contracts by 
companies that did not want to do business with a bankrupt partner. Those 
contracts were for selling power at below cost. 
What is the utility's gain, though, may be a negative for PG&E's power- 
producing division. The lower prices could mean the energy-producing group 
will make less money from its sales, analysts said.

GOV. GRAY DAVIS seems to have an ethical blind spot when it comes to the 
hiring of outsiders to help manage California's energy crisis. 
Throughout the crisis, Davis has been intolerably slow in responding to 
questions about whether certain members of his inner circle -- drawing big 
checks off the public payroll -- might have possible financial conflicts. 
As of yesterday, the governor's office still has not required 16 contractors 
to file public disclosure documents that would reveal whether they have any 
financial stake in companies affected by policies they help develop. 
Steve Maviglio, the governor's press secretary, said 42 energy "consultants" 
have filed their economic disclosure statements. But he said the other 16 
were "contractors" -- without actual decisionmaking authority -- and were 
thus not required to fill out the forms. 
Maviglio's "contractor versus consultant" distinctions are technical and 
semantic. His spin simply doesn't wash. 
The bottom line is that "contractors" who are making big decisions involving 
big dollars for the state are not playing by the same rules as others in the 
public trust. 
For example, Davis has exempted two Wall Street executives, Joseph Fichera 
and Michael Hoffman, who are putting together a rescue plan that involves a 
$12.5 billion bond issue. They are getting $275,000 a month for their advice. 
Yet they have not been required to fill out disclosure forms, which would 
allow the governor -- and any other Californian -- to assess whether a 
potential conflict exists. 
"They told us they don't have any conflicts," said Maviglio, who, 
incidentally, confirmed yesterday that in June he bought $12,000 worth of 
stock in the Calpine Corp., the generating company with the largest chunk of 
state power contracts. On July 2, Davis publicly praised Calpine as "the most 
responsible of the generators." 
Davis should have finally learned his lesson last week after having to fire 
five consultants -- all involved in energy trading -- when their belatedly 
filed disclosure forms showed serious potential conflicts. A sixth consultant 
quit. Four of those traders owned Calpine shares. 
A week earlier, the Davis administration was forced to order a group of 
consultants to hastily unload their power-company holdings or lose their 
contracts. 
The governor's office also has been stung by revelations that political 
consultants Chris Lehane and Mark Fabiani, hired at $30,000 a month to 
develop energy-related "communications strategies," also had a contract with 
Southern California Edison. 
Moreover, some of the disclosure forms that have been filed to date have been 
less than complete, especially regarding the timing of the buying and selling 
of energy stocks. 
How many scandals will it take for Davis to insist on full disclosure -- and 
the highest ethical standards -- of everyone who is working for him on the 
energy crisis?

S.F. to vote on electric power to the people 
Measures would start public utility districts

San Francisco -- After decades of trying to persuade San Francisco to take 
control of its electrical system, advocates of public power now have the 
issue before city voters. 
"The timing couldn't be better," said consumer advocate Medea Benjamin, co- 
director of San Francisco's Global Exchange. 
"It's not just the threat of blackouts or the highest rate hikes in history. 
It's the fact that PG&E is in bankruptcy. It's the depletion of the state 
budget," she said. "This is a hell of an opportunity." 
The opportunity she is talking about centers on two November ballot measures 
that would pave the way for creating a public power system and taking Pacific 
Gas and Electric Co. out of the city's electricity market. 
Under the proposed measures, an elected board of directors would set the 
rates and have control over everything from the terms for buying electricity 
to whether to use more renewable energy sources, such as wind, hydroelectric 
and solar power. 
Public power would base policies "on a more localized basis, where the values 
of an individual community can be put into practice," said Ed Smeloff, a 
longtime public power advocate who was recently hired as an assistant general 
manager at the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission. 
One proposal, an initiative placed on the ballot by residents, calls for 
setting up a municipal utility district in San Francisco and neighboring 
Brisbane. The district would be governed by an elected board of directors. 
The other measure, placed on the ballot last week by the Board of 
Supervisors, would create a municipal water and power agency and would affect 
only San Francisco. 
PG&E has mounted a campaign to defeat the measures, so far pumping more than 
$200,000 into the effort. 
"We think the (ballot proposals) are a bad idea," said Frank Gallagher, 
spokesman for the Coalition for Affordable Public Services, the PG&E-financed 
group fighting the measures. "They're confusing and do nothing to address the 
problem." 
The company has a history of opposing public power proposals, derailing a 
plan in Davis in the 1990s and using a legal challenge to stall the start of 
Sacramento's Municipal Utility District for two decades. 
For years, private utilities have enjoyed a powerful hold on state and local 
politicians. But the energy crisis has caused widespread public anger and 
concern, forcing city and state officials to take another look at public 
power. 
A poll conducted this month by the Public Policy Institute of California, a 
nonpartisan think tank in San Francisco, found that nearly two-thirds of 
Californians support the replacement of private electric companies with 
municipal power authorities formed by local governments. 
San Francisco already owns a power system, Hetch Hetchy, which provides power 
for city departments. PG&E provides power to residents and businesses. 
The San Francisco Charter amendment placed on the ballot by the supervisors 
calls for abolishing the city's existing Public Utilities Commission, which 
is run by commissioners and a director appointed by the mayor. The proposed 
public power board would have seven elected directors, but the agency still 
would retain some ties to City Hall. 
The supervisors' plan is intended to be used as a backup to the municipal 
utility district -- commonly known as a MUD -- which is considered to be more 
vulnerable to the expected legal challenges from PG&E. 
"It's a great marriage, and will ensure that we get public power in San 
Francisco," said Board of Supervisors President Tom Ammiano, chief sponsor of 
the board's measure. 
San Francisco is not alone in looking at public power. San Diego, the first 
city to feel the hard pinch of the energy crisis, wants to establish a 
regional public power system in an attempt to pool resources and bring down 
energy costs. 
The East Bay Municipal Utility District, which provides water and sewer 
service, is considering expanding its reach to power. In the Bay Area, the 
cities of Alameda and Palo Alto already have public power. The two largest 
public power agencies in the state serve Los Angeles and Sacramento. 
In San Francisco, the pro-public power forces are going to tout the promised 
virtues of turning the electric utility over to a public authority that by 
law cannot turn a profit. That, they contend, means lower rates. 
"It's an expectation, but it's also tried and true," said Ross Mirkarimi, 
campaign director of MUD Now, the group sponsoring the ballot initiative. 
On average, consumers pay 18 percent less for power from public utilities, he 
said. 
Gallagher, spokesman for the opposition campaign, said ratepayers shouldn't 
assume that public power means lower energy bills. "There's no way the rates 
are going down," he said. 
He blamed the energy crisis not on deregulation but on a shortage of 
electricity, which jacked up prices and undercut reliability. 
"The measures do nothing about supply," Gallagher said. "All this will do is 
cost people money. You can't just take PG&E's assets. You have to pay for 
them."

Davis' advisers probed by SEC 
Published Tuesday, July 31, 2001, in the San Jose Mercury News 
BY WALTER HAMILTON, JEFFERY L. RABIN AND DARYL KELLEY 

Los Angeles Times 


The Securities and Exchange Commission has launched a preliminary inquiry 
into whether energy consultants advising California Gov. Gray Davis used 
inside information to trade stocks of power companies doing business with the 
state, a source with knowledge of the matter said Monday. 
The federal agency began its review late last week, the source said, in 
response to a request from California Secretary of State Bill Jones, who is 
seeking the GOP nomination for governor. Jones charged that stock trading by 
consultants may have violated federal laws barring buying and selling based 
on information not available to the public. 
On Friday, top aides to the governor disclosed that five consultants had been 
fired for possible conflicts of interest between their official positions and 
their personal finances. 
In addition, financial disclosure records filed by the governor's spokesman, 
Steve Maviglio, show that he owns between $10,000 and $100,000 in a Texas 
company he and his boss have accused of making ``obscene'' profits while 
California has been ``on its knees.'' Maviglio said he bought the shares in 
Houston-based Enron Corp. in 1996. 
``It's not a crime to own energy stock,'' Maviglio said. 
Calpine purchase 
He also owns 300 shares of San Jose-based Calpine Corp., which has the 
largest share of the $43 billion in long-term state power contracts. 
Maviglio placed an order for the stock with an electronic broker May 31, one 
day after San Jose Mayor Ron Gonzales dropped his opposition to a 
controversial Calpine plant under pressure from the governor and others. 
Under the terms of Maviglio's instructions, the stock was automatically 
purchased on his behalf when Calpine fell to $40 a share, according Hilary 
McLean, a spokeswoman for the governor. It has since fallen in value. 
``I viewed it as a good long-term investment,'' Maviglio said, adding that he 
purchased the shares for his retirement account based on publicly available 
information. 
The Davis administration has spared Calpine the kind of fierce criticisms it 
has leveled at other electricity suppliers, such as Enron. But California's 
grid operator has identified the company as one of many energy merchants to 
overcharge the state millions of dollars. 
The fired consultants also owned shares in Calpine, ranging in value from 
several thousand dollars to more than $100,000, records show. 
Another top Davis administration official, legal affairs secretary Barry 
Goode, disclosed in his economic interest statement that he recently held 
between $100,000 and $1 million in another out-of-state company accused of

In a statement, Goode said he sold his stock in Williams Co's. a month after 
he began working for the governor in February. Goode said the shares were 
supposed to be sold before he went on the state payroll but his broker failed 
to do so.

Ethics issue in stock buy? 
A top Davis aide bought shares in a power company dealing with the state. 
July 31, 2001 
By JOHN HOWARD
The Orange County Register 
SACRAMENTO A top aide to Gov. Gray Davis bought stock in a power company that 
received a long-term contract with the state, the latest in a series of 
energy investments that have cast an ethical cloud over the state's 
electricity purchases. 
Steven Maviglio, Davis' press secretary and acting communications director, 
ordered through his broker 300 shares of San Jose-based Calpine Corp. stock 
May 31, to take effect when it dropped to $40 per share. It dropped below 
that June 20 and Maviglio purchased $12,000 worth, he said. 
Two days earlier, federal regulators had placed a cap on what Calpine and 
other energy producers could charge for energy -- a cap Maviglio had touted 
on behalf of Davis. 
Monday's disclosure of Maviglio's transaction comes just days after Davis 
fired five consultants who were purchasing energy for the state from a 
company whose stock they owned. At the time, Maviglio said it "appeared to us 
there was a possible violation of the law, or very close to it." 
He said his own situation was different, "because they (the five) were 
committing state resources and timing their purchases." The disclosure of his 
transaction, he said, was "clearly a political smear by a desperate 
candidate," referring to Secretary of State Bill Jones, a Republican 
gubernatorial hopeful and rival of Davis. 
Jones said Maviglio "should be fired immediately" and that Davis should order 
all of his staff to immediately file updated conflict-of-interest statements 
to reflect current holdings. 
Maviglio said he would sell the Calpine stock - which closed at $37.13 a 
share Monday - if requested by Davis' legal staff. He said he spoke with 
those lawyers Monday and they had not made that request, nor had he been 
asked to resign. 
A Davis aide, Hilary McLean, said, "Absolutely, the governor has confidence 
in Steve."







Aide denies stock deal was improper 
Maviglio says the June 20 purchase, submitted online, was in the hands of 
others. 
July 31, 2001 
By JOHN HOWARD
The Orange County Register 
SACRAMENTO The governor's chief spokesman denies he committed any impropriety 
by buying Calpine Corp. stock June 20, saying the purchase was actually in 
the hands of others. 
Steven Maviglio said he submitted on May 31 a purchase order through his 
online brokerage to buy 300 shares of Calpine, a San Jose-based power 
generator that has a long-term energy contract with the state. 
"It could have happened an hour after later (after the purchase order), a 
month later or five years later," he said. "Or never." 
But Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a political scientist at Clare mont Graduate 
University, questioned the wisdom of Maviglio's stock transaction. 
"What I find puzzling is that he moved to change the dynamic of his stock in 
the middle of this energy problem, in the middle of the governor's attacks 
and the governor's negotiations," she said. "There ought to have been an 
understanding that even if not illegal, there should have been a perception 
that he shouldn't be involved in playing with stocks." 
The disclosure of the transaction couldn't have come at a worse time for the 
administration, or Maviglio: On Friday, five state energy consultants with 
stock-firm stock were summarily fired and a state lawyer was reassigned to 
another job. Another consultant with similar investments quit July 14 to take 
a private job. 
All were involved in the energy-purchasing program that was launched under an 
emergency order Jan. 17, in which the state began buying power on behalf of 
the strapped utilities, which did not credit to purchase power on their own. 
Dozens of people were directly involved in the energy purchases. 
Earlier in the day Monday, in a separate issue, the governor's office 
disclosed that two key consultants who had been hired to help Davis with his 
public relations had decided to forgo $50,000 in contract fees as part of a 
legal settlement with Davis' critics. 
The two consultants, Chris Lehane and Mark Fabiani, both veterans of the 
Clinton-Gore White House and political campaigns, had been hired in May under 
a $30,000-a month state contract. 
Republicans complained that Davis was using state money to finance political 
operatives. Fabiani left the payroll earlier under pressure; Lehane left this 
month.







Power firms amp up lobbying 
Politics: Edison spends $5.5 million to gain support for bailout to prevent 
bankruptcy.

The Orange County Register 
SACRAMENTO Edison International has spent more than $5.5 million this year to 
enlist residents and stockholders to lobby the Legislature to bail out its 
subsidiary Southern California Edison and save it from bankruptcy, reports 
released Monday show. 
The latest financial disclosure statements show that energy companies 
continue to spend millions of dollars to influence the Legislature. Meals, 
campaign contributions and tickets to sporting events continue to flow to 
lawmakers and their staffs. 
Overall, the amount spent on direct lobbying of the Legislature rose slightly 
over last quarter, but gifts and contributions to candidates continued to 
fall. The deadline for statements is today, but many companies and candidates 
filed early. 
Edison's $5.5 million is so far the largest expenditure directed toward an 
orchestrated campaign to influence Capitol politicians. Spokesman Brian 
Bennett said Edison spent the money on television commercials to reach all 
Californians and on a telephone appeal directly to stockholders. 
"This was to educate the public about the dangers of bankruptcy to the 
state's economy and to solicit their support in conveying a message to the 
Legislature that bankruptcy is not an option for the Edison company," Bennett 
said. 
The telephone work involved telling stockholders that the company's value 
would drop if lawmakers did not support a bill to save Edison. Then they 
offered to directly connect the stockholders to lawmakers' offices, asking 
that they tell the lawmakers directly to support the bailout. 
Consumer advocate Doug Heller said Edison's spending - which totaled $5.7 
million for the three-month reporting period and jumped from $318,802 from 
the prior quarter - is out of line. 
"It's amazing that a company teetering on the edge of bankruptcy has millions 
of dollars to throw around to politicians and to create phony grass-roots 
campaigns to influence legislators," said Heller, of the Foundation for 
Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. 
Edison said no contributions were made directly to anyone running for office 
or re-election for this quarter. 
In all, lawmakers sitting on energy committees and who had reported by Monday 
night accepted nearly $61,000 from energy-related companies. 
As of late Monday, Assemblyman Dean Florez, D-Shafter, who sits on the 
Assembly Energy Committee, had received the largest contribution from energy 
companies this quarter, $21,000. 
Seven of the largest power producers that sell electricity to the state spent 
a total of $546,488 on lobbying and other efforts to influence the 
Legislature. 
Topping the list was Calpine Corp., which spent $141,204. Duke Energy came in 
second at $99,735.44 - a $20,000 leap over the prior quarter. Most of Duke's 
money was spent on consultants who worked overtime building a defense for the 
company against accusations of price gouging made by former employees. 
"Overall, our consultants spent more time setting the record straight against 
some blatantly false and misleading statements, regarding our rates and plant 
operations, which the state's own documents proved were false," said Duke 
spokesman Pat Mullen. Some lawmakers and energy experts say the state 
documents do not clear Duke of wrongdoing, and the accusations are still 
being investigated by a Senate committee.






Gouger Gray Davis 
California's petulant governor ignores reality as he overpays for electricity

LANCE T. IZUMI Mr. Izumi is a senior fellow in California Studies at the San 
Francisco- based Pacific Research Institute.
On the surface, things seem to be going pretty good for Gov. Gray Davis with 
regard to California's electricity crisis. The governor has scored some nice 
publicity by switching on some new power plants. The weather has been 
unseasonably cool. His poll numbers are edging back up. Yet beneath this 
optimistic picture lie troubling problems. For example, Davis's argument that 
out-of-state power generators are responsible for the electricity crisis has 
been falling apart. For months, Davis has been claiming that private 
generators have overcharged California by $8.9 billion and demanded that this 
amount be refunded to the state. However, after a two-week mediation between 
state officials and the generators, Curtis Wagner, the federal government's 
chief energy regulatory judge, rebuked Davis's claim saying that such a huge 
overcharge "has not and cannot be substantiated." Further, while the 
generators may be liable to refund a much smaller amount to the state, 
perhaps $1 billion, Wagner said that generators are owed more money by the 
state than they owe the state in refunds: "Can a cash refund be required 
where a much larger amount is due the seller? The chief judge thinks not." 
Davis reacted to the judge's ruling by calling it a "raw deal" and by urging 
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to ignore the lack of evidence and 
the judge's conclusions and to "step up and provide the refunds we've asked 
for." Davis's position, as usual, is motivated purely by politics. Indeed, 
Dan Walters of the Sacramento Bee says that Davis is operating in a 
"melodramatic virtual world" de-linked from reality. 
Davis's blame-the-generators argument took another body blow when newly 
released documents showed that, on average, major out-of-state power 
companies such as Enron, Duke, Dynergy and Mirant charged less than the 
average prices paid by the state during the first three months of the year. 
California government utilities, on the other hand, such as the Los Angeles 
Department of Water and Power and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District 
(SMUD), charged the state much more for electricity than the out-of-state 
generators. For example, while Texas-based Enron, a favorite Davis whipping 
boy, charged an average $181 per megawatt hour, SMUD charged an average $330 
per megawatt hour. 
Davis responded to this revelation in typical political fashion. A Davis 
spokesman said that the governor had expressed his anger at "the generators 
who wear cowboy hats" and that "just because there are other entities that 
are charging us more doesn't change the fact that we are getting ripped off 
by companies from Houston, Tulsa, Atlanta or Charlotte." 
Yet, for all Davis' feigned indignation about consumers being ripped off, it 
turns out that he and his regulators are poised to ensure that business 
consumers are ripped off by state government. Davis has signed $43 billion in 
ill-advised long-term purchase contracts at rates above-market-price. The 
state must, therefore, ensure that enough business customers remain in the 
current state-controlled distribution system to pay for high-priced state 
power purchases. This is especially important to Davis since the high prices 
are borne disproportionately by business. Thus, Davis' regulators are set to 
eliminate "direct access," which allows businesses to shop for cheaper power. 
Who's the real gouger? No matter how much Davis points the finger, 
Californians are paying dearly for his political opportunism and bad 
policies. 







Turning Coal into a tradable commodity
By Rick Stouffer

With the California power debacle offering a neck-snapping jolt, a number of 
states have determined they must offer more than lip service to ensure that 
residents and businesses have enough power to function.

While deregulation's brakes may have been applied in some locales, it doesn't 
mean that development incentives likewise have been scaled back. 

"There is no question that California was the wake-up call for these states," 
said Craig Goodman, president of the National Energy Marketers Association. 

Midwest a hotbed for incentives
Many of the states that have already passed legislation to entice new plant 
development are located in the Midwest, an area that, while not yet suffering 
from a lack of power, slowly, inexorably is heading in that direction. 

"Iowa, Illinois and Ohio are located in ECAR (the East Central Area of the 
North American Electric Reliability Council, or NERC), which is not yet in a 
crisis situation when it comes to sufficient power, but is only a year or two 
away from that crisis," said Robert Burns, senior research associate with the 
National Regulatory Research Institute at Ohio State University in Columbus, 
Ohio. 

In its latest self-assessment presented as part of NERC's most recent 10-year 
projection, 2000-2009, ECAR said that if 10,400 MW of new capacity is not 
added within ECAR as planned, capacity margins within the region will go 
negative in 2005. 

PPAs a no-no in Iowa
No plant of any significant size has been built in Iowa since 1983, but 
legislators, during a one-day special session in June, put in place what they 
hope will spur additional development. 

The Iowa measure allows utilities to see how their costs will be incorporated 
into rates prior to plant investment, and also permits municipal systems to 
band together to finance new facilities. 

One item the Iowa legislature could not get past a veto that Gov. Tom Vilsack 
promised was allowing utilities to purchase power via power purchase 
contracts from unregulated affiliates. 

The governor said such a measure would lock in profits for utilities and 
preclude potential rate cuts. Proponents say the governor effectively locked 
out millions of dollars of investment in Iowa by Madison, Wis.-based Alliant 
Energy Corp., which reportedly wanted to build as much as 1,200 MW of 
capacity in Iowa. 

Wisconsin Energy likes the tune
Northeast of Iowa, Wisconsin appears to be heading off a problem nearly all 
power plant developers have these days: a bad case of "not in my backyard." 

"Even if a state approves a new power supply, you still have to deal with 
local siting officials and NIMBYism," said Goodman. 

One Wisconsin proposal given serious consideration is to double the impact 
plants have on shared revenue payments, to $250 million from $125 million. 

Changing shared revenue payments to provide additional compensation to local 
governments that favor plant construction on existing plant sites also has 
been introduced in Wisconsin. 

Wisconsin Gov. Scott McCallum also has proposed lowering the state's gross 
receipts tax on wholesale power to 1.59% from the current 3.19%.

Many of the proposals floating around the Badger State are music to the ears 
of Wisconsin Energy, which is looking to spend some $7 billion over the next 
decade to construct five new power plants. 

Not everyone likes the look of incentive legislation in Iowa, Wisconsin and 
other states. Many of the new laws are geared toward assisting incumbent 
utilities*effectively snubbing independent power producers, the IPPs say. 

"I would not call many of these incentive packages incentives for merchant 
power producers," said Samantha Slater, manager of state and regional affairs 
for the Electric Power Supply Association. "Utilities only building new 
plants definitely is not the way to go." 

Big doings in Illinois
Perhaps the biggest, most all-encompassing incentive package passed by a 
state in recent memory isn't specifically about promoting plant development. 

Illinois Gov. George H. Ryan in late June signed legislation that provides up 
to $3.5 billion in incentives designed, industry watchers say, to preserve 
and promote the state's $1 billion coal industry*and keep 25,000 coal-related 
jobs intact.

"Illinois in part wanted to protects its coal jobs with this legislation," 
said Paul Cetevich, director of energy services at the Utility Research 
Center at the University of Florida's Warrington College of Business in 
Gainesville. "Illinois has been trying to do similar things for a number of 
years." 

The Illinois plan includes sales (6.5%) and utility tax exemptions, along 
with an investment tax credit, millions for a financial assistance program 
for coal-fired facilities, bond funds set aside to be used for transmission 
upgrades and to finance renewable energy projects, even a review by the state 
Environmental Protection Agency to determine if new regulations concerning 
older coal-fired plant emissions are warranted.

Highlights of Illinois energy incentive legislation  Designates new baseload 
plants, the mines that fuel them or firms that construct new or upgrade 
existing transmission lines as so-called high-impact businesses. These 
businesses are provided sales tax exemptions on building materials and 
equipment, utility tax exemptions and investment tax credits. (Natural 
gas-fired plants are only eligible for sales tax exemption.)  Creates a $500 
million financial assistance program for coal-fired plants equal to the 
amount of general obligation bond funding that can be repaid by coal tax 
revenues gained on new Illinois coal purchases.  Provides up to $1.7 billion 
in revenue bond authorization to provide financing for electric plants 
generating Illinois coal mining jobs, including mine-mouth plants and plants 
that use clean-coal technology, repayable by the developers.  Provides up to 
$300 million in revenue bond authorization designed to spur upgrades to the 
transmission grid in Illinois, repayable by the wires' owner.  Provides up to 
$500 million in revenue bond authorization to finance renewable energy 
projects, and $500 million for existing coal-fired plants to add scrubbers, 
both repayable by the developers.  Mandates a review by the Illinois 
Environmental Protection Agency of the need for new state regulations 
governing emissions by older coal-fired plants not subject to stricter air 
quality restrictions imposed on new units.  Creation of additional local 
options for property tax abatement.  In addition, Illinois Gov. George H. 
Ryan amended an earlier executive order creating the Governor's Energy 
Cabinet. Under the revised order, the Energy Cabinet will have responsibility 
for siting new generation, overseeing implementation of environmental 
regulations on new plant developers and streamlining the state's permitting 
process for new generation. 

"When the legislative session began in January, you had all the publicity 
about California, the price of natural gas had spiked, there was talk of $3 a 
gallon gasoline, so there were probably three or four versions of coal 
legislation floating around at one time," said Brian Reardon, a spokesman for 
the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs. 

Ryan convened a coal summit in March, took ideas from all invited and put 
together what became the state's $3.5 billion incentive package. 

"I'm very impressed with what Illinois has put in place," the energy 
marketers' Goodman said. "I'm not aware of any other state with as 
comprehensive a package." 

A newly created Governor's Energy Cabinet in Illinois would seem to put 
NIMBYism to bed, if not totally to rest, by assuming responsibility for 
siting new generation, overseeing environmental regulation implementation and 
streamlining state permitting. 

"We were able to develop a comprehensive strategy that addresses our state's 
energy needs while providing for a long overdue boost to our coal industry," 
Gov. Ryan said in a statement. 

Looking at the broader picture
Illinois is preserving the coal industry, but also looking at the broader 
picture, according to the University of Florida's Cetevich. Illinois, and 
many other states, have determined that natural gas-fired plants may not be 
the saviors the country should rely upon. 

"I believe the No. 1 overriding factor, while some states are putting 
incentive packages together, is that the states and public utility 
commissions have realized that with the numerous natural gas price spikes, 
coal is not such a bad option after all." 

"Having all our eggs in the natural gas basket could be a bad thing," agreed 
the National Regulatory Research Institute's Burns. "It cannot have good 
implications." 







Debt Pitch:
California's Next Test
In Electricity Crisis:
Selling Power Bonds

The $12.5 Billion Offering,
Crucial to State Finances,
Faces Skeptical Investors

The Risk of Big Budget Cuts 
By Mitchel Benson and Gregory Zuckerman

The Wall Street Journal

SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- For the past seven months, Gov. Gray Davis has begged, 
cajoled and even threatened legislators and regulators, to lay the groundwork 
for a $12.5 billion bond issue California needs to cover the cost of keeping 
its lights on. 
Now comes the tough part: persuading investors that the bond is an attractive 
investment. On that score, Mr. Davis's team, whose credibility has been 
battered by California's months-long electricity crisis, is hoping to bounce 
back from a rocky start. 
This week, a delegation headed by state Treasurer Philip Angelides is 
scheduled to visit Wall Street to pitch the municipal debt offering, which 
would be the largest in U.S. history by a factor of nearly four. To succeed, 
Mr. Angelides will have to allay investors' fears of the kind of political 
infighting that already has delayed the issue several times. He will have to 
satisfy bond-rating agencies that the bond is safe enough to merit a top-tier 
investment-grade rating. And he'll have to make investors want to buy it 
without demanding costly inducements that would give California financial 
headaches for decades to come. 
"This isn't building the Panama Canal. It's not Apollo 11," says Mr. 
Angelides. But, he concedes, the bond sale will be "uniquely challenging." 
That is because this giant bond issue won't be backed by the full faith and 
credit of the state or by tax dollars -- the types of guarantees public-debt 
investors often prefer. Instead, the bonds, which will have maturities of as 
long as 15 years, are to be paid off by the state's electricity ratepayers 
from their monthly bills, which some view as a riskier source of cash flow. 
Moreover, there is still a question as to whether the issue's proceeds will 
be adequate to repay the bonds, restore the state's financially troubled 
private utilities to health and finance future electricity purchases. 
Despite these hurdles, many analysts predict California will eventually 
succeed in pulling off the bond deal, though at a cost far higher than 
originally anticipated. In fact, the apparent easing of the state's energy 
crunch may make its marketing job a bit less difficult. A recent drop in the 
price of natural gas, which fuels many California power plants, a mild summer 
in the West and a June decision by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
to impose electricity price caps in the region have helped avert the rolling 
blackouts that roiled the state earlier this year. 
Still, the specter of history overhangs the bond offering. Rating agencies 
are haunted by having failed to warn investors of such public-finance 
disasters as the 1983 default of the Washington Public Power Supply System 
and the 1994 bankruptcy of Orange County, Calif. Moreover, Moody's Investors 
Service and Standard & Poor's assigned investment-grade ratings as recently 
as early January to debt issued by Pacific Gas & Electric Co., just three 
months before the California utility sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy-court 
protection. 
By the time California hopes to sell its bonds, in October or early November, 
the state's electrical-power purchases are expected to leave it owing a total 
of about $10 billion to its lenders and its own general fund. If the bond 
issue is delayed beyond that, or canceled, or if the offering flops, 
California could be forced to make billions of dollars in spending cuts, 
raise taxes or increase electricity rates for the third time in the past year 
to pay back what it owes. 
If the bond sale fails "the state of California will be in deep trouble," 
says Mr. Angelides. "The state general fund must be repaid so money for 
education, health care and children's services can be safe." 
California's need for the bonds -- like most of the state's energy woes -- 
stems from its troubled 1996 electricity-deregulation plan. Under the plan, 
the state's investor-owned utilities were obliged to sell many of their power 
plants to other companies and purchase electricity through a state-sponsored 
power auction. Consumer rates were frozen, but wholesale rates weren't. 
The system worked fairly well until May 2000, when wholesale rates began 
soaring amid tight electricity supplies and stronger-than-expected demand. 
Last year, the state's cost of wholesale power climbed to $27 billion from $7 
billion in 1999. In the first six months of this year, that sum hit $20 
billion. 
With retail rates frozen, Pacific Gas & Electric, a unit of PG&E Corp., and 
Edison International's Southern California Edison racked up billions of 
dollars of debts. In January, after power generators stopped doing business 
with the utilities, the state began buying power on their behalf. It borrowed 
the money from its general fund, normally used to pay for everything from 
public safety and environmental programs to social services and education, at 
a pace of more than $1 billion a month. 
In February, Mr. Davis's allies in the state Legislature helped him pass a 
bill authorizing the state to sell bonds to replenish the fund and to 
continue making power purchases. But legislators cautiously capped the size 
of the borrowing, using a complex formula. Under the new law, the formula 
would allow only for a bond sale of less than $1 billion. 
Realizing that wasn't sufficient, the governor and the assembly drafted 
another bill that scrapped the formula and allowed the state to sell up to 
$13.4 billion of bonds. But, in a setback for Mr. Davis, Republican lawmakers 
banded together to deny him the two-thirds majority needed for the bill to 
immediately become law. As a result, the law won't take effect until 
mid-August, when the public-finance market is all but moribund. 
In the meantime, Mr. Angelides moved to hire underwriters. After receiving 
four dozen bids from Wall Street investment bankers in February, he retained 
a team led by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. But under pressure to get the financing 
moving, the treasurer didn't negotiate firm underwriting fees on the deal. 
At the time, Mr. Angelides said he expected the underwriters to "skinny down" 
their fees given the enormous size of the offering. But Morgan, representing 
a team of underwriters that includes Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., Citgroup 
Inc.'s Salomon Smith Barney unit and Bear, Stearns & Co., says it expects to 
charge standard fees, given the significant challenges presented by the 
issue's size. In the case of a $12.5 billion sale, that amounts to around $56 
million. J.P. Morgan and the California treasurer's office now say the fees 
won't be decided until they determine the bond issue's final size and 
structure. 
From the start, relations between California officials and Wall Street seemed 
fraught with miscommunication. In February, Mr. Davis called a meeting to 
explain to institutional investors, analysts and rating-agency executives his 
blueprint for getting a grip on California's energy crisis. The session, his 
only face-to-face meeting with investors to date, was held at Manhattan's 
Cornell Club. Attendees say the governor kept them waiting for 20 minutes 
before breezing into the room and giving them only a general overview of the 
state's energy plan, which left investors grumbling. 
During the discussion, Mr. Davis, a Bronx, N.Y., native, made light of a 
conversation he had had with Richard Cortright Jr., a Standard & Poor's 
director. "I told him: `You're from Indiana, that explains why you're not 
getting it,'" the governor said, according to several people present. 
"It was intended as a joke, but no one was laughing," says A.J. Sabatelle, a 
Moody's vice president. A spokesman for Mr. Davis says the governor doesn't 
recall the exchange; Mr. Davis is frequently late for public engagements. A 
spokesman for Mr. Cortright wouldn't comment. 
Then, in March, the governor's office set up a conference call to update 
investors. Figuring they wouldn't get a big turnout, they used an open-mike 
system that allowed each investor's comments to be heard by everyone else. 
But with around 100 investors taking part, the presentation by Joseph 
Fichera, a paid consultant who is one of Mr. Davis's top financial advisers, 
turned into a free-for-all, with one caller cursing Mr. Fichera in response 
to one of his answers. 
Infighting among California politicians hasn't helped. Earlier this year, for 
example, state Controller Kathleen Connell criticized the way her fellow 
Democrats, Messrs. Davis and Angelides, were handling the bond sale. Unless 
it was far bigger, she warned, the state would face a "cash-flow crunch" by 
February or March of 2002. The governor's office fired back, calling her 
claims "completely" political. 
California policy makers have "spent most of the year bickering and finger 
pointing," Standard & Poor's director Peter Rigby said in a recent report, 
"and that will raise some uncertainty among lenders." Moreover, investors 
know the state needs the money, and so "it's a buyer's market," Mr. Rigby 
added. 
Aware that it needed a financial pro to make its case to Wall Street, the 
Davis Administration pushed Mr. Fichera to the forefront. Since May, the 
former Prudential Securities investment banker has spent hours on conference 
calls with Wall Street explaining the state's strategy. That and a sense that 
California has gotten a better grip on its electricity woes indicates that 
"the governor's staff is far higher on the learning curve than just a few 
months ago," says Paul Patterson, an electric-power analyst at ABN Amro Inc. 
Critical barriers remain. The state's Public Utilities Commission has yet to 
make key decisions intended to ensure that there's enough ratepayer revenue 
set aside to guarantee that bondholders get paid. On Aug. 23, for example, 
the PUC is expected to take up a rate agreement giving the state's power 
purchaser, the Department of Water Resources, unprecedented authority to 
raise rates without a public hearing. The commission also is expected to 
decide how to divvy up current ratepayer revenue among state and private 
utilities and to take up a measure that would prohibit large industrial 
consumers from, in effect, bypassing the utilities and buying their juice 
directly from generators or traders. 
But opponents of those controversial measures are expected to put up a fight. 
Businesses and consumer groups are particularly upset that the state might 
get carte blanche to raise rates and are threatening to sue to block the PUC 
decision before the state Supreme Court. 
California already has some of the highest electricity rates in the nation. 
Residential consumers in San Francisco, for instance, pay around 14 cents per 
kilowatt hour for power, up from about 10 cents in December. That compares 
with around seven cents per kilowatt hour in Atlanta and 10 cents in Chicago, 
but it is still lower than the nearly 23 cents charged in New York City. 
High costs are a big reason businesses think they ought to be free to buy 
electricity directly. It's not "in the best interest of consumers to 
eliminate direct access in order to market bonds that will keep the price of 
electricity in California higher than necessary for at least 10 years," says 
Allan Zaremberg, president of the California Chamber of Commerce. 
The state's three largest investor-owned utilities, PG&E, SoCalEd and Sempra 
Energy's San Diego Gas & Electric Co., are expected to demand the largest 
possible share of the revenues they collect from ratepayers. PG&E, for 
example, has already asked for a public hearing to examine the state's claim 
that it needs so much money. The pressure to allocate more cash to the 
utilities could also rise if a state-sponsored bailout plan for SoCalEd fails 
and the utility joins PG&E in bankruptcy proceedings. 
Sorting all these issues out before the PUC may lead to legal challenges that 
could delay the bond issuance for months. And potential investors face 
another nagging concern: Under a $43 billion series of long-term power 
contracts signed by the state, electricity generators and traders involved 
get first call on revenue from ratepayers. Only then would bondholders, who 
are accustomed to being first in line, get paid. 
In fact, some investors who were initially enthusiastic about a bond that is 
expected to pay more than half a percentage point above other municipal 
issues in the market are starting to have doubts. Marilyn Cohen, president of 
Envision Capital in Los Angeles, a firm that manages bond portfolios for 
individual investors, says she spent several months setting aside money to 
participate in the deal. Now, she says, she is starting to look elsewhere. "I 
don't have confidence that it will get done," she adds. 
Many investors are concerned the state hasn't proved it can overcome its 
energy crisis. "These are the same guys who told us energy prices were going 
south five years ago, they're trying to gloss over the potential problems," 
says Kelly Mainelli, a portfolio manager at Montgomery Asset Management in 
San Francisco, who is considering investing in the bonds. He says he also 
worries about a spike in natural gas prices ahead of the offering. 
To reassure potential investors, the state now is offering to amass a $3 
billion reserve -- from bond proceeds and ratepayer revenues -- to ensure 
that bondholders would get paid in the event of any unforeseen developments 
in the power market. In addition, California lawmakers are moving a bill 
through the Legislature that would set aside a specific portion of revenues 
from ratepayers solely to pay bondholders. Such an approach could help the 
bond issue "to get a higher rating," says David Hitchcock, director of 
Standard & Poor's state and local government group. 
It might not, however. It isn't clear whether bankruptcy courts can overrule 
state government. So, some investors worry that PG&E's bankruptcy judge could 
rule that money collected by the utility should go to the company's 
creditors, and not to paying investors in the coming bond deal, throwing a 
wrench into the offering. The same would be true in the case of SoCalEd if it 
ended up filing for Chapter 11 protection. 
Underwriters are moving to broaden the appeal of the planned issue by 
chopping it into small slices aimed at different types of investors. There 
will be taxable, tax-free, variable-interest, fixed-interest, short-term and 
long-term bonds. State Finance Director Tim Gage says the state is assuming a 
rating "in the range of single-A" on the power bonds and thus expects to pay 
an average annual interest rate of 5.77% on the tax-exempt issue and 7.77% on 
the taxable bonds. 
Investors and analysts "may think we're crazy," says Guy Phillips, one of the 
state's top legislative aides on energy matters, "But in the end, the 
decision for them is: `Do we see a path to get our money.'"

California ; Op Ed Desk 
Commentary The State Will Pay for Davis' Panic

The five-to-20-year power contracts signed in a panic by the Davis 
administration have saddled California with billions of dollars of "stranded 
costs" that will burden our economy and state budget for years to come. 
Now, Gov. Gray Davis' spin doctors want us to believe that these $43-billion 
long-term contracts were both necessary and the impetus for a moderating 
energy market. Here's the real story: 
Last summer, under a flawed deregulation, a handful of large out-of-state 
generators effectively cornered California 's wholesale electricity market. 
This "sellers cartel" first drained our electric utilities dry. In November, 
it became the taxpayers' turn to be victimized, when the Davis administration 
gave carte blanche authority to the Department of Water Resources for energy 
purchases. Between November and July, the department burned through $8 
billion in short-term energy purchases, devouring almost the entire state 
budget surplus. This required the state Public Utilities Commission to pass 
the largest rate hike in California history and will require the state to 
issue $12.4 billion in bonds this fall to service this debt. 
In February, with spot market prices at all-time highs and rolling blackouts 
rippling through the state, the governor's representatives began to negotiate 
long-term contracts with the sellers cartel. This was an ill-advised 
long-term strategy to fight a short-run crisis. To understand why, look at 
the negotiating chessboard from the electricity cartel's perspective. The 
cartel's negotiators knew that within 18 to 24 months, there would be a huge 
glut of power on the market as many power plants were already under 
construction in California and throughout the West. Once the new energy 
resources were available, the cartel would no longer be able to manipulate 
the market. This supply glut would drive prices back to the 1999 range of 
three to five cents per kilowatt-hour, far lower than the prices now set in 
the long-term energy contracts. 
To the cartel members, this looming power glut was a recipe for heavy losses. 
Locking the state into long-term contracts at lucrative rates was their 
redemption. The Davis administration walked into this market inferno, 
bargaining from extreme weakness at the top of the market, signing contracts 
that were too expensive. The administration also capitulated on two highly 
objectionable clauses. The first requires the state to absorb all costs of 
environmental protection for many of the generators. The second holds the 
generators "harmless" for any increase in taxes imposed on the generators by 
the state. This provision essentially freezes taxes on the generators over 
the next several years, requiring taxpayers to pick up the tab. 
Notwithstanding the administration's spin, the current improvement in our 
energy situation may be traced to at least four other factors: This summer 
has been unusually cool, Californians have increased their conservation, 
recessionary forces have reduced demand and, most important, the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission finally imposed price caps on the sellers 
cartel, dampening market manipulation. 
The bottom line is this: Long after the rolling blackouts stop, California 
still will be saddled with billions of dollars of unnecessary electricity 
costs and high bond debt. These higher costs will hurt consumers and 
businesses, put heavy pressure on the state budget for years and inhibit the 
state's economic growth. 
There are two lessons from this multibillion-dollar mistake. The first is to 
have full public review of major energy decisions. Equally important, the 
Public Utilities Commission must be allowed to retain its rate-making 
authority so that problems are not hidden in a state bureaucracy.





Electrical Switch: Now, Cheaper Power
Is Causing Hefty Losses for California 
By Rebecca Smith

Mild weather means that California is escaping blackouts, but it also means 
that the state is amassing power-trading losses that are adding to the cost 
of an energy mess now in its 15th month. 
Internal documents show that so far in July, California has resold the 
equivalent of 8% of the power it bought under short-term and long-term 
contracts that were designed to reduce the state's reliance on the volatile 
and costly spot market. The problem is, the state has had a surfeit of power, 
and it has been selling the juice into the market at a fraction of the price 
it paid, leading to losses from July 1 through Thursday of about $30 million 
to $35 million. 
The losses illustrate the difficulties dogging the state's new energy czar, 
the California Department of Water Resources, despite a softening of 
electricity prices and demand. The department got into the power-purchasing 
business in a big way in January, when the state's biggest investor-owned 
utilities quit buying power because they were no longer creditworthy. Since 
then, the state has signed $43 billion worth of contracts, one for as much as 
20 years, in a bid to tamp down high spot-market prices. Critics now say it 
was a mistake to lock in so much power at such a high cost. 
Power officials say the state has been in the odd position since last month 
of having too much power contracted for off-peak hours. "It's something you'd 
expect when you first get into a new business and you'd hope to reduce it," 
said Pete Garris, chief of operations for the power-purchasing agency. 
Internal numbers from the DWR, which the agency has confirmed, show that on 
average the state paid, from July 1 to Thursday, $123 per megawatt hour for 
some 1.8 million megawatts of power purchased under long-term contracts, and 
$148 per megawatt hour for some 2.2 million megawatt hours of power purchased 
under short-term contracts. In the same period, the records show it sold 
excess power amounting to 320,000 megawatt hours at an average price of $27 
per megawatt hour, less than what it costs to fuel many plants. At times, the 
DWR sold the juice for as little as $2 per megawatt hour. 
This, ironically, has offered an opportunity to power traders that the state 
was seeking to hem in through its contract program. They have been able at 
times to substitute cheap power they buy from the state for the more costly 
power they otherwise would have to generate to meet their contract 
obligations. 
Despite the agency's power-trading losses, total market costs still are down 
substantially from previous months, partly due to price limits set June 19 by 
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Slacker demand also has been a 
factor. In June, Southern California Edison, a unit of Edison International, 
sold 11.8% less electricity to its customers than in June 2000, reflecting 
energy conservation and reduced demand for air conditioning. 
Since January the state has spent $9.5 billion buying power at an average 
cost of $237 per megawatt hour, according to internal DWR documents. That is 
more than double the price of wholesale electricity last year, when prices 
averaged $114. The state's cash-strapped utilities have reimbursed the agency 
$1.53 billion of the $9.5 billion it has spent so far. As a result of the 
huge shortfall, the state has tapped California 's general fund and now is 
pursuing a plan to sell $12.5 billion worth of revenue bonds to replenish its 
coffers. 
The state signed dozens of long-term power contracts after January, pushed by 
federal energy regulators to protect itself against spot-market volatility. 
So far this year, it has spent $851 million under long-term contracts, $2.36 
billion under short-term arrangements and $5.54 billion on spot-market 
purchases, according to the DWR documents. 
But the state's "long" position in July, in which it had too much power, has 
at times given power-trading companies an arbitrage opportunity. Last 
Wednesday, for example, the state sold electricity for as little as $2 per 
megawatt hour on the same day that it was paying $22 to $75 on the spot 
market, presumably because its advance purchases did not exactly match the 
actual shape of demand. 
John Stout, senior vice president for Houston-based Reliant Energy Inc., a 
big energy supplier to California , said a trader can double or triple his 
company's profit by substituting cheap market power from the water-resources 
agency for power the company otherwise would generate. It is also free to 
resell the natural gas it might have used to fuel its plants. "That's what 
the trader is there to do and not leave money on the table," said Mr. Stout.

Davis spokesman under fire for stock 
By Amy Chance and Dale Kasler
Bee Staff Writers
(Published July 31, 2001) 
Davis administration spokesman Steve Maviglio acknowledged Monday that he 
bought stock in Calpine Corp. in June, at a time when the company was 
announcing a breakthrough in its bid to build a controversial San Jose power 
plant. 
His disclosure came several days after Gov. Gray Davis dismissed five state 
power purchasers for owning stock in the company and drew new complaints that 
Davis administration officials may have improperly mixed their private 
finances and their public roles. 
Maviglio, now acting as interim communications director for the 
administration, said he put in an "open" order for Calpine stock May 31, 
agreeing to buy 300 shares once the stock hit a certain price. 
He said that threshold was met June 20, the day after an action by the 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission brought down "all energy stock prices 
across the board." 
Maviglio said he bought the stock for his individual retirement account, and 
it has since declined in value. Under terms of the open order, he said, he 
had no control over the exact date of purchase. 
Maviglio touted the company in his role as spokesman to the governor in a 
story published June 27 in The Bee. He said Monday that he was simply 
responding to a reporter's question about the company's positive reputation. 
"They have made a clear commitment to invest in California's future," 
Maviglio said at the time. "Their pricing has been far more reasonable than 
any other generator." 
In the interview, Maviglio also contrasted Calpine and Texas-based 
generators. He said Calpine "took a different tack from the Joe Bobs of the 
world," an apparent reference to Joe Bob Perkins, a senior executive with 
Reliant Energy Inc. of Houston. 
Maviglio acknowledged the stock ownership several days after the 
administration ended its relationship with several energy consultants who 
held stock in energy companies, including Calpine. 
Under pressure from Secretary of State Bill Jones, a Republican who hopes to 
challenge Davis for governor next year, the Davis administration has spent 
several weeks scrambling to answer questions about the stock holdings and 
potential conflicts of its consultants and energy traders. 
Jones said Monday that Maviglio should be fired. 
"These actions are unethical, unconscionable, unacceptable, and heads should 
roll," he said in a statement. He said the Democratic governor should direct 
all of his staff to immediately file updated conflict-of-interest statements 
to reflect current holdings. 
Jones, who last week asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to 
investigate administration consultants for insider trading, also said the 
probe should be expanded "to include all of the governor's staff." 
Federal law and SEC regulations forbid anyone from trading stocks while 
possessing "insider information" -- relevant facts not available to the 
public, according to the SEC. Violations can bring lawsuits and criminal 
prosecution. 
Michael Prozan, a Menlo Park lawyer and expert on insider trading, said the 
prohibition against it originally focused on halting company executives from 
profiting from news before it was disclosed publicly. 
But the laws have been broadened to include others besides company employees. 
Investment bankers, lawyers and journalists have been snared by 
insider-trading crackdowns. 
Davis' office was instrumental earlier this year in paving the way for 
removing barriers to construction of a Calpine plant in San Jose. On May 30, 
after opposing the project for years, San Jose Mayor Ron Gonzales announced 
he had negotiated an agreement addressing his concerns and agreed to support 
construction. 
His action came after Davis in April endorsed the plant's construction and as 
the state Energy Commission threatened to approve it over local objections. 
On June 20, the company announced it had won tentative state approval to 
build the plant. 
Maviglio said he buys many stocks and that Enron Corp. and Calpine are the 
only energy generators among them. He owns 100 shares of Enron stock, which 
he purchased in 1996. 
"I deal with hundreds of California companies just about every day, and this 
was one that I saw that looked like a good investment based on public 
knowledge," he said. "I read six newspapers a day or more, and I know what's 
going on in the world. If there's a standard that I can't invest in something 
that I have general public knowledge of, then I wouldn't have any stocks at 
all." 
Maviglio said that the "open" order he placed meant that he could not have 
used inside information to make his stock purchase. 
"Had I had specific knowledge about a contract being signed or what actually 
happened in the office of the mayor of San Jose ... that would have been 
unrelated," Maviglio said. "There was no timing-based sequence to it." 
Calpine stock, despite the company's considerable success, has slipped in 
recent weeks because of general investor anxiety about the California energy 
crisis. 
The stock, which trades on the New York Stock Exchange, closed at $49.30 on 
May 31, the day Maviglio says he placed the purchase order. The order was 
executed as the stock dipped below $40 on June 20, closing that day at 
$39.85. 
The day before, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission announced a 
price-control plan that investors believed was damaging to generators' 
profits. On Monday, the stock closed at $37.13. 
Last week, the Davis administration stopped doing business with five energy 
traders under contract with the administration after Maviglio said 
administration lawyers "came to the determination that there are possible 
violations of the law or close to it." 
"It's not a crime to own energy stock," Maviglio said Monday. "The difference 
with these traders is they're making governmental decisions. They're 
committing the state's resources by spending money to buy power." 
Jim Knox, director of California Common Cause, said he believes the 
Governor's Office made critical errors while hiring staff to purchase energy 
for the state. 
"Had the Governor's Office gone to the trouble to have these people fill 
statements of economic interest, as they were required to do by law, they 
should have known this before they were hired and they shouldn't have been 
hired," Knox said.

Davis energy aide leaves -- without pay 
By Emily Bazar
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published July 31, 2001) 
A high-paid consultant to Gov. Gray Davis who came under fire for his 
dealings with a California utility has cut ties with the administration and 
won't be paid for work already completed. 
Under terms of a settlement made final Monday, former Clinton damage control 
specialist Chris Lehane will no longer help shape Davis' public response to 
the energy crisis. 
Neither Lehane nor partner Mark Fabiani -- who were hired by Davis in May on 
a six-month, $30,000-a-month contract -- will receive any money for their 
services. Fabiani left last month. 
Because Lehane and Fabiani each received at least $10,000 under contract with 
Southern California Edison in the past year, Lewis Uhler, president of the 
National Tax Limitation Committee, filed a lawsuit alleging that conflict of 
interest laws had been violated. 
But Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said Lehane and Fabiani were instrumental 
in persuading the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to limit the wholesale 
cost of power in the state. 
"Chris Lehane provided an invaluable service to the people of California in 
helping us get action after a yearlong wait from FERC," he said. "It's a 
shame that politics gets in the way of public service." 
Uhler, however, said he believes Lehane and Fabiani represent a larger 
problem in the Davis administration, and he pointed to the recent dismissal 
of energy traders who held stock in energy companies. 
"Doesn't anybody in the Governor's Office understand conflict of interest?" 
Uhler asked. 
"This is really sending a signal that the Governor's Office thinks that it is 
somehow above the law."

Power delivery efficiency questioned: Output at low-cost generating plants 
has been cut while costlier ones continue to operate.
By Carrie Peyton
Bee Staff Writer
(Published July 31, 2001) 
California is sometimes deliberately cutting output from low-cost power 
plants while running more expensive ones, utility and grid officials say. 
The sporadic episodes haven't cost much yet, but they illustrate a 
potentially troubling disconnect in the system that has quickly grown between 
two agencies that help deliver electricity to a power-strapped state. 
"We seem to be building this inefficiency into the system, and it doesn't 
seem to be getting better," said Mike Florio, a consumer advocate who sits on 
the governing board of the Independent System Operator. 
The trouble is that the ISO, created in 1996 to manage the power grid in a 
deregulated electric market, tries to run the grid by auctions that -- in 
theory -- provide the cheapest electricity for the state's consumers. 
Meanwhile, the state Department of Water Resources, which in January stepped 
in to buy power on behalf of cash-strapped utilities, isn't bidding at some 
auctions because it believes it can provide cheaper power if it doesn't. 
"We have an inefficient market and an inept government entity. It's sort of 
the worst of both worlds," Florio said, criticizing his agency and the DWR. 
ISO staffers decline to discuss the situation in detail, saying it involves 
confidential bidding behavior. 
But Pete Garris, chief of operations for the power-buying arm of the 
Department of Water Resources, confirmed that the ISO has been asking his 
agency to take part in more auctions, but the state has declined. 
The state's role is to buy electricity for customers of utilities whose 
credit was no longer good enough to buy on their own, he said. 
"We're not in it to do those kinds of marketing functions," he said. "It's 
not necessarily a good fit." 
Some of the ISO auctions are used to lessen congestion on transmission lines. 
Others are used to stabilize the grid by slightly increasing or decreasing 
output when demand doesn't match forecasts. 
Generally, the highest-cost power plants should be the ones cutting back, a 
process the industry calls "decking." 
But since May, on ISO orders, Southern California Edison has repeatedly 
throttled back on the Mohave Generating Station, which produces some of the 
cheapest power available to California today, costing as little as $10 to $20 
a megawatt-hour. 
Edison, which owns a majority share of Mohave, has cut its output by 5,660 
megawatt-hours between May and July, about one-half of 1 percent, at the 
ISO's behest, according to data Edison provided to The Bee. 
The ISO could probably have saved the state's consumers $370,000 at one plant 
if it had asked a higher-cost gas-burning plant to cut back instead of 
Mohave, a coal-burning workhorse in Laughlin, Nev., Florio said. 
The amount sounds like "small potatoes," but in some ways it is more alarming 
than the $14 million the state lost recently by selling excess power for less 
than it paid, he said. 
Industry experts agree that such below-cost sales are common in a business 
where power needs fluctuate dramatically based on the weather. 
By contrast, "this is a dead weight loss. Higher costs are being incurred for 
no good reason," Florio said. 
"The question is, why is the ISO calling on Mohave and not (cheaper) gas 
plants? The answer is, the gas plants aren't bidding ... probably because 
they're contracted with DWR," he said. 
Four Corners, another low-cost coal plant partly owned by Edison, has also 
been throttled back at ISO request, Edison officials said. 
In addition, so few bidders have shown up at ISO auctions to ease stress on 
transmission lines that the system has fallen into disarray, with the ISO 
instead ordering across-the-board power production cuts that are boosting 
costs, Florio said. 
For its part, the ISO will say only that "we are making the most economical 
decisions we can based on the bids available," said spokeswoman Stephanie 
McCorkle. 
DWR's Garris said the state and the ISO have been meeting repeatedly on 
bidding and other coordination issues, and he hopes to have a 
smoother-running system in place by next summer.

Davis: FERC excluding $5 billion of owed refunds 
By Jim Sanders
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published July 31, 2001) 
A ruling by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission last week could cost 
Californians $5 billion in energy refunds, according to Gov. Gray Davis, who 
filed a formal request Monday for a rehearing in the case. 
Although the commission's order suggested that California is owed refunds 
because of exorbitant electricity prices during the recent energy crisis, the 
order's fine print placed severe limits on such refunds, Davis said. 
"FERC is up to its old tricks again," he said. "They talk about refunds for 
California. But in this case, talk really is cheap: The details of its latest 
order show it has no intention of making California whole." 
Tamara Young-Allen, a FERC spokeswoman, declined comment Monday and said the 
agency does not discuss pending cases. 
California is seeking $8.9 billion in alleged overcharges for electricity 
purchased from May 2000 to June 19, when FERC imposed new rules to prevent 
price gouging. 
On Wednesday, FERC ordered hearings to determine precisely how much money 
electricity generators would have to pay in refunds to California. 
At the time, Davis applauded FERC's ruling, saying it validates California's 
claim that "significant refunds are due" and that the agency's action "gets 
us closer to realizing that refund." 
But after poring over details of the 40-page order, state officials said 
Monday that it excludes from consideration more than half the amount sought 
by the state -- leaving $3.9 billion in dispute. 
Attorney Barry Goode and Nancy McFadden, key members of Davis' energy team, 
said the FERC order would not allow refunds: 
For about $2 billion in alleged overcharges stemming from electricity 
purchased by Californians between May and October of last year. 
For electricity bought by the state Department of Water Resources from 
private companies this year. The state says it is owed about $3 billion from 
such purchases. 
The FERC ruling means that only DWR's purchases through the state's 
now-defunct Power Exchange or through the operator of a statewide electricity 
transmission grid will be considered for refunds, officials said. 
Such limitations by the regulatory agency are impractical because the market 
was dysfunctional, leaving DWR with few options, when the state began buying 
electricity for debt-strapped private utilities in January, Goode said. 
"Now FERC says Californians are not entitled to refunds even though they 
determined the prices were excessively high," Davis said. "It's time for FERC 
to decide who they are working for: the greedy out-of-state generators or the 
people of California." 
The motion filed Monday sets the stage for a possible lawsuit. 
"We are calling on FERC to change its order," Davis said. "If it doesn't, we 
will be in court."

Bill would streamline the path to local power: More cities, including Davis, 
are taking a look at creating municipal utility districts. 
By Ed Fletcher
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published July 31, 2001) 
With the future of California's investor-owned utilities clouded by the 
state's energy crisis, more and more cities, including Davis, are looking to 
control their own power destinies. 
Cities, public-power advocates and state Sen. Nell Soto, D-Pomona, are 
pushing a bill through the state Legislature that would make it easier to 
create municipal utility districts. 
"My solution to the power crisis is to reassert our interests and declare our 
independence from out-of-state gougers and in-state irresponsible utility 
companies," said Soto, who is carrying the bill, SB 23xx. 
The Senate approved the bill earlier this month. The Assembly is expected to 
take it up when the Legislature reconvenes in mid-August. The state's three 
investor-owned utilities are fighting the proposal. 
Davis and other cities look longingly at the Sacramento Municipal Utility 
District's success in sheltering ratepayers from the brunt of rate increases. 
Given the cloudy financial future of Davis' power provider, Pacific Gas and 
Electric Co., public power supporters say it's easy to understand why cities 
want local control. If run well, public power can be cheaper and more stable 
than that supplied by investor-owned utility companies, they say. 
"You get to choose the type of energy you want. ... I can't think of a bad 
reason" to have public power, said Robert Milbrodt, a Davis resident active 
in the drive. 
After Yolo County officials last year denied an effort to form a public power 
authority in Davis, the city is ready to take a fresh look. The city, which 
did not formally support last year's attempt, this week is expected to name 
members to a public power task force. It is also hiring a consultant to help 
evaluate the pros and cons of a Davis version of SMUD. 
Soto's bill would create a path to public power that takes county local 
agency formation commissions out of the process. Under the bill, if all the 
cities and counties affected by the proposed municipal utility district sign 
on, the plan bypasses the local LAFCO, goes directly to the California Pubic 
Utilities Commission for analysis and then to the voters of the affected 
areas. 
It was the Yolo County Local Agency Formation Commission that turned down the 
Davis request a year ago, saying critical issues were unresolved. Davis 
public power activists said their plan would have put the basic formation 
question before the voters, leaving the details to be worked out later. 
Public power boosters said lobbying by PG&E doomed their plans. 
SB 23xx also simplifies the approval process, allowing a simple majority of 
voters in the proposed district to create the new power district. 
Seizing transformers, power lines and other utility company infrastructure 
through eminent domain would become much easier for agencies starting 
municipal utility districts under the bill. A utility company would not be 
able to challenge the taking of property based on the merits, but could only 
fight over price. 
The utility companies say the provision would take away a key protection 
against abuse. 
Surveys show Californians like the idea of local officials controlling their 
power, in part because they blame investor-owned utilities for the state's 
electricity mess. 
Nearly two-thirds say local governments taking the place of investor-owned 
utilities would be a good thing, according to a poll released earlier this 
month by the Public Policy Institute of California. 
There are those that warn, however, that pubic power is not without risk. 
"This bill does not address generation," said Dale Hunter, a PG&E lobbyist, 
and municipal utility districts that can't generate their own power will be 
"exposing ratepayers to the volatility of the (power purchasing) market." 
In Los Angeles, the Department of Water and Power has been highly successful 
because it has surplus power to sell, Hunter said. SMUD has only recently 
been forced to raise its rates largely because it generates some of its 
power, Hunter said. 
By creating a way around LAFCOs, shifting the Public Utilities Commission to 
an advisory role and stripping the right of utility companies to fight in 
court, the bill would be removing important public safeguards, Hunter said.

SDG&E denies it deceived ratepayers about debt

Company calls gain on sales, debts 'separate transactions' By Craig D. Rose  
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER  July 31, 2001  San Diego Gas & Electric yesterday 
denied allegations that it systematically lied about the debt it racked up 
during the power crisis, despite revelations that the company earned hundreds 
of millions from some power sales.  SDG&E and its parent company, Sempra 
Energy, acknowledged making profits from selling electricity but insisted 
those gains have no bearing on the $750 million debt the utility claims to be 
owed by customers for power purchases during the energy crisis.  "Those are 
completely separate transactions," said Ed Van Herik, a spokesman for SDG&E. 
The company's effort to seal a deal with the state to clear the $750 million 
debt has come under attack by the Utility Consumers' Action Network. The San 
Diego-based consumer group says SDG&E's claimed debt is the result of 
selective bookkeeping, bordering on fraud.  The bottom line, says UCAN, is 
that SDG&E engaged in deception and probably owes its customers money.  
SDG&E, which claimed to have sold customers electricity without markups, 
actually "was buying electricity at a low price and selling it at a higher 
price to us," said Shames. "SDG&E customers have been systematically lied to 
over the past year about this balancing account."  UCAN says that SDG&E 
earned an estimated $450 million from its power sales to the state, while 
publicly declaring that it was posting only losses from buying power.  Shames 
said much of the information leading to UCAN's conclusion came from a 
detailed analysis of documents made available in recent weeks.  The state 
Office of Ratepayer Advocates, meanwhile, yesterday said a new filing by 
SDG&E that claims its power-sales profits belong to stockholders, not 
consumers, is "specious" and "without merit."  Van Herik insisted the company 
had not been misleading. The spokesman noted that the company earlier was 
required to buy electricity from the Power Exchange, a now-defunct 
marketplace established by the state as part of its deregulation plan.  "What 
we said is that we were buying electricity for our customers and passing 
along the cost without markup," said Van Herik.  What SDG&E failed to 
publicly announce was that it was simultaneously selling electricity to the 
Power Exchange for an apparently healthy profit.  Under certain contracts, 
SDG&E had locked in electricity at prices substantially below going rates 
during the ongoing power crisis. The company declined yesterday to reveal 
terms of the contracts. But UCAN estimates the contracts provided electricity 
to the utility at no more than 5 cents per kilowatt-hour.  SDG&E then sold 
that relatively cheap power to the Power Exchange for a higher price and 
pocketed the profit, which it also declined to disclose.  As it profited from 
the power sales, SDG&E bought power at higher prices from the exchange and 
billed customers for what it paid.  Whenever SDG&E's costs to buy electricity 
exceeded what state regulators would allow the utility to charge customers, 
it recorded the amounts in balancing accounts. That account grew to $750 
million.  But SDG&E never offset its losses from electricity purchases with 
its profit from sales.  Van Herik said the practice was appropriate because 
the lucrative contracts for cheap power were owned by the company's 
shareholders, not its customers. The practice of keeping profits and losses 
entirely separate, he said, was endorsed by a California Public Utilities 
Commission audit.  But the first formal ruling on that matter came in June, 
when the full commission ruled that all profits from SDG&E's contractual 
power deals belong to its customers.  SDG&E went to court to overturn the 
commission's ruling, but put the legal effort on hold shortly before Sempra 
reached a tentative agreement with the state to clear the $750 million debt. 
The proposal with the state would reverse the utilities commission ruling and 
award the company's shareholders ownership of the profits SDG&E made from 
selling power.  Van Herik said yesterday that the state made the concession 
because it recognized that SDG&E had a strong legal case.  But Shames says 
the state had a strong case and noted that the Office of Ratepayer Advocates 
agreed. He is asking the utilities commission to reject the deal.  State Sen. 
Steve Peace, D-El Cajon, said he believes that consumer objections to the 
balancing account deal are aimed at getting ratepayers a better deal -- and 
that's something he supports.  "If Michael Shames can improve on the 
balancing account deal I'm in full support as long as we don't lose any of 
the gains we've already gotten," he said.  A spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis 
did not return a telephone call seeking reaction to the UCAN allegations.  
Outside UCAN's office in Little Italy yesterday, a group of trade unionists 
demonstrated in support of SDG&E's position. Dave Moore, a business manager 
for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 465, said SDG&E 
has handled its power purchases in accordance with utilities commission 
rulings.  But Shames said the company sought to shield its actions from the 
scrutiny of consumer groups and the public.  "They consistently said they 
were not making money from this," said the consumer advocate. "For them to 
split hairs and say, 'We didn't make money from purchases, we made it from 
sales,' is disingenuous."  Staff writer Bill Ainsworth contributed to this 
report. 







Sempra set to unveil plans for new plant, business park  


\
objattph 
By Jonathan Heller  UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER  July 31, 2001  ESCONDIDO -- 
City officials are expecting to get their first look today at long-awaited 
plans to build the largest power plant in North County since the Encina plant 
came on line more than 30 years ago.  Sempra Energy Resources will file a 
200-page application with the city Planning Department for a 550-megawatt, 
natural gas-fired power plant and roughly 100-acre business park in southwest 
Escondido, Sempra spokesman Tom Murnane said.  "It (the application) is very 
detailed," Murnane said. "We have not done an application of this sort 
before. This is the first time Sempra Energy Resources has been involved in 
the development of a business park."  Sempra is building the project in 
partnership with JRM Real Estate, a Carlsbad-based developer.  The California 
Energy Commission will have final say on the power plant, which could take 
three to four years to get on line. The City Council will decide on the 
industrial park.  City officials have awaited Sempra's bid ever since the 
idea was broached in January. The project addresses two needs: The power 
plant would provide enough energy to power almost a half-million homes, and 
the business park would bring higher-paying jobs to a city with the lowest 
median income in North County.  "I'm awaiting with great anticipation to see 
what they have planned," said City Councilwoman June Rady. "I have met with 
Sempra officials several times in the past and what they have shared with me 
I've been very excited about."  Sempra has promised that its proposed plant 
would have lower emission levels than any plant now in the state. The company 
also has said the plant would not have a tall smokestack, or a visible vapor 
plume such as the one produced by the city's Iceoplex generating plant.  The 
plant and park are slated for Quail Hills, the last large parcel of vacant 
industrial land in the city. Several previous plans by other developers have 
failed after they discovered the high costs involved with building on the 
hilly terrain.  Neighbors near the area have voiced concerns about noise, 
traffic and dust associated with rock crushing, which would be needed to 
create level foundations for the project.






Davis press secretary confirms buying energy company stock  


\
objattph 
ASSOCIATED PRESS  July 31, 2001  SACRAMENTO ) Gov. Gray Davis' press 
secretary recently purchased the same energy stock as five consultants the 
governor fired last week, he disclosed Monday.  Steve Maviglio confirmed that 
on June 20, he bought 300 shares of stock in Calpine Corp., a San Jose-based 
power generator that has received about $13 billion in state contracts to 
supply electricity for up to 20 years.  Maviglio's disclosure comes after 
Davis' office hastily ended the contracts of five consultants who helped 
negotiate state power contracts and held stock in energy companies.  In a 
related development, an anonymous source told the Los Angeles Times on Monday 
that the Securities and Exchange Commission has launched a preliminary 
inquiry into whether the consultants used inside information to trade the 
energy stocks.  About two dozen Davis energy consultants were required to 
fill out financial disclosure statements after complaints of conflict of 
interest by Republicans and consumer groups.  "When we reviewed them, we 
found possible violations of the law and took swift action," Maviglio said 
Monday before Secretary of State Bill Jones issued a press release calling 
for his termination.  Jones, a Republican, is a candidate for the GOP 
nomination to challenge Davis in November 2002.  Maviglio defended his 
purchase, saying that he "owns several stocks in companies in all fields that 
are growing and are based in California."  Maviglio said Monday that he 
requested on May 31 to purchase the stock if it dipped to $40 a share, which 
it did two days after a June 18 ruling by federal energy regulators 
restricting wholesale electricity prices in California and 10 other states.  
Maviglio served as Davis' chief spokesman urging the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission to impose price ceilings on electricity wholesalers.  
He also said he owns between $10,000 and $100,000 stock in Houston-based 
Enron Corp. He said he purchased the stock in 1997 and has reported it on 
financial disclosure forms. He said that it is "closer to $10,000."  
Meanwhile, two energy consultants to Davis have agreed to forgo more than 
$50,000 in work they did for the state.  Chris Lehane and Mark Fabiani will 
forgo the payments as part of a settlement with a Sacramento-area resident 
who filed a lawsuit objecting to their hiring, calling it a conflict of 
interest.  Fabiani could not be reached for comment Monday. In the 
settlement, they admitted no wrongdoing.  Lehane issued a statement through 
the governor's office, calling it "simply not worth the bother to challenge 
the controller in court."  Davis has come under fire for his May hiring of 
Lehane, former press secretary for Vice President Al Gore, and Fabiani, a 
deputy campaign manager for Gore's presidential run.  They were hired to help 
shape Davis' response to the energy crisis, and helped craft Davis' 
aggressive attack on Texas-based energy companies and President Bush.  Both 
also have advised Southern California Edison, which is negotiating for state 
help in avoiding bankruptcy. Financial disclosure forms showed they have each 
received at least $10,000 from Edison in the past year.  Davis announced at 
the end of June that Fabiani terminated his contract, and Davis scaled back 
Lehane's role with the state.  State Controller Kathleen Connell then said 
she would not pay Lehane and Fabiani for any of their work and now the two 
have agreed they will not fight her decision, Maviglio said.  Lewis K. Uhler, 
the Placer County man who filed the lawsuit, said the settlement 
"accomplished our objectives."  "We wanted to block the egregious use of 
taxpayer funds for essentially political spinmeisters," he said. Uhler is 
president of the Roseville-based National Tax Limitation Committee.  Maviglio 
said that Fabiani and Lehane "did good work for the state" and helped the 
state win victories with federal regulators. 






THE STATE
Davis' Energy Advisors Draw SEC Attention
Probe: Under review is the possible use of inside information to buy power 
company stocks. GOP rival of governor requested the inquiry.
By WALTER HAMILTON JEFFERY L. RABIN and DARYL KELLEY
TIMES STAFF WRITERS

July 31 2001

The Securities and Exchange Commission has launched a preliminary inquiry 
into whether energy consultants advising Gov. Gray Davis used inside 
information to trade stocks of power companies doing business with the state, 
a source with knowledge of the matter said Monday.

The federal agency began its review late last week, the source said, in 
response to a request from California Secretary of State Bill Jones. A 
Republican rival of Davis, Jones charged that stock trading by consultants 
may have violated federal laws barring buying and selling based on 
information not available to the public.

On Friday, top aides to the governor disclosed that five consultants had been 
fired for possible conflicts of interest between their official positions and 
their personal finances. As news of the SEC inquiry spread through the 
capital Monday, Davis officials were confronted by a flurry of questions 
about who in the administration owns energy stocks.

Financial disclosure records filed by the governor's spokesman, Steve 
Maviglio, show that he owns between $10,000 and $100,000 in a Texas company 
he and his boss have accused of making "obscene" profits while California has 
been "on its knees." Maviglio said he bought the shares in Houston-based 
Enron Corp. in 1996.

"It's not a crime to own energy stock," Maviglio said.

He also owns 300 shares of San Jose-based Calpine Corp., which has the 
largest share of the $43 billion in long-term state power contracts.

Maviglio placed the order for the stock on May 31, one day after San Jose's 
mayor dropped his opposition to a controversial Calpine plant favored by the 
governor and others. Under the terms of Maviglio's purchase, the transaction 
was completed about three weeks later when the stock reached $40 a share, a 
value of $12,000. It has since fallen in value.

"I viewed it as a good long-term investment," Maviglio said, adding that he 
purchased the shares for his retirement account based on publicly available 
information.

The Davis administration has spared Calpine the kind of fierce criticisms 
that it has leveled at other electricity suppliers, such as Enron. But 
California's grid operator has identified the company as one of many energy 
merchants to overcharge the state millions of dollars.

The fired consultants also owned shares in Calpine, ranging in value from 
several thousand dollars to more than $100,000, records show.

Another top Davis administration official, legal affairs secretary Barry 
Goode, disclosed in his economic interest statement that he recently held 
between $100,000 and $1 million in another out-of-state company accused of 
multimillion-dollar price gouging.

In a statement, Goode said he sold his stock in Williams Co's. a month after 
he began working for the governor in February. Goode said the shares were 
supposed to be sold before he went on the state payroll, but his broker 
failed to do so.

In light of the recent disclosures, Secretary of State Jones said the 
governor must do more to ensure the public that its interest comes first.

"The governor should direct all of his staff to immediately file updated 
conflict of interest statements that reflect current holdings and any 
activity since their last statement of economic interest was filed," said 
Jones, who is seeking the GOP nomination for governor.

Word of the SEC's entry into California's energy problems comes as the 
governor faces harsh criticism from lawmakers and others for the quick and 
broad hiring of highly paid private consultants to guide him through the 
crisis.

In his written request to the SEC, Jones said that recently filed disclosure 
documents showed that at least one consultant bought and sold shares of two 
energy companies within the same month, raising "a red flag" about the 
possibility of insider trading.

State law prohibits officials from participating in decisions involving their 
personal financial interests.

The five consultants fired last week were among 11 named in Jones' letter, 
delivered to the San Francisco office of the SEC last Wednesday. It was not 
clear which individuals are the focus of the SEC's inquiry, or whether the 
agency's review would result in any charges.

Two of the former traders said Monday that they had not been contacted by 
federal investigators and knew nothing of an inquiry into possible insider 
trading.

But William Mead, fired Thursday, said it is no mystery why so many of his 
colleagues owned Calpine stock.

Mead said he bought it 2 1/2 years ago and made so much money he recommended 
it to his colleagues last year, while they all still worked for the 
now-defunct California Power Exchange in Alhambra. Calpine power was not 
traded on that exchange, so there was no conflict of interest, he said.

Mead and three other energy traders--hired by the state in February and 
March--were terminated by the Davis administration for allegedly buying power 
for the state from Calpine while owning the company's stock. Fired traders 
Herman Leung, Peggy Cheng and Constantine Louie did not list the date of 
their Calpine purchases on financial statements that the state required to be 
filed only two weeks ago.

"But I'm sure they bought it while they were still at the power exchange, 
because that's when we discussed it," Mead said. "It was kind of like a 
hobby. I'm sure it wasn't done with the intent to manipulate."

Former trader Elaine Griffin, who also owned Calpine stock and resigned two 
weeks ago to take another job, said she didn't know she owned energy 
securities until she checked with her financial advisor July 13, just before 
leaving her state job.

Griffin said she and her husband own about $10,000 worth of Calpine stock in 
individual retirement accounts managed by their advisor, who bought the stock 
Feb. 1 without their knowledge, she said, after research found it to be a 
good investment.

"I kind of feel like we've been used for political reasons," Griffin said. 
"We would have disclosed anything right at first, but they never asked."

As a trader, Griffin said she occasionally bought Calpine power for the 
state, but only at market prices.

Meanwhile, two Democratic political consultants, who helped Davis polish his 
image after the ongoing energy crisis caused his poll numbers to plummet, 
have agreed to accept no payment for their work as part of an out-of-court 
settlement of a taxpayer lawsuit.

Tom Hiltachk, a lawyer for conservative anti-tax activist Lewis Uhler, said 
the settlement was reached last Friday after negotiations with lawyers for 
communications consultants Mark Fabiani and Chris Lehane.

"Now they will not receive one red cent," said Hiltachk. "Very simply Mr. 
Fabiani and Mr. Lehane have agreed to cease all activities for the governor, 
to accept no payments for their services and to basically get out of the 
consulting business with the governor."

As his part of the agreement, Hiltachk said, Uhler withdrew his lawsuit 
Monday morning.

Uhler had filed a lawsuit against the two consultants and Controller Kathleen 
Connell in June contending that they should not receive any payments because 
of a conflict of interest. The two men also did consulting work for 
financially troubled Southern California Edison, which was seeking help from 
Davis and the Legislature.

Connell, a former Los Angeles mayoral candidate who has been at odds with 
Davis since he endorsed an opponent, had held up the payments pending the 
outcome of the lawsuit.

Under an agreement with Davis, the men were to have been paid $30,000 a month 
for six months.

Fabiani and Lehane could not be reached for comment.

(07-31) 07:23 PDT SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- 
Gov. Gray Davis' press secretary says he owns stock in the same energy 
company as five state consultants who were fired because of possible conflict 
of interest. 
Steve Maviglio confirmed Monday that on June 20 he bought 300 shares of stock 
in Calpine Corp., a San Jose-based power generator that has received about 
$13 billion in state contracts to supply electricity for up to 20 years. 
Secretary of State Bill Jones called for Maviglio's termination. Jones is a

The five energy consultants were fired last week because they owned shares in 
Calpine and also had helped the state buy electricity from the company. "We 
did not want them making governmental decisions and holding these stocks," 
said Barry Goode, the governor's legal affairs secretary. 
An anonymous source told the Los Angeles Times on Monday that the Securities

PG&E's $500,000,000 second-quarter surprise

U213760.DTL>
PG&E Corp. said yesterday that it will earn $500 million to $600 million more 
than anticipated in the second quarter because its bankrupt utility was able 
to buy cheaper electricity in March as wholesale prices dropped. 
As a consequence, PG&E reduced the amount of money it says the utility, 
Pacific Gas and Electric Co., lost during California's energy crisis from 
$5.2 billion to between $4.6 billion and $4.7 billion. 
"Its a good thing for PG&E," said Paul Fremont, an energy industry analyst 
with Jefferies & Co., an investment bank in New York. "But it clearly does 
not get them to the level where they are able to emerge from bankruptcy and 
make all of their creditors whole." 
The disclosure by PG&E Corp. yesterday adds a modest boost to its quarterly 
earnings report, set for tomorrow morning. The company is expected to report 
an operating profit of 71 cents per share, according to analysts polled by 
Thomson Financial/First Call, an investment research firm. 
PG&E Corp. is the owner of Pacific Gas & Electric Co., which filed for 
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April after electricity prices soared 
this year. The utility had previously estimated that it lost $1.1 billion in 
the first quarter and $4.1 billion in the fourth because it was prohibited by 
the state Public Utilities Commission from passing higher costs on to 
consumers. 
PG&E Corp. also includes a energy producing unit, which generally makes 
money, and a venture capital arm. Neither of those divisions is affected by 
the utility's bankruptcy. 
The utility said it got a small break in March as the price it was paying to 
the California Independent System Operator for energy declined sharply. The 
unanticipated drop was attributed to declining demand because of energy 
conservation, low tempera- 
tures and the opening of new power plants in the state. 
The utility also benefited from the cancellation of power contracts by 
companies that did not want to do business with a bankrupt partner. Those 
contracts were for selling power at below cost. 
What is the utility's gain, though, may be a negative for PG&E's power- 
producing division. The lower prices could mean the energy-producing group 
will make less money from its sales, analysts said.

GOV. GRAY DAVIS seems to have an ethical blind spot when it comes to the 
hiring of outsiders to help manage California's energy crisis. 
Throughout the crisis, Davis has been intolerably slow in responding to 
questions about whether certain members of his inner circle -- drawing big 
checks off the public payroll -- might have possible financial conflicts. 
As of yesterday, the governor's office still has not required 16 contractors 
to file public disclosure documents that would reveal whether they have any 
financial stake in companies affected by policies they help develop. 
Steve Maviglio, the governor's press secretary, said 42 energy "consultants" 
have filed their economic disclosure statements. But he said the other 16 
were "contractors" -- without actual decisionmaking authority -- and were 
thus not required to fill out the forms. 
Maviglio's "contractor versus consultant" distinctions are technical and 
semantic. His spin simply doesn't wash. 
The bottom line is that "contractors" who are making big decisions involving 
big dollars for the state are not playing by the same rules as others in the 
public trust. 
For example, Davis has exempted two Wall Street executives, Joseph Fichera 
and Michael Hoffman, who are putting together a rescue plan that involves a 
$12.5 billion bond issue. They are getting $275,000 a month for their advice. 
Yet they have not been required to fill out disclosure forms, which would 
allow the governor -- and any other Californian -- to assess whether a 
potential conflict exists. 
"They told us they don't have any conflicts," said Maviglio, who, 
incidentally, confirmed yesterday that in June he bought $12,000 worth of 
stock in the Calpine Corp., the generating company with the largest chunk of 
state power contracts. On July 2, Davis publicly praised Calpine as "the most 
responsible of the generators." 
Davis should have finally learned his lesson last week after having to fire 
five consultants -- all involved in energy trading -- when their belatedly 
filed disclosure forms showed serious potential conflicts. A sixth consultant 
quit. Four of those traders owned Calpine shares. 
A week earlier, the Davis administration was forced to order a group of 
consultants to hastily unload their power-company holdings or lose their 
contracts. 
The governor's office also has been stung by revelations that political 
consultants Chris Lehane and Mark Fabiani, hired at $30,000 a month to 
develop energy-related "communications strategies," also had a contract with 
Southern California Edison. 
Moreover, some of the disclosure forms that have been filed to date have been 
less than complete, especially regarding the timing of the buying and selling 
of energy stocks. 
How many scandals will it take for Davis to insist on full disclosure -- and 
the highest ethical standards -- of everyone who is working for him on the 
energy crisis?

S.F. to vote on electric power to the people 
Measures would start public utility districts

San Francisco -- After decades of trying to persuade San Francisco to take 
control of its electrical system, advocates of public power now have the 
issue before city voters. 
"The timing couldn't be better," said consumer advocate Medea Benjamin, co- 
director of San Francisco's Global Exchange. 
"It's not just the threat of blackouts or the highest rate hikes in history. 
It's the fact that PG&E is in bankruptcy. It's the depletion of the state 
budget," she said. "This is a hell of an opportunity." 
The opportunity she is talking about centers on two November ballot measures 
that would pave the way for creating a public power system and taking Pacific 
Gas and Electric Co. out of the city's electricity market. 
Under the proposed measures, an elected board of directors would set the 
rates and have control over everything from the terms for buying electricity 
to whether to use more renewable energy sources, such as wind, hydroelectric 
and solar power. 
Public power would base policies "on a more localized basis, where the values 
of an individual community can be put into practice," said Ed Smeloff, a 
longtime public power advocate who was recently hired as an assistant general 
manager at the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission. 
One proposal, an initiative placed on the ballot by residents, calls for 
setting up a municipal utility district in San Francisco and neighboring 
Brisbane. The district would be governed by an elected board of directors. 
The other measure, placed on the ballot last week by the Board of 
Supervisors, would create a municipal water and power agency and would affect 
only San Francisco. 
PG&E has mounted a campaign to defeat the measures, so far pumping more than 
$200,000 into the effort. 
"We think the (ballot proposals) are a bad idea," said Frank Gallagher, 
spokesman for the Coalition for Affordable Public Services, the PG&E-financed 
group fighting the measures. "They're confusing and do nothing to address the 
problem." 
The company has a history of opposing public power proposals, derailing a 
plan in Davis in the 1990s and using a legal challenge to stall the start of 
Sacramento's Municipal Utility District for two decades. 
For years, private utilities have enjoyed a powerful hold on state and local 
politicians. But the energy crisis has caused widespread public anger and 
concern, forcing city and state officials to take another look at public 
power. 
A poll conducted this month by the Public Policy Institute of California, a 
nonpartisan think tank in San Francisco, found that nearly two-thirds of 
Californians support the replacement of private electric companies with 
municipal power authorities formed by local governments. 
San Francisco already owns a power system, Hetch Hetchy, which provides power 
for city departments. PG&E provides power to residents and businesses. 
The San Francisco Charter amendment placed on the ballot by the supervisors 
calls for abolishing the city's existing Public Utilities Commission, which 
is run by commissioners and a director appointed by the mayor. The proposed 
public power board would have seven elected directors, but the agency still 
would retain some ties to City Hall. 
The supervisors' plan is intended to be used as a backup to the municipal 
utility district -- commonly known as a MUD -- which is considered to be more 
vulnerable to the expected legal challenges from PG&E. 
"It's a great marriage, and will ensure that we get public power in San 
Francisco," said Board of Supervisors President Tom Ammiano, chief sponsor of 
the board's measure. 
San Francisco is not alone in looking at public power. San Diego, the first 
city to feel the hard pinch of the energy crisis, wants to establish a 
regional public power system in an attempt to pool resources and bring down 
energy costs. 
The East Bay Municipal Utility District, which provides water and sewer 
service, is considering expanding its reach to power. In the Bay Area, the 
cities of Alameda and Palo Alto already have public power. The two largest 
public power agencies in the state serve Los Angeles and Sacramento. 
In San Francisco, the pro-public power forces are going to tout the promised 
virtues of turning the electric utility over to a public authority that by 
law cannot turn a profit. That, they contend, means lower rates. 
"It's an expectation, but it's also tried and true," said Ross Mirkarimi, 
campaign director of MUD Now, the group sponsoring the ballot initiative. 
On average, consumers pay 18 percent less for power from public utilities, he 
said. 
Gallagher, spokesman for the opposition campaign, said ratepayers shouldn't 
assume that public power means lower energy bills. "There's no way the rates 
are going down," he said. 
He blamed the energy crisis not on deregulation but on a shortage of 
electricity, which jacked up prices and undercut reliability. 
"The measures do nothing about supply," Gallagher said. "All this will do is 
cost people money. You can't just take PG&E's assets. You have to pay for 
them."

Davis' advisers probed by SEC 
Published Tuesday, July 31, 2001, in the San Jose Mercury News 
BY WALTER HAMILTON, JEFFERY L. RABIN AND DARYL KELLEY 

Los Angeles Times 


The Securities and Exchange Commission has launched a preliminary inquiry 
into whether energy consultants advising California Gov. Gray Davis used 
inside information to trade stocks of power companies doing business with the 
state, a source with knowledge of the matter said Monday. 
The federal agency began its review late last week, the source said, in 
response to a request from California Secretary of State Bill Jones, who is 
seeking the GOP nomination for governor. Jones charged that stock trading by 
consultants may have violated federal laws barring buying and selling based 
on information not available to the public. 
On Friday, top aides to the governor disclosed that five consultants had been 
fired for possible conflicts of interest between their official positions and 
their personal finances. 
In addition, financial disclosure records filed by the governor's spokesman, 
Steve Maviglio, show that he owns between $10,000 and $100,000 in a Texas 
company he and his boss have accused of making ``obscene'' profits while 
California has been ``on its knees.'' Maviglio said he bought the shares in 
Houston-based Enron Corp. in 1996. 
``It's not a crime to own energy stock,'' Maviglio said. 
Calpine purchase 
He also owns 300 shares of San Jose-based Calpine Corp., which has the 
largest share of the $43 billion in long-term state power contracts. 
Maviglio placed an order for the stock with an electronic broker May 31, one 
day after San Jose Mayor Ron Gonzales dropped his opposition to a 
controversial Calpine plant under pressure from the governor and others. 
Under the terms of Maviglio's instructions, the stock was automatically 
purchased on his behalf when Calpine fell to $40 a share, according Hilary 
McLean, a spokeswoman for the governor. It has since fallen in value. 
``I viewed it as a good long-term investment,'' Maviglio said, adding that he 
purchased the shares for his retirement account based on publicly available 
information. 
The Davis administration has spared Calpine the kind of fierce criticisms it 
has leveled at other electricity suppliers, such as Enron. But California's 
grid operator has identified the company as one of many energy merchants to 
overcharge the state millions of dollars. 
The fired consultants also owned shares in Calpine, ranging in value from 
several thousand dollars to more than $100,000, records show. 
Another top Davis administration official, legal affairs secretary Barry 
Goode, disclosed in his economic interest statement that he recently held 
between $100,000 and $1 million in another out-of-state company accused of 
multimillion-dollar price gouging. 
In a statement, Goode said he sold his stock in Williams Co's. a month after 
he began working for the governor in February. Goode said the shares were 
supposed to be sold before he went on the state payroll but his broker failed 
to do so. 
In light of the recent disclosures, the secretary of state said the governor 
must do more to assure the public that its interest comes first. 
``The governor should direct all of his staff to immediately file updated 
conflict of interest statements that reflect current holdings and any 
activity since their last statement of economic interest was filed,'' Jones 
said. 
Word of the SEC's entry into California's energy problems comes as the 
governor faces harsh criticism from lawmakers and others for the quick and 
broad hiring of highly paid private consultants to guide him through the 
crisis. 
In his written request to the SEC, Jones said that recently filed disclosure 
documents showed that at least one consultant bought and sold shares of two 
energy companies within the same month, raising ``a red flag'' about the 
possibility of insider trading. 
State law prohibits officials from participating in decisions involving their 
personal financial interests. 
The five consultants fired last week were among 11 named in Jones' letter, 
delivered to the San Francisco office of the SEC last Wednesday. It was not 
clear which individuals are the focus of the SEC's inquiry, or whether the 
agency's review would result in any charges. 
Two of the former traders said Monday that they had not been contacted by 
federal investigators and knew nothing of an inquiry into possible insider 
trading. 
But William Mead, fired Thursday, said it's no mystery why so many of his 
colleagues owned Calpine stock. 
Mead said he bought it 2 1/2 years ago and made so much money he recommended 
it to his colleagues last year, while they all still worked for the 
now-defunct California Power Exchange in Alhambra. Calpine was not traded on 
that exchange, so there was no conflict of interest, he said. 
Traders fired 
Mead and three other energy traders -- hired by the state in February and 
March -- were terminated by the Davis administration for allegedly buying 
power from Calpine while owning the company's stock. Fired traders Herman 
Leung, Peggy Cheng and Constantine Louie did not list the date of their 
Calpine purchases on financial statements that the state required to be filed 
only two weeks ago. 
``But I'm sure they bought it while they were still at the power exchange, 
because that's when we discussed it,'' Mead said. ``It was kind of like a 
hobby. I'm sure it wasn't done with the intent to manipulate.''

Ethics issue in stock buy? 
A top Davis aide bought shares in a power company dealing with the state. 
July 31, 2001 
By JOHN HOWARD
The Orange County Register 
SACRAMENTO A top aide to Gov. Gray Davis bought stock in a power company that 
received a long-term contract with the state, the latest in a series of 
energy investments that have cast an ethical cloud over the state's 
electricity purchases. 
Steven Maviglio, Davis' press secretary and acting communications director, 
ordered through his broker 300 shares of San Jose-based Calpine Corp. stock 
May 31, to take effect when it dropped to $40 per share. It dropped below 
that June 20 and Maviglio purchased $12,000 worth, he said. 
Two days earlier, federal regulators had placed a cap on what Calpine and 
other energy producers could charge for energy -- a cap Maviglio had touted 
on behalf of Davis. 
Monday's disclosure of Maviglio's transaction comes just days after Davis 
fired five consultants who were purchasing energy for the state from a 
company whose stock they owned. At the time, Maviglio said it "appeared to us 
there was a possible violation of the law, or very close to it." 
He said his own situation was different, "because they (the five) were 
committing state resources and timing their purchases." The disclosure of his 
transaction, he said, was "clearly a political smear by a desperate 
candidate," referring to Secretary of State Bill Jones, a Republican 
gubernatorial hopeful and rival of Davis. 
Jones said Maviglio "should be fired immediately" and that Davis should order 
all of his staff to immediately file updated conflict-of-interest statements 
to reflect current holdings. 
Maviglio said he would sell the Calpine stock - which closed at $37.13 a 
share Monday - if requested by Davis' legal staff. He said he spoke with 
those lawyers Monday and they had not made that request, nor had he been 
asked to resign. 
A Davis aide, Hilary McLean, said, "Absolutely, the governor has confidence 
in Steve."







Aide denies stock deal was improper 
Maviglio says the June 20 purchase, submitted online, was in the hands of 
others. 
July 31, 2001 
By JOHN HOWARD
The Orange County Register 
SACRAMENTO The governor's chief spokesman denies he committed any impropriety 
by buying Calpine Corp. stock June 20, saying the purchase was actually in 
the hands of others. 
Steven Maviglio said he submitted on May 31 a purchase order through his 
online brokerage to buy 300 shares of Calpine, a San Jose-based power 
generator that has a long-term energy contract with the state. 
"It could have happened an hour after later (after the purchase order), a 
month later or five years later," he said. "Or never." 
But Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a political scientist at Clare mont Graduate 
University, questioned the wisdom of Maviglio's stock transaction. 
"What I find puzzling is that he moved to change the dynamic of his stock in 
the middle of this energy problem, in the middle of the governor's attacks 
and the governor's negotiations," she said. "There ought to have been an 
understanding that even if not illegal, there should have been a perception 
that he shouldn't be involved in playing with stocks." 
The disclosure of the transaction couldn't have come at a worse time for the 
administration, or Maviglio: On Friday, five state energy consultants with 
stock-firm stock were summarily fired and a state lawyer was reassigned to 
another job. Another consultant with similar investments quit July 14 to take 
a private job. 
All were involved in the energy-purchasing program that was launched under an 
emergency order Jan. 17, in which the state began buying power on behalf of 
the strapped utilities, which did not credit to purchase power on their own. 
Dozens of people were directly involved in the energy purchases. 
Earlier in the day Monday, in a separate issue, the governor's office 
disclosed that two key consultants who had been hired to help Davis with his 
public relations had decided to forgo $50,000 in contract fees as part of a 
legal settlement with Davis' critics. 
The two consultants, Chris Lehane and Mark Fabiani, both veterans of the 
Clinton-Gore White House and political campaigns, had been hired in May under 
a $30,000-a month state contract. 
Republicans complained that Davis was using state money to finance political 
operatives. Fabiani left the payroll earlier under pressure; Lehane left this 
month.







Power firms amp up lobbying 
Politics: Edison spends $5.5 million to gain support for bailout to prevent 
bankruptcy. 
July 31, 2001 
By KIMBERLY KINDY
and HANH KIM QUACH
The Orange County Register 
SACRAMENTO Edison International has spent more than $5.5 million this year to 
enlist residents and stockholders to lobby the Legislature to bail out its 
subsidiary Southern California Edison and save it from bankruptcy, reports 
released Monday show. 
The latest financial disclosure statements show that energy companies 
continue to spend millions of dollars to influence the Legislature. Meals, 
campaign contributions and tickets to sporting events continue to flow to 
lawmakers and their staffs. 
Overall, the amount spent on direct lobbying of the Legislature rose slightly 
over last quarter, but gifts and contributions to candidates continued to 
fall. The deadline for statements is today, but many companies and candidates 
filed early. 
Edison's $5.5 million is so far the largest expenditure directed toward an 
orchestrated campaign to influence Capitol politicians. Spokesman Brian 
Bennett said Edison spent the money on television commercials to reach all 
Californians and on a telephone appeal directly to stockholders. 
"This was to educate the public about the dangers of bankruptcy to the 
state's economy and to solicit their support in conveying a message to the 
Legislature that bankruptcy is not an option for the Edison company," Bennett 
said. 
The telephone work involved telling stockholders that the company's value 
would drop if lawmakers did not support a bill to save Edison. Then they 
offered to directly connect the stockholders to lawmakers' offices, asking 
that they tell the lawmakers directly to support the bailout. 
Consumer advocate Doug Heller said Edison's spending - which totaled $5.7 
million for the three-month reporting period and jumped from $318,802 from 
the prior quarter - is out of line. 
"It's amazing that a company teetering on the edge of bankruptcy has millions 
of dollars to throw around to politicians and to create phony grass-roots 
campaigns to influence legislators," said Heller, of the Foundation for 
Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. 
Edison said no contributions were made directly to anyone running for office 
or re-election for this quarter. 
In all, lawmakers sitting on energy committees and who had reported by Monday 
night accepted nearly $61,000 from energy-related companies. 
As of late Monday, Assemblyman Dean Florez, D-Shafter, who sits on the 
Assembly Energy Committee, had received the largest contribution from energy 
companies this quarter, $21,000. 
Seven of the largest power producers that sell electricity to the state spent 
a total of $546,488 on lobbying and other efforts to influence the 
Legislature. 
Topping the list was Calpine Corp., which spent $141,204. Duke Energy came in 
second at $99,735.44 - a $20,000 leap over the prior quarter. Most of Duke's 
money was spent on consultants who worked overtime building a defense for the 
company against accusations of price gouging made by former employees. 
"Overall, our consultants spent more time setting the record straight against 
some blatantly false and misleading statements, regarding our rates and plant 
operations, which the state's own documents proved were false," said Duke 
spokesman Pat Mullen. Some lawmakers and energy experts say the state 
documents do not clear Duke of wrongdoing, and the accusations are still 
being investigated by a Senate committee.






Gouger Gray Davis 
California's petulant governor ignores reality as he overpays for electricity

LANCE T. IZUMI Mr. Izumi is a senior fellow in California Studies at the San 
Francisco- based Pacific Research Institute.
On the surface, things seem to be going pretty good for Gov. Gray Davis with 
regard to California's electricity crisis. The governor has scored some nice 
publicity by switching on some new power plants. The weather has been 
unseasonably cool. His poll numbers are edging back up. Yet beneath this 
optimistic picture lie troubling problems. For example, Davis's argument that 
out-of-state power generators are responsible for the electricity crisis has 
been falling apart. For months, Davis has been claiming that private 
generators have overcharged California by $8.9 billion and demanded that this 
amount be refunded to the state. However, after a two-week mediation between 
state officials and the generators, Curtis Wagner, the federal government's 
chief energy regulatory judge, rebuked Davis's claim saying that such a huge 
overcharge "has not and cannot be substantiated." Further, while the 
generators may be liable to refund a much smaller amount to the state, 
perhaps $1 billion, Wagner said that generators are owed more money by the 
state than they owe the state in refunds: "Can a cash refund be required 
where a much larger amount is due the seller? The chief judge thinks not." 
Davis reacted to the judge's ruling by calling it a "raw deal" and by urging 
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to ignore the lack of evidence and 
the judge's conclusions and to "step up and provide the refunds we've asked 
for." Davis's position, as usual, is motivated purely by politics. Indeed, 
Dan Walters of the Sacramento Bee says that Davis is operating in a 
"melodramatic virtual world" de-linked from reality. 
Davis's blame-the-generators argument took another body blow when newly 
released documents showed that, on average, major out-of-state power 
companies such as Enron, Duke, Dynergy and Mirant charged less than the 
average prices paid by the state during the first three months of the year. 
California government utilities, on the other hand, such as the Los Angeles 
Department of Water and Power and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District 
(SMUD), charged the state much more for electricity than the out-of-state 
generators. For example, while Texas-based Enron, a favorite Davis whipping 
boy, charged an average $181 per megawatt hour, SMUD charged an average $330 
per megawatt hour. 
Davis responded to this revelation in typical political fashion. A Davis 
spokesman said that the governor had expressed his anger at "the generators 
who wear cowboy hats" and that "just because there are other entities that 
are charging us more doesn't change the fact that we are getting ripped off 
by companies from Houston, Tulsa, Atlanta or Charlotte." 
Yet, for all Davis' feigned indignation about consumers being ripped off, it 
turns out that he and his regulators are poised to ensure that business 
consumers are ripped off by state government. Davis has signed $43 billion in 
ill-advised long-term purchase contracts at rates above-market-price. The 
state must, therefore, ensure that enough business customers remain in the 
current state-controlled distribution system to pay for high-priced state 
power purchases. This is especially important to Davis since the high prices 
are borne disproportionately by business. Thus, Davis' regulators are set to 
eliminate "direct access," which allows businesses to shop for cheaper power. 
Who's the real gouger? No matter how much Davis points the finger, 
Californians are paying dearly for his political opportunism and bad 
policies. 







Turning Coal into a tradable commodity
By Rick Stouffer
rstouffer@ftenergy.com <mailto:rstouffer@ftenergy.com>
With the California power debacle offering a neck-snapping jolt, a number of 
states have determined they must offer more than lip service to ensure that 
residents and businesses have enough power to function.

While deregulation's brakes may have been applied in some locales, it doesn't 
mean that development incentives likewise have been scaled back. 

"There is no question that California was the wake-up call for these states," 
said Craig Goodman, president of the National Energy Marketers Association. 

Midwest a hotbed for incentives
Many of the states that have already passed legislation to entice new plant 
development are located in the Midwest, an area that, while not yet suffering 
from a lack of power, slowly, inexorably is heading in that direction. 

"Iowa, Illinois and Ohio are located in ECAR (the East Central Area of the 
North American Electric Reliability Council, or NERC), which is not yet in a 
crisis situation when it comes to sufficient power, but is only a year or two 
away from that crisis," said Robert Burns, senior research associate with the 
National Regulatory Research Institute at Ohio State University in Columbus, 
Ohio. 

In its latest self-assessment presented as part of NERC's most recent 10-year 
projection, 2000-2009, ECAR said that if 10,400 MW of new capacity is not 
added within ECAR as planned, capacity margins within the region will go 
negative in 2005. 

PPAs a no-no in Iowa
No plant of any significant size has been built in Iowa since 1983, but 
legislators, during a one-day special session in June, put in place what they 
hope will spur additional development. 

The Iowa measure allows utilities to see how their costs will be incorporated 
into rates prior to plant investment, and also permits municipal systems to 
band together to finance new facilities. 

One item the Iowa legislature could not get past a veto that Gov. Tom Vilsack 
promised was allowing utilities to purchase power via power purchase 
contracts from unregulated affiliates. 

The governor said such a measure would lock in profits for utilities and 
preclude potential rate cuts. Proponents say the governor effectively locked 
out millions of dollars of investment in Iowa by Madison, Wis.-based Alliant 
Energy Corp., which reportedly wanted to build as much as 1,200 MW of 
capacity in Iowa. 

Wisconsin Energy likes the tune
Northeast of Iowa, Wisconsin appears to be heading off a problem nearly all 
power plant developers have these days: a bad case of "not in my backyard." 

"Even if a state approves a new power supply, you still have to deal with 
local siting officials and NIMBYism," said Goodman. 

One Wisconsin proposal given serious consideration is to double the impact 
plants have on shared revenue payments, to $250 million from $125 million. 

Changing shared revenue payments to provide additional compensation to local 
governments that favor plant construction on existing plant sites also has 
been introduced in Wisconsin. 

Wisconsin Gov. Scott McCallum also has proposed lowering the state's gross 
receipts tax on wholesale power to 1.59% from the current 3.19%.

Many of the proposals floating around the Badger State are music to the ears 
of Wisconsin Energy, which is looking to spend some $7 billion over the next 
decade to construct five new power plants. 

Not everyone likes the look of incentive legislation in Iowa, Wisconsin and 
other states. Many of the new laws are geared toward assisting incumbent 
utilities*effectively snubbing independent power producers, the IPPs say. 

"I would not call many of these incentive packages incentives for merchant 
power producers," said Samantha Slater, manager of state and regional affairs 
for the Electric Power Supply Association. "Utilities only building new 
plants definitely is not the way to go." 

Big doings in Illinois
Perhaps the biggest, most all-encompassing incentive package passed by a 
state in recent memory isn't specifically about promoting plant development. 

Illinois Gov. George H. Ryan in late June signed legislation that provides up 
to $3.5 billion in incentives designed, industry watchers say, to preserve 
and promote the state's $1 billion coal industry*and keep 25,000 coal-related 
jobs intact.

"Illinois in part wanted to protects its coal jobs with this legislation," 
said Paul Cetevich, director of energy services at the Utility Research 
Center at the University of Florida's Warrington College of Business in 
Gainesville. "Illinois has been trying to do similar things for a number of 
years." 

The Illinois plan includes sales (6.5%) and utility tax exemptions, along 
with an investment tax credit, millions for a financial assistance program 
for coal-fired facilities, bond funds set aside to be used for transmission 
upgrades and to finance renewable energy projects, even a review by the state 
Environmental Protection Agency to determine if new regulations concerning 
older coal-fired plant emissions are warranted.

Highlights of Illinois energy incentive legislation  Designates new baseload 
plants, the mines that fuel them or firms that construct new or upgrade 
existing transmission lines as so-called high-impact businesses. These 
businesses are provided sales tax exemptions on building materials and 
equipment, utility tax exemptions and investment tax credits. (Natural 
gas-fired plants are only eligible for sales tax exemption.)  Creates a $500 
million financial assistance program for coal-fired plants equal to the 
amount of general obligation bond funding that can be repaid by coal tax 
revenues gained on new Illinois coal purchases.  Provides up to $1.7 billion 
in revenue bond authorization to provide financing for electric plants 
generating Illinois coal mining jobs, including mine-mouth plants and plants 
that use clean-coal technology, repayable by the developers.  Provides up to 
$300 million in revenue bond authorization designed to spur upgrades to the 
transmission grid in Illinois, repayable by the wires' owner.  Provides up to 
$500 million in revenue bond authorization to finance renewable energy 
projects, and $500 million for existing coal-fired plants to add scrubbers, 
both repayable by the developers.  Mandates a review by the Illinois 
Environmental Protection Agency of the need for new state regulations 
governing emissions by older coal-fired plants not subject to stricter air 
quality restrictions imposed on new units.  Creation of additional local 
options for property tax abatement.  In addition, Illinois Gov. George H. 
Ryan amended an earlier executive order creating the Governor's Energy 
Cabinet. Under the revised order, the Energy Cabinet will have responsibility 
for siting new generation, overseeing implementation of environmental 
regulations on new plant developers and streamlining the state's permitting 
process for new generation. 

"When the legislative session began in January, you had all the publicity 
about California, the price of natural gas had spiked, there was talk of $3 a 
gallon gasoline, so there were probably three or four versions of coal 
legislation floating around at one time," said Brian Reardon, a spokesman for 
the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs. 

Ryan convened a coal summit in March, took ideas from all invited and put 
together what became the state's $3.5 billion incentive package. 

"I'm very impressed with what Illinois has put in place," the energy 
marketers' Goodman said. "I'm not aware of any other state with as 
comprehensive a package." 

A newly created Governor's Energy Cabinet in Illinois would seem to put 
NIMBYism to bed, if not totally to rest, by assuming responsibility for 
siting new generation, overseeing environmental regulation implementation and 
streamlining state permitting. 

"We were able to develop a comprehensive strategy that addresses our state's 
energy needs while providing for a long overdue boost to our coal industry," 
Gov. Ryan said in a statement. 

Looking at the broader picture
Illinois is preserving the coal industry, but also looking at the broader 
picture, according to the University of Florida's Cetevich. Illinois, and 
many other states, have determined that natural gas-fired plants may not be 
the saviors the country should rely upon. 

"I believe the No. 1 overriding factor, while some states are putting 
incentive packages together, is that the states and public utility 
commissions have realized that with the numerous natural gas price spikes, 
coal is not such a bad option after all." 

"Having all our eggs in the natural gas basket could be a bad thing," agreed 
the National Regulatory Research Institute's Burns. "It cannot have good 
implications." 







Debt Pitch:
California's Next Test
In Electricity Crisis:
Selling Power Bonds
---
The $12.5 Billion Offering,
Crucial to State Finances,
Faces Skeptical Investors
---
The Risk of Big Budget Cuts 
By Mitchel Benson and Gregory Zuckerman 

07/31/2001 
The Wall Street Journal 
Page A1 
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- For the past seven months, Gov. Gray Davis has begged, 
cajoled and even threatened legislators and regulators, to lay the groundwork 
for a $12.5 billion bond issue California needs to cover the cost of keeping 
its lights on. 
Now comes the tough part: persuading investors that the bond is an attractive 
investment. On that score, Mr. Davis's team, whose credibility has been 
battered by California's months-long electricity crisis, is hoping to bounce 
back from a rocky start. 
This week, a delegation headed by state Treasurer Philip Angelides is 
scheduled to visit Wall Street to pitch the municipal debt offering, which 
would be the largest in U.S. history by a factor of nearly four. To succeed, 
Mr. Angelides will have to allay investors' fears of the kind of political 
infighting that already has delayed the issue several times. He will have to 
satisfy bond-rating agencies that the bond is safe enough to merit a top-tier 
investment-grade rating. And he'll have to make investors want to buy it 
without demanding costly inducements that would give California financial 
headaches for decades to come. 
"This isn't building the Panama Canal. It's not Apollo 11," says Mr. 
Angelides. But, he concedes, the bond sale will be "uniquely challenging." 
That is because this giant bond issue won't be backed by the full faith and 
credit of the state or by tax dollars -- the types of guarantees public-debt 
investors often prefer. Instead, the bonds, which will have maturities of as 
long as 15 years, are to be paid off by the state's electricity ratepayers 
from their monthly bills, which some view as a riskier source of cash flow. 
Moreover, there is still a question as to whether the issue's proceeds will 
be adequate to repay the bonds, restore the state's financially troubled 
private utilities to health and finance future electricity purchases. 
Despite these hurdles, many analysts predict California will eventually 
succeed in pulling off the bond deal, though at a cost far higher than 
originally anticipated. In fact, the apparent easing of the state's energy 
crunch may make its marketing job a bit less difficult. A recent drop in the 
price of natural gas, which fuels many California power plants, a mild summer 
in the West and a June decision by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
to impose electricity price caps in the region have helped avert the rolling 
blackouts that roiled the state earlier this year. 
Still, the specter of history overhangs the bond offering. Rating agencies 
are haunted by having failed to warn investors of such public-finance 
disasters as the 1983 default of the Washington Public Power Supply System 
and the 1994 bankruptcy of Orange County, Calif. Moreover, Moody's Investors 
Service and Standard & Poor's assigned investment-grade ratings as recently 
as early January to debt issued by Pacific Gas & Electric Co., just three 
months before the California utility sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy-court 
protection. 
By the time California hopes to sell its bonds, in October or early November, 
the state's electrical-power purchases are expected to leave it owing a total 
of about $10 billion to its lenders and its own general fund. If the bond 
issue is delayed beyond that, or canceled, or if the offering flops, 
California could be forced to make billions of dollars in spending cuts, 
raise taxes or increase electricity rates for the third time in the past year 
to pay back what it owes. 
If the bond sale fails "the state of California will be in deep trouble," 
says Mr. Angelides. "The state general fund must be repaid so money for 
education, health care and children's services can be safe." 
California's need for the bonds -- like most of the state's energy woes -- 
stems from its troubled 1996 electricity-deregulation plan. Under the plan, 
the state's investor-owned utilities were obliged to sell many of their power 
plants to other companies and purchase electricity through a state-sponsored 
power auction. Consumer rates were frozen, but wholesale rates weren't. 
The system worked fairly well until May 2000, when wholesale rates began 
soaring amid tight electricity supplies and stronger-than-expected demand. 
Last year, the state's cost of wholesale power climbed to $27 billion from $7 
billion in 1999. In the first six months of this year, that sum hit $20 
billion. 
With retail rates frozen, Pacific Gas & Electric, a unit of PG&E Corp., and 
Edison International's Southern California Edison racked up billions of 
dollars of debts. In January, after power generators stopped doing business 
with the utilities, the state began buying power on their behalf. It borrowed 
the money from its general fund, normally used to pay for everything from 
public safety and environmental programs to social services and education, at 
a pace of more than $1 billion a month. 
In February, Mr. Davis's allies in the state Legislature helped him pass a 
bill authorizing the state to sell bonds to replenish the fund and to 
continue making power purchases. But legislators cautiously capped the size 
of the borrowing, using a complex formula. Under the new law, the formula 
would allow only for a bond sale of less than $1 billion. 
Realizing that wasn't sufficient, the governor and the assembly drafted 
another bill that scrapped the formula and allowed the state to sell up to 
$13.4 billion of bonds. But, in a setback for Mr. Davis, Republican lawmakers 
banded together to deny him the two-thirds majority needed for the bill to 
immediately become law. As a result, the law won't take effect until 
mid-August, when the public-finance market is all but moribund. 
In the meantime, Mr. Angelides moved to hire underwriters. After receiving 
four dozen bids from Wall Street investment bankers in February, he retained 
a team led by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. But under pressure to get the financing 
moving, the treasurer didn't negotiate firm underwriting fees on the deal. 
At the time, Mr. Angelides said he expected the underwriters to "skinny down" 
their fees given the enormous size of the offering. But Morgan, representing 
a team of underwriters that includes Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., Citgroup 
Inc.'s Salomon Smith Barney unit and Bear, Stearns & Co., says it expects to 
charge standard fees, given the significant challenges presented by the 
issue's size. In the case of a $12.5 billion sale, that amounts to around $56 
million. J.P. Morgan and the California treasurer's office now say the fees 
won't be decided until they determine the bond issue's final size and 
structure. 
From the start, relations between California officials and Wall Street seemed 
fraught with miscommunication. In February, Mr. Davis called a meeting to 
explain to institutional investors, analysts and rating-agency executives his 
blueprint for getting a grip on California's energy crisis. The session, his 
only face-to-face meeting with investors to date, was held at Manhattan's 
Cornell Club. Attendees say the governor kept them waiting for 20 minutes 
before breezing into the room and giving them only a general overview of the 
state's energy plan, which left investors grumbling. 
During the discussion, Mr. Davis, a Bronx, N.Y., native, made light of a 
conversation he had had with Richard Cortright Jr., a Standard & Poor's 
director. "I told him: `You're from Indiana, that explains why you're not 
getting it,'" the governor said, according to several people present. 
"It was intended as a joke, but no one was laughing," says A.J. Sabatelle, a 
Moody's vice president. A spokesman for Mr. Davis says the governor doesn't 
recall the exchange; Mr. Davis is frequently late for public engagements. A 
spokesman for Mr. Cortright wouldn't comment. 
Then, in March, the governor's office set up a conference call to update 
investors. Figuring they wouldn't get a big turnout, they used an open-mike 
system that allowed each investor's comments to be heard by everyone else. 
But with around 100 investors taking part, the presentation by Joseph 
Fichera, a paid consultant who is one of Mr. Davis's top financial advisers, 
turned into a free-for-all, with one caller cursing Mr. Fichera in response 
to one of his answers. 
Infighting among California politicians hasn't helped. Earlier this year, for 
example, state Controller Kathleen Connell criticized the way her fellow 
Democrats, Messrs. Davis and Angelides, were handling the bond sale. Unless 
it was far bigger, she warned, the state would face a "cash-flow crunch" by 
February or March of 2002. The governor's office fired back, calling her 
claims "completely" political. 
California policy makers have "spent most of the year bickering and finger 
pointing," Standard & Poor's director Peter Rigby said in a recent report, 
"and that will raise some uncertainty among lenders." Moreover, investors 
know the state needs the money, and so "it's a buyer's market," Mr. Rigby 
added. 
Aware that it needed a financial pro to make its case to Wall Street, the 
Davis Administration pushed Mr. Fichera to the forefront. Since May, the 
former Prudential Securities investment banker has spent hours on conference 
calls with Wall Street explaining the state's strategy. That and a sense that 
California has gotten a better grip on its electricity woes indicates that 
"the governor's staff is far higher on the learning curve than just a few 
months ago," says Paul Patterson, an electric-power analyst at ABN Amro Inc. 
Critical barriers remain. The state's Public Utilities Commission has yet to 
make key decisions intended to ensure that there's enough ratepayer revenue 
set aside to guarantee that bondholders get paid. On Aug. 23, for example, 
the PUC is expected to take up a rate agreement giving the state's power 
purchaser, the Department of Water Resources, unprecedented authority to 
raise rates without a public hearing. The commission also is expected to 
decide how to divvy up current ratepayer revenue among state and private 
utilities and to take up a measure that would prohibit large industrial 
consumers from, in effect, bypassing the utilities and buying their juice 
directly from generators or traders. 
But opponents of those controversial measures are expected to put up a fight. 
Businesses and consumer groups are particularly upset that the state might 
get carte blanche to raise rates and are threatening to sue to block the PUC 
decision before the state Supreme Court. 
California already has some of the highest electricity rates in the nation. 
Residential consumers in San Francisco, for instance, pay around 14 cents per 
kilowatt hour for power, up from about 10 cents in December. That compares 
with around seven cents per kilowatt hour in Atlanta and 10 cents in Chicago, 
but it is still lower than the nearly 23 cents charged in New York City. 
High costs are a big reason businesses think they ought to be free to buy 
electricity directly. It's not "in the best interest of consumers to 
eliminate direct access in order to market bonds that will keep the price of 
electricity in California higher than necessary for at least 10 years," says 
Allan Zaremberg, president of the California Chamber of Commerce. 
The state's three largest investor-owned utilities, PG&E, SoCalEd and Sempra 
Energy's San Diego Gas & Electric Co., are expected to demand the largest 
possible share of the revenues they collect from ratepayers. PG&E, for 
example, has already asked for a public hearing to examine the state's claim 
that it needs so much money. The pressure to allocate more cash to the 
utilities could also rise if a state-sponsored bailout plan for SoCalEd fails 
and the utility joins PG&E in bankruptcy proceedings. 
Sorting all these issues out before the PUC may lead to legal challenges that 
could delay the bond issuance for months. And potential investors face 
another nagging concern: Under a $43 billion series of long-term power 
contracts signed by the state, electricity generators and traders involved 
get first call on revenue from ratepayers. Only then would bondholders, who 
are accustomed to being first in line, get paid. 
In fact, some investors who were initially enthusiastic about a bond that is 
expected to pay more than half a percentage point above other municipal 
issues in the market are starting to have doubts. Marilyn Cohen, president of 
Envision Capital in Los Angeles, a firm that manages bond portfolios for 
individual investors, says she spent several months setting aside money to 
participate in the deal. Now, she says, she is starting to look elsewhere. "I 
don't have confidence that it will get done," she adds. 
Many investors are concerned the state hasn't proved it can overcome its 
energy crisis. "These are the same guys who told us energy prices were going 
south five years ago, they're trying to gloss over the potential problems," 
says Kelly Mainelli, a portfolio manager at Montgomery Asset Management in 
San Francisco, who is considering investing in the bonds. He says he also 
worries about a spike in natural gas prices ahead of the offering. 
To reassure potential investors, the state now is offering to amass a $3 
billion reserve -- from bond proceeds and ratepayer revenues -- to ensure 
that bondholders would get paid in the event of any unforeseen developments 
in the power market. In addition, California lawmakers are moving a bill 
through the Legislature that would set aside a specific portion of revenues 
from ratepayers solely to pay bondholders. Such an approach could help the 
bond issue "to get a higher rating," says David Hitchcock, director of 
Standard & Poor's state and local government group. 
It might not, however. It isn't clear whether bankruptcy courts can overrule 
state government. So, some investors worry that PG&E's bankruptcy judge could 
rule that money collected by the utility should go to the company's 
creditors, and not to paying investors in the coming bond deal, throwing a 
wrench into the offering. The same would be true in the case of SoCalEd if it 
ended up filing for Chapter 11 protection. 
Underwriters are moving to broaden the appeal of the planned issue by 
chopping it into small slices aimed at different types of investors. There 
will be taxable, tax-free, variable-interest, fixed-interest, short-term and 
long-term bonds. State Finance Director Tim Gage says the state is assuming a 
rating "in the range of single-A" on the power bonds and thus expects to pay 
an average annual interest rate of 5.77% on the tax-exempt issue and 7.77% on 
the taxable bonds. 
Investors and analysts "may think we're crazy," says Guy Phillips, one of the 
state's top legislative aides on energy matters, "But in the end, the 
decision for them is: `Do we see a path to get our money.'"

California ; Op Ed Desk 
Commentary The State Will Pay for Davis' Panic
KATHLEEN CONNELL; PETER NAVARRO

07/31/2001 
Los Angeles Times 
Home Edition

The five-to-20-year power contracts signed in a panic by the Davis 
administration have saddled California with billions of dollars of "stranded 
costs" that will burden our economy and state budget for years to come. 
Now, Gov. Gray Davis' spin doctors want us to believe that these $43-billion 
long-term contracts were both necessary and the impetus for a moderating 
energy market. Here's the real story: 
Last summer, under a flawed deregulation, a handful of large out-of-state 
generators effectively cornered California 's wholesale electricity market. 
This "sellers cartel" first drained our electric utilities dry. In November, 
it became the taxpayers' turn to be victimized, when the Davis administration 
gave carte blanche authority to the Department of Water Resources for energy 
purchases. Between November and July, the department burned through $8 
billion in short-term energy purchases, devouring almost the entire state 
budget surplus. This required the state Public Utilities Commission to pass 
the largest rate hike in California history and will require the state to 
issue $12.4 billion in bonds this fall to service this debt. 
In February, with spot market prices at all-time highs and rolling blackouts 
rippling through the state, the governor's representatives began to negotiate 
long-term contracts with the sellers cartel. This was an ill-advised 
long-term strategy to fight a short-run crisis. To understand why, look at 
the negotiating chessboard from the electricity cartel's perspective. The 
cartel's negotiators knew that within 18 to 24 months, there would be a huge 
glut of power on the market as many power plants were already under 
construction in California and throughout the West. Once the new energy 
resources were available, the cartel would no longer be able to manipulate 
the market. This supply glut would drive prices back to the 1999 range of 
three to five cents per kilowatt-hour, far lower than the prices now set in 
the long-term energy contracts. 
To the cartel members, this looming power glut was a recipe for heavy losses. 
Locking the state into long-term contracts at lucrative rates was their 
redemption. The Davis administration walked into this market inferno, 
bargaining from extreme weakness at the top of the market, signing contracts 
that were too expensive. The administration also capitulated on two highly 
objectionable clauses. The first requires the state to absorb all costs of 
environmental protection for many of the generators. The second holds the 
generators "harmless" for any increase in taxes imposed on the generators by 
the state. This provision essentially freezes taxes on the generators over 
the next several years, requiring taxpayers to pick up the tab. 
Notwithstanding the administration's spin, the current improvement in our 
energy situation may be traced to at least four other factors: This summer 
has been unusually cool, Californians have increased their conservation, 
recessionary forces have reduced demand and, most important, the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission finally imposed price caps on the sellers 
cartel, dampening market manipulation. 
The bottom line is this: Long after the rolling blackouts stop, California 
still will be saddled with billions of dollars of unnecessary electricity 
costs and high bond debt. These higher costs will hurt consumers and 
businesses, put heavy pressure on the state budget for years and inhibit the 
state's economic growth. 
There are two lessons from this multibillion-dollar mistake. The first is to 
have full public review of major energy decisions. Equally important, the 
Public Utilities Commission must be allowed to retain its rate-making 
authority so that problems are not hidden in a state bureaucracy.





Electrical Switch: Now, Cheaper Power
Is Causing Hefty Losses for California 
By Rebecca Smith

Mild weather means that California is escaping blackouts, but it also means 
that the state is amassing power-trading losses that are adding to the cost 
of an energy mess now in its 15th month. 
Internal documents show that so far in July, California has resold the 
equivalent of 8% of the power it bought under short-term and long-term 
contracts that were designed to reduce the state's reliance on the volatile 
and costly spot market. The problem is, the state has had a surfeit of power, 
and it has been selling the juice into the market at a fraction of the price 
it paid, leading to losses from July 1 through Thursday of about $30 million 
to $35 million. 
The losses illustrate the difficulties dogging the state's new energy czar, 
the California Department of Water Resources, despite a softening of 
electricity prices and demand. The department got into the power-purchasing 
business in a big way in January, when the state's biggest investor-owned 
utilities quit buying power because they were no longer creditworthy. Since 
then, the state has signed $43 billion worth of contracts, one for as much as 
20 years, in a bid to tamp down high spot-market prices. Critics now say it 
was a mistake to lock in so much power at such a high cost. 
Power officials say the state has been in the odd position since last month 
of having too much power contracted for off-peak hours. "It's something you'd 
expect when you first get into a new business and you'd hope to reduce it," 
said Pete Garris, chief of operations for the power-purchasing agency. 
Internal numbers from the DWR, which the agency has confirmed, show that on 
average the state paid, from July 1 to Thursday, $123 per megawatt hour for 
some 1.8 million megawatts of power purchased under long-term contracts, and 
$148 per megawatt hour for some 2.2 million megawatt hours of power purchased 
under short-term contracts. In the same period, the records show it sold 
excess power amounting to 320,000 megawatt hours at an average price of $27 
per megawatt hour, less than what it costs to fuel many plants. At times, the 
DWR sold the juice for as little as $2 per megawatt hour. 
This, ironically, has offered an opportunity to power traders that the state 
was seeking to hem in through its contract program. They have been able at 
times to substitute cheap power they buy from the state for the more costly 
power they otherwise would have to generate to meet their contract 
obligations. 
Despite the agency's power-trading losses, total market costs still are down 
substantially from previous months, partly due to price limits set June 19 by 
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Slacker demand also has been a 
factor. In June, Southern California Edison, a unit of Edison International, 
sold 11.8% less electricity to its customers than in June 2000, reflecting 
energy conservation and reduced demand for air conditioning. 
Since January the state has spent $9.5 billion buying power at an average 
cost of $237 per megawatt hour, according to internal DWR documents. That is 
more than double the price of wholesale electricity last year, when prices 
averaged $114. The state's cash-strapped utilities have reimbursed the agency 
$1.53 billion of the $9.5 billion it has spent so far. As a result of the 
huge shortfall, the state has tapped California 's general fund and now is 
pursuing a plan to sell $12.5 billion worth of revenue bonds to replenish its 
coffers. 
The state signed dozens of long-term power contracts after January, pushed by 
federal energy regulators to protect itself against spot-market volatility. 
So far this year, it has spent $851 million under long-term contracts, $2.36 
billion under short-term arrangements and $5.54 billion on spot-market 
purchases, according to the DWR documents. 
But the state's "long" position in July, in which it had too much power, has 
at times given power-trading companies an arbitrage opportunity. Last 
Wednesday, for example, the state sold electricity for as little as $2 per 
megawatt hour on the same day that it was paying $22 to $75 on the spot 
market, presumably because its advance purchases did not exactly match the 
actual shape of demand. 
John Stout, senior vice president for Houston-based Reliant Energy Inc., a 
big energy supplier to California , said a trader can double or triple his 
company's profit by substituting cheap market power from the water-resources 
agency for power the company otherwise would generate. It is also free to 
resell the natural gas it might have used to fuel its plants. "That's what 
the trader is there to do and not leave money on the table," said Mr. Stout.

Publicized Letter to Lay Involved Struggle Over Enron's Direction
By John R. Emshwiller and Kathryn Kranhold
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

A now highly publicized August 2001 letter from an Enron Corp. executive raising serious questions about the company's business and accounting practices was actually one of the later shots fired in an internal struggle that had been going on inside the energy-trading company for a year or more. 
The letter to Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay from Sherron Watkins, a company vice president, detailed what she saw as the huge financial and public-relations risks facing the company. Extensive dealings with partnerships that had been set up and run by some of the company's own executives could cause Enron to "implode," she wrote. Widespread disclosure of those partnerships in the media beginning in October played a key role in a collapse in investor confidence that eventually forced Enron to seek bankruptcy-law protection.
Ms. Watkins's attorney, Philip Hilder, declined to discuss details of the letter. But he said his client likely would cooperate with some of the government investigations into the Enron collapse. "She has a compelling story and I expect she'll have an opportunity to tell that story," Mr. Hilder said. 
But the story behind Ms. Watkins's letter is much more than that. It involves a power struggle over the direction of Enron as it committed itself to the extremely unusual and tangled partnership structures that eventually contributed to its undoing. People familiar with that struggle say the issues ranged from the ethics of Enron's actions to a battle for the job of chief financial officer at the Houston-based energy-trading company. The partnerships -- called LJM Cayman LP and LJM2 Co-Investment LP -- were formed in 1999 by then Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, who also ran the entities and owned part of them. From the beginning, Mr. Fastow, Mr. Lay and other top company officials said the LJM partnerships were designed to do business deals with Enron and help the energy company manage its financial risk. 
However, other Enron officials were extremely skeptical about the partnerships, say company insiders and others familiar with the matter. For one thing, they saw inherent conflicts of interest in having the company's chief financial officer standing to financially benefit from business deals done with Enron by an outside partnership that he headed. Late last year, Enron estimated that Mr. Fastow made more than $30 million from the LJM partnerships. 
One of the chief critics was Jeffrey McMahon, who in March 2000 took his concerns about LJM to then Enron President Jeffrey Skilling. Mr. Skilling didn't share those concerns and soon after the meeting Mr. McMahon left his job as corporate treasurer for another executive post within Enron. 
A spokeswoman for Mr. Skilling says Mr. McMahon merely voiced worry about whether his own compensation might be affected if he had to negotiate deals on the opposite side of the table from LJM. Mr. McMahon "never raised any broader concerns," she said. 
However, an Enron spokesman speaking on behalf of Mr. McMahon strongly challenged that interpretation of events. "There was a very clear conversation where Mr. McMahon expressed concerns about a range of conflicts" related to the LJM entities, said the spokesman. 
Mr. Fastow had been widely viewed within Enron as a close ally of Mr. Skilling, whose sudden resignation last August raised investor concerns and contributed to the company crisis. For his part, Mr. Fastow believed that Mr. McMahon wanted his job as chief financial officer and that Ms. Watkins was an ally in that effort, said a person familiar with the matter. Mr. McMahon was named chief financial officer last October when Enron replaced Mr. Fastow because of rising controversy surrounding the partnerships. 
The Enron spokesman said Mr. McMahon denies that he was seeking the chief-financial-officer job when he went to see Mr. Skilling. Mr. McMahon knew Ms. Watkins, the spokesman said. Indeed, he added, she initially had written the letter anonymously and first revealed her identity as the author to Mr. McMahon. He urged her to identify herself to Mr. Lay and personally express her concerns to the CEO. She later had a meeting with Mr. Lay. 
Ms. Watkins' attorney, Mr. Hilder, said "We categorically deny that Ms. Watkins was in cahoots with Mr. McMahon regarding trying to oust Mr. Fastow as CFO." He declined to comment on any specific dealings she might have had with Mr. McMahon. 
Also expressing concerns about LJM was former Enron Vice Chairman Cliff Baxter, who left the company last May. In her letter, Ms. Watkins said Mr. Baxter "complained mightily . . . about the inappropriateness of our transactions with LJM." Mr. Baxter couldn't be reached for comment yesterday.

Text of Letter to Enron's Chairman After Departure of Chief Executive

c. 2002 New York Times Company

Following is the text of an unsigned letter written in August to Kenneth L. Lay, the chairman of the Enron Corporation, after Jeffrey K. Skilling resigned unexpectedly as chief executive on Aug. 14. Its author was later identified as Sherron S. Watkins, a vice president for corporate development at Enron. The House Energy and Commerce Committee released excerpts of the letter on Monday and the full letter yesterday: 
Has Enron become a risky place to work? For those of us who didn't get rich over the last few years, can we afford to stay?
Skilling's abrupt departure will raise suspicions of accounting improprieties and valuation issues. Enron has been very aggressive in its accounting -- most notably the Raptor transactions and the Condor vehicle. We do have valuation issues with our international assets and possibly some of our EES MTM positions. 
The spotlight will be on us, the market just can't accept that Skilling is leaving his dream job. I think that the valuation issues can be fixed and reported with other good will write-downs to occur in 2002. How do we fix the Raptor and Condor deals? They unwind in 2002 and 2003, we will have to pony up Enron stock and that won't go unnoticed. 
To the layman on the street, it will look like we recognized funds flow of $800 million from merchant asset sales in 1999 by selling to a vehicle (Condor) that we capitalized with a promise of Enron stock in later years. Is that really funds flow or is it cash from equity issuance? 
We have recognized over $550 million of fair value gains on stocks via our swaps with Raptor. Much of that stock has declined significantly -- Avici by 98 percent from $178 million, to $5 million; the New Power Company by 80 percent from $40 a share, to $6 a share. The value in the swaps won't be there for Raptor, so once again Enron will issue stock to offset these losses. Raptor is an LJM entity. It sure looks to the layman on the street that we are hiding losses in a related company and will compensate that company with Enron stock in the future. 
I am incredibly nervous that we will implode in a wave of accounting scandals. My eight years of Enron work history will be worth nothing on my resume, the business world will consider the past successes as nothing but an elaborate accounting hoax. Skilling is resigning now for ''personal reasons'' but I would think he wasn't having fun, looked down the road and knew this stuff was unfixable and would rather abandon ship now than resign in shame in two years. 
Is there a way our accounting guru's can unwind these deals now? I have thought and thought about a way to do this, but I keep bumping into one big problem -- we booked the Condor and Raptor deals in 1999 and 2000, we enjoyed wonderfully high stock price, many executives sold stock, we then try and reverse or fix the deals in 2001, and it's a bit like robbing the bank in one year and trying to pay it back two years later. Nice try, but investors were hurt, they bought at $70 and $80 a share looking for $120 a share and now they're at $38 or worse. We are under too much scrutiny and there are probably one or two disgruntled ''redeployed'' employees who know enough about the ''funny'' accounting to get us in trouble. 
What do we do? I know this question cannot be addressed in the all-employee meeting, but can you give some assurances that you and Causey will sit down and take a good hard objective look at what is going to happen to Condor and Raptor in 2002 and 2003? 
Summary of Alleged Issues: 
RAPTOR Entity was capitalized with LJM equity. That equity is at risk; however, the investment was completely offset by a cash fee paid to LJM. If the Raptor entities go bankrupt LJM is not affected, there is no commitment to contribute more equity. 
The majority of the capitalization of the Raptor entities is some form of Enron N/P, restricted stock and stock rights. 
Enron entered into several equity derivative transactions with the Raptor entities locking in our values for various equity investments we hold. 
As disclosed in 2000, we recognized $500 million of revenue from the equity derivatives offset by market value changes in the underlying securities. 
This year, with the value of our stock declining, the underlying capitalization of the Raptor entities is declining and credit is pushing for reserves against our MTM positions. 
To avoid such a write-down or reserve in quarter one 2001, we ''enhanced'' the capital structure of the Raptor vehicles, committing more ENE shares. 
My understanding of the third-quarter problem is that we must ''enhance'' the vehicles by $250 million. 
I realize that we have had a lot of smart people looking at this and a lot of accountants including AA & Co. have blessed the accounting treatment. None of that will protect Enron if these transactions are ever disclosed in the bright light of day. (Please review the late 90's problems of Waste Management -- where AA paid $130 million plus in litigation re questionable accounting practices.) 
The overriding basic principle of accounting is that if you explain the ''accounting treatment'' to a man in the street, would you influence his investing decisions? Would he sell or buy the stock based on a thorough understanding of the facts? If so, you best present it correctly and/or change the accounting. 
My concern is that the footnotes don't adequately explain the transactions. If adequately explained, the investor would know that the ''entities'' described in our related party footnote are thinly capitalized, the equity holders have no skin in the game, and all the value in the entities comes from the underlying value of the derivatives (unfortunately in this case, a big loss) AND Enron stock and N/P. Looking at the stock we swapped, I also don't believe any other company would have entered into the equity derivative transactions with us at the same prices or without substantial premiums from Enron. In other words, the $500 million in revenue in 2000 would have been much lower. How much lower? 
Raptor looks to be a big bet if the underlying stocks did well, then no one would be the wiser. If Enron stock did well, the stock issuance to these entities would decline and the transactions would be less noticeable. All has gone against us. The stocks, most notably Hanover, the New Power Company and Avici are underwater to great or lesser degrees. 
I firmly believe that executive management of the company must have a clear and precise knowledge of these transactions and they must have the transactions reviewed by objective experts in the fields of securities law and accounting. I believe Ken Lay deserves the right to judge for himself what he believes the probabilities of discovery to be and the estimated damages to the company from those discoveries and decide one of two courses of action: 
1. The probability of discovery is low enough and the estimated damage too great; therefore we find a way to quietly and quickly reverse, unwind, write down these positions/transactions. 
2. The probability of discovery is too great, the estimated damages to the company too great; therefore, we must quantify, develop damage containment plans and disclose. 
I firmly believe that the probability of discovery significantly increased with Skilling's shocking departure. Too many people are looking for a smoking gun. 
Summary of Raptor Oddities: 
1. The accounting treatment looks questionable. 
a. Enron booked a $500 million gain from equity derivatives from a related party. 
b. That related party is thinly capitalized with no party at risk except Enron. 
c. It appears Enron has supported an income statement gain by a contribution of its own shares. 
One basic question: The related party entity has lost $500 million in its equity derivative transactions with Enron. Who bears that loss? I can't find an equity or debt holder that bears that loss. Find out who will lose this money. Who will pay for this loss at the related party entity? 
If it's Enron, from our shares, then I think we do not have a fact pattern that would look good to the S.E.C. or investors. 
2. The equity derivative transactions do not appear to be at arms length. 
a. Enron hedged New Power, Hanover and Avici with the related party at what now appears to be the peak of the market. New Power and Avici have fallen away significantly since. The related party was unable to lay off this risk. This fact pattern is once again very negative for Enron. 
b. I don't think any other unrelated company would have entered into these transactions at these prices. What else is going on here? What was the compensation to the related party to induce it to enter into such transactions? 
3. There is a veil of secrecy around LJM and Raptor. Employees question our accounting propriety consistently and constantly. This alone is cause for concern. 
a. Jeff McMahon was highly vexed over the inherent conflicts of LJM. He complained mightily to Jeff Skilling and laid out five steps he thought should be taken if he was to remain as treasurer. Three days later, Skilling offered him the C.E.O. spot at Enron Industrial Markets and never addressed the five steps with him. 
b. Cliff Baxter complained mightily to Skilling and all who would listen about the inappropriateness of our transactions with LJM. 
c. I have heard one manager-level employee from the principal investments group say, ''I know it would be devastating to all of us, but I wish we would get caught. We're such a crooked company.'' The principal investments group hedged a large number of their investments with Raptor. These people know and see a lot. Many similar comments are made when you ask about these deals. Employees quote our C.F.O. as saying that he has a handshake deal with Skilling that LJM will never lose money. 
4. Can the general counsel of Enron audit the deal trail and the money trail between Enron and LJM/Raptor and its principals? Can he look at LJM? At Raptor? If the C.F.O. says no, isn't that a problem? 
Condor and Raptor Work: 
1. Postpone decision on filling office of the chair, if the current decision includes C.F.O. and/or C.A.O. 
2. Involve Jim Derrick and Rex Rogers to hire a law firm to investigate the Condor and Raptor transactions to give Enron attorney-client privilege on the work product. (Can't use V & E due to conflict -- they provided some true sale opinions on some of the deals). 
3. Law firm to hire one of the big 6, but not Arthur Andersen or PricewaterhouseCoopers due to their conflicts of interest: AA & Co. (Enron); PWC (LJM). 
4. Investigate the transactions, our accounting treatment and our future commitments to these vehicles in the form of stock, NP, etc., For instance: In the third quarter we have a $250 million problem with Raptor 3 (NPW) if we don't ''enhance'' the capital structure of Raptor 3 to commit more ENE shares. By the way: in Q. 1 we enhanced the Raptor 3 deal, committing more ENE shares to avoid a write-down. 
5. Develop cleanup plan: 
a. Best case: Clean up quietly if possible. 
b. Worst case: Quantify, develop P.R. and I.R. campaigns, customer assurance plans (don't want to go the way of Salomon's trading shop), legal actions, severance actions, disclosure. 
6. Personnel to quiz confidentially to determine if I'm all wet: 
a. Jeff McMahon 
b. Mark Koenig 
c. Rick Buy 
d. Greg Walley 
To put the accounting treatment in perspective I offer the following: 
1. We've contributed contingent Enron equity to the Raptor entities. Since it's contingent, we have the consideration given and received at zero. We do, as Causey points out, include the shares in our fully diluted computations of shares outstanding if the current economics of the deal imply that Enron will have to issue the shares in the future. This impacts 2002-2004 earnings-per-share projections only. 
2. We lost value in several equity investments in 2000, $500 million of lost value. These were fair-value investments; we wrote them down. However, we also booked gains from our price risk management transactions with Raptor, recording a corresponding PRM account receivable from the Raptor entities. That's a $500 million related party transaction -- it's 20 percent of 2000 IBIT, 51 percent of NI pretax, 33 percent of NI after tax. 
3. Credit reviews the underlying capitalization of Raptor, reviews the contingent shares and determines whether the Raptor entities will have enough capital to pay Enron its $500 million when the equity derivatives expire. 
4. The Raptor entities are technically bankrupt; the value of the contingent Enron shares equals or is just below the PRM account payable that Raptor owes Enron. Raptor's inception-to-date income statement is a $500 million loss. 
5. Where are the equity and debt investors that lost out? LJM is whole on a cash-on-cash basis. Where did the $500 million in value come from? It came from Enron shares. Why haven't we booked the transaction as $500 million in a promise of shares to the Raptor entity and $500 million of value in our ''economic interests'' in these entities? Then we would have a write-down of our value in the Raptor entities. We have not booked the latter, because we do not have to yet. Technically we can wait and face the music in 2002-2004. 
6. The related party footnote tries to explain these transactions. Don't you think that several interested companies, be they stock analysts, journalists, hedge fund managers, etc., are busy trying to discover the reason Skilling left? Don't you think their smartest people are poring over that footnote disclosure right now? I can just hear the discussions -- ''it looks like they booked a $500 million gain from this related party company and I think, from all the undecipherable half-page on Enron's contingent contributions to this related party entity, I think the related party entity is capitalized with Enron stock.'' . . . . ''No, no, no, you must have it all wrong, it can't be that, that's just too bad, too fraudulent, surely AA & Co. wouldn't let them get away with that?'' ''Go back to the drawing board, it's got to be something else. But find it!'' . . . . ''Hey, just in case you might be right, try and find some insiders or 'redeployed' former employees to validate your theory.''

THE NATION THE ENRON INQUIRY Memo Warned of Enron's Setup Being Seen as 'Hoax' Probe: Full text suggests that a senior executive was not telling Kenneth Lay anything new. She ridicules accounting procedures and forecasts the company's collapse.

HOUSTON -- A detailed road map of Enron Corp.'s aggressive accounting maneuvers and an uncannily accurate prediction of the company's collapse were laid before Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay in August in a lengthy memo that became public Tuesday. 
Excerpts of the memo had been released by congressional investigators Monday, but the full extent of the warnings became known only Tuesday with the release of the entire text.
The author of the memo, Sherron Watkins, 42, expressed concern that the company's vaunted business success would eventually become considered "nothing but an elaborate accounting hoax." Watkins, a vice president of corporate development at Enron, worked directly under the architect of Enron's complex and highly questionable financial dealings. 
Watkins focused particularly on what were known as the "Raptor" transactions, in which Enron transferred several marginal investments to a putatively independent partnership. The partnership had gone virtually bankrupt by last summer, but Enron still was not disclosing the loss to shareholders, Watkins said. 
The full text suggests that Watkins did not believe she was telling Lay much that he did not already know--and that many of the company's financial transactions were mere accounting shams. 
She attempted to persuade Lay either to reverse the offending transactions promptly or to disclose them fully to shareholders and "develop damage containment plans." Lay did neither. 
"Her motivation is not vindication or being proven right or bringing down the company," her husband, Richard, said Tuesday from the family home in Houston. "She's a team player." 
Watkins went to work at Enron Tuesday morning as news of her memo was splashed across the front pages. 
"It's a normal day," said her lawyer, Philip Hilder, although he acknowledged that "it's very difficult for anybody to go to work under these circumstances." 
Watkins has suffered no retaliation from anyone at the company, the lawyer said, although a source close to her said Watkins has been made to feel "an outcast." 
Sherron Watkins, the daughter of two secondary school educators, grew up in the distant Houston suburb of Tomball and graduated from the University of Texas. 
Tuesday morning, television news trucks jammed the street in front of the Watkins home. Later that day, Richard Watkins praised his wife for doing "something quite courageous. She has the strength of her convictions. But she's very vulnerable." 
A neighbor said the hint of moral indignation in Watkins' memo to Lay was genuine. 
"Clearly she thought it was her moral and professional duty to do what she did," said Carrie Wood, who also was Watkins' sorority sister at UT. "Sherron was drawn to the dynamic intellectual challenge of being an Enron vice president. I don't think she was drawn to the materialistic greed that sprang out of it." 
Word of Enron's accounting irregularities leaked out slowly during the fall, depressing the company's already-dropping stock price. Its businesses destroyed and its reputation in tatters, Enron finally filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Dec. 2. 
Watkins wrote her memo on the heels of the surprise resignation Aug. 14 of Enron Chief Executive Jeffrey K. Skilling. The corporate announcement of Skilling's departure ascribed it to "personal reasons." 
But to Watkins and others inside the company, the move hinted at his deep unease at the accounting irregularities and presaged a difficult period of public scrutiny. 
"I think he . . . looked down the road and knew this stuff was unfixable, and would rather abandon ship now than resign in shame in 2 years," she wrote to Lay. Moreover, she warned, "the probability of discovery significantly increased with Skillings's shocking departure. Too many people are looking for a smoking gun." 
Many of Enron's financial maneuvers would not bear that scrutiny, she said, even though they had been formally approved byEnron's outside auditor, Andersen, formerly known as Arthur Andersen. 
'We're Such a Crooked Company' 
This particularly applied to deals Enron had made with LJM, a partnership that had been set up to trade with Enron and was managed by Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow. The goal was to move debt and other liabilities off Enron's books, where they would have a negative effect on the company's financial picture, and park them with a putatively independent company. As long as these liabilities remained secret, Enron's reputation, and its stock price, remained buoyant. 
The LJM deals inspired deep unease within Enron, Watkins related, quoting one colleague remarking: "I know it would be devastating to all of us but I wish we would get caught. We're such a crooked company." 
Lay responded to Watkins' letter by meeting with her personally and persuading the Enron board to commission an internal review by Vinson & Elkins, one of Enron's Houston law firms. 
Robert S. Bennett, Enron's Washington attorney, defended the company's response. The nine-page review of Watkins' concerns by Vinson & Elkins issued Oct. 15 shows "the good faith of Ken Lay and the company. . . . It shows that they meaningfully looked into this." 
Bennett said the law firm interviewed Watkins but that it put "a lot of faith in Arthur Andersen." 
Watkins, however, had specifically warned Lay against allowing Vinson & Elkins to conduct the investigation. 
"Can't use V&E due to conflict," she wrote in her memo. "They provided some true sale opinions on some of the deals." 
In other words, she argued that the firm would be ruling on the propriety of legal opinions it had itself issued. 
Moreover, the law firm said in its report, written by Vinson partner Max Hendrick III and addressed to Enron General Counsel James V. Derrick Jr., that it was specifically instructed by Enron not to "second guess . . . the accounting advice and treatment" provided by Andersen. The report stated that Enron and Andersen representatives acknowledged that the accounting treatment of the suspect transactions "is creative and aggressive," but it did not conclude that it was "inappropriate from a technical standpoint." 
Vinson & Elkins spokesman Joe Householder declined to discuss whether it was a conflict of interest for the firm to investigate Watkins' allegations. 
"We are not in a position to talk about our engagements with Enron or any other client," he said. 
As it happens, the firm overruled almost all of Watkins' substantive objections to the LJM transactions, although it did acknowledge some "awkwardness" arising from LJM's executives serving as Enron officers. 
"Transactions were negotiated between Enron employees acting [for] Enron and other Enron employees acting for LJM," the law firm's report stated. 
It also noted that within Enron there was widespread suspicion that the Enron employees representing LJM were enjoying special perquisites, including higher compensation. But it said the awkwardness would be eliminated in the future because LJM executives were leaving the Enron payroll and relocating their offices from its headquarters building. 
Focus on the 'Raptor' Deals 
The report did, however, provide indirect evidence of Enron's custom of minimizing the public disclosure of the nature of its financial maneuvers. Among other things, the company gave its outside lawyers little opportunity to examine closely the financial reports and other documents it was releasing for public consumption. 
"Enron's practice is to provide its financial statements and disclosure materials to V&E with a relatively short time frame within which to respond with comments," the report stated. 
In her memo, Watkins focused most heavily on several transactions between Enron and LJM known as the Raptor deals. The term referred to a special business entity that Enron had established to hold several investments that were expensive and of possibly marginal value, including ownership in a broadband communications company called Rhythms NetConnections and other technology and energy companies. 
To cover the LJM-Raptor acquisition of the investments, Enron pledged shares of its own stock and that of some of its subsidiaries. But it also engaged in a series of complicated derivatives deals aimed at hedging the possibility that the value of Rhythms and the other assets would fall. 
In 2000, Watkins noted, Enron went as far as to record more than $500 million in revenue from those derivatives deals. That, she said, presented numerous problems. 
For one thing, Enron had not received the $500 million from LJM. Rather, the payment was conditioned on the value of the underlying investments remaining high; if the investments deteriorated, there was an increasing chance that Enron would never receive the money. 
Further, it was likely that a truly independent company would not have paid anywhere near $500 million for the investments at issue--meaning that the deal was not legitimately an arm's-length sale. 
Vinson & Elkins acknowledged this, noting in its report that LJM "permitted Enron to close transactions that otherwise could not have been accomplished." 
In fact, as the value of the investments dropped, Enron was obligated to make up the difference by paying LJM more of its own stock. 
Throughout 2001 the underlying investments did fall in value--and so did the value of Enron stock. That meant the company had to contribute vastly more shares to LJM than it ever anticipated. That was a contingency that was never fully disclosed to the public or Enron's shareholders, who stood to lose value in their own shares as more were pledged to LJM. 
"It sure looks to the layman on the street that we are hiding losses in a related company and will compensate that company with Enron stock in the future," Watkins wrote. 
Not until Nov. 8 did Enron fully disclose the nature of the Raptor deals--as part of its public announcement that the improper accounting of those transactions and others resulted in its overstating its earnings by $586 million over a nearly five-year period. 
The announcement all but destroyed any chance that the company would be able to survive in its existing form. 
Addiction to Accounting Tricks 
Enron critic Mark Roberts, president of Off Wall Street Consulting Group, a Cambridge, Mass.-based stock research firm, said the Watkins memo adds to the evidence of Enron's addiction to illegitimate accounting tricks. 
The Raptor deals were derivative transactions "with recourse," meaning deals in which the counter-party would be compensated for any losses, he noted in an interview. 
"If the buyer doesn't have risk, the risk stays with Enron and has to be reflected on their balance sheet," said Roberts, whose firm sold Enron shares "short," a bet that they would fall, as early as last May.

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE EMPLOYEE
Author of Letter To Enron Chief Is Called Tough
By JIM YARDLEY

The New York Times

c. 2002 New York Times Company

HOUSTON, Jan. 15 -- In the cutthroat business culture of the Enron Corporation, where toughness and a sharp tongue were often prerequisites for success, Sherron S. Watkins could be noticeably tough and sharp. 
One former colleague described her as ''a bull in the china shop'' at times. Others mistook the Texan Ms. Watkins for a brusque New Yorker. But several former colleagues agreed that her toughness was rooted in a strong sense of business ethics and that she was unafraid to deliver difficult news, even to her superiors.
''In my experience, she was not afraid to speak the truth, even when it was uncomfortable,'' said Stephen Schwarz, a former Enron employee who worked with Ms. Watkins and described her as ''the consummate professional.'' 
Ms. Watkins, a vice president for corporate development at Enron, has emerged as a central figure in the federal investigations into the company, after a Congressional subcommittee released a letter she sent in August to Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman. [Text, Page C6.] 
Written months before the company laid off more than 4,000 workers and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in December, the letter warned that improper accounting practices threatened to destroy the company even as Mr. Lay was reassuring investors and employees. 
That Ms. Watkins, who came to Enron eight years ago after working at the Arthur Andersen accounting firm, would confront her bosses with such a pointed message did not startle those who knew her. 
''Now that I've read what she wrote, I'm not in the least bit surprised that it was her,'' one former Enron colleague said. 
Another Enron employee said word that Ms. Watkins had confronted Mr. Lay began to circulate through the company at some point after she had sent the letter and had a subsequent audience with the chairman. 
''Rumors were floating that she knew some things that were going on and that she had apparently voiced some concerns,'' said a former employee of Enron Broadband Services, a division where Ms. Watkins once worked. 
Ms. Watkins, who is 42 and still works at Enron, declined to comment today, but her lawyer, Philip H. Hilder, said his client had written the letter as an act of conscience. 
''She thought it was the right thing to do, to ask some questions,'' Mr. Hilder said. ''I think that was her only motivation. She saw that there were some problems, and she was concerned.'' 
The investigations into Enron are focused at least in part on a series of off-the-books partnerships that were reportedly used to inflate the company's profits by hiding its losses, including those involving the company's former chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow. The partnerships involving Mr. Fastow, who was fired in October amid growing investor concern, are central to the Securities and Exchange Commission's investigation of Enron's accounting. 
Ms. Watkins's lawyer said his client reported directly to Mr. Fastow last summer after being reassigned to his office from the broadband unit. 
In her letter to Mr. Lay, Ms. Watkins did not mince words in discussing four of those partnerships. 
''Has Enron become a risky place to work?'' she asked. ''For those of us who didn't get rich over the last few years, can we afford to stay?'' 
Like many other Enron employees, Ms. Watkins first worked at Arthur Andersen, the Big Five accounting firm that has also come under federal scrutiny after it was disclosed that Andersen employees had destroyed thousands of pages of Enron documents in recent months. One former Enron colleague, whose career also began at Andersen, said Ms. Watkins, then Sherron Smith, started around 1982 as an auditor in Andersen's Houston office. 
Another employee in the same Andersen office was Jeffrey McMahon, who would later become Enron's treasurer. 
''She was very good friends with Jeff McMahon,'' a former Enron colleague said, noting that each had married later in life and started a family. 
It was Mr. McMahon who in 2000 complained to Jeffrey Skilling, then Enron's president, about the partnerships connected to Mr. Fastow, people close to Enron say. Mr. McMahon was later reassigned to another position. Mr. Skilling ascended to chief executive, only to leave abruptly last August after six months in the post. 
Ms. Watkins's career at Andersen took her to New York until she left to join Enron, where she steadily rose to the position of corporate vice president. Colleagues say she first worked on international projects. 
''She could swear up a blue streak,'' said a former colleague who worked with Ms. Watkins on international deals. ''She came down with a tough New Yorker confidence that could carry her in a predominantly men's world.'' 
While Ms. Watkins could be abrasive, that colleague added, her ethics were unassailable. 
Eventually, she was assigned to the broadband unit, where colleagues say her responsibilities included reining in costs. She earned a reputation as being outspoken at meetings. One former Enron executive said Ms. Watkins alienated some employees, who pointedly sought not to work for her. But, the executive added, ''I have never heard anyone question her judgment, her integrity and her veracity. I never heard anybody say she cut corners.'' 
Mr. Schwarz, the former broadband colleague who regarded her highly, described her as ''a New Yorker amidst Texans.'' 
In fact, Ms. Watkins grew up in a small town north of Houston and later attended the University of Texas. Her husband, Richard, declined to comment today at their home in the city's affluent Southampton neighborhood. 
A neighbor, Carrie Wood, said she and Ms. Watkins were sorority sisters in college and painted a softer picture of her friend. She described Ms. Watkins as a doting mother who dedicated all her time away from Enron to her young daughter. 
''She's bright and she's humble and she's thoughtful and deliberate and she's morally sound,'' said Ms. Wood, who described Ms. Watkins as an active Christian who participated in Bible study. ''She's a bright, confident businesswoman, too.'' 
Another neighbor, Chris Cagley, an independent accountant who did business with Enron, said he had on occasion bumped into Ms. Watkins on their street and in the Enron lobby. 
''Now that I know that she wrote this mystery memo, I would say I have a newfound respect for this person,'' Mr. Cagley. ''Because it's not easy to stand up and point out things that are wrong in corporate America. It's much easier to let it go.''

THE NATION A Regular Life in Unusual Times Profile: Enron insider Sherron Watkins led a quiet existence before becoming a key figure in the firm's scandal.

HOUSTON -- She goes to Bible study class and buys cookies from every Girl Scout who comes to the door. She gave $40 to the neighborhood association for tree planting, which earned her the rank of "regular," not quite "patron" or "sustaining." 
Sherron Watkins, 42, became a national figure in the Enron Corp. affair this week after the disclosure of her August letter warning fellow company executives of questionable accounting measures. But friends say Watkins, an Enron vice president, has tried not to let the growing scandal at her company overwhelm her life.
The last time Carrie Wood, Watkins' neighbor and former sorority sister, saw her friend was Sunday. Wood asked how she was. 
"I've gotten an SEC [Securities and Exchange Commission] subpoena," Watkins said. 
"For documents? Or for you?" Wood asked. 
"Both," Watkins said. 
But she appeared normal, Wood said, noting that "she was going off to buy her daughter some shoes." 
Watkins lives in Southampton, a pleasant, tree-lined Houston neighborhood with big but not extravagant houses nestled close together. A few blocks away is Rice University, where she runs up the stadium steps to keep fit. 
Watkins and her husband, Richard, who works in oil and gas financing for a Canadian company, and their 2-year-old daughter live in a gray saltbox-style home with a large American flag out front. On Tuesday morning, television news trucks filled the street, but by afternoon they had given up their quest for an interview and left. 
Like the street, the inside of the Watkins house was quiet, domestic--golf clubs on the study floor, family photos on the walls and tables, an empty beer bottle near the door. Richard Watkins had a clipboard on which he was noting who called and what they wanted. It was a long list. 
The husband didn't want to talk much, but neighbors were glad to offer testimonials. 
"She's very professional--we keep it just neighbors," said Chris Cagley, who lives across the street. 
Cagley worked for Enron too, as a contract employee, but he said he never discussed office matters with Watkins. Her role in calling attention to the questionable practices came as a surprise to him when he picked up the Tuesday paper. He was filled with admiration. 
"You know how corporations are," he said. "No one wants to stand out, to say anything bad. But Sherron wanted to inform people, to let them know what was going on." 
Meanwhile, Watkins' attorney, Philip Hilder, was being besieged by the news media in his new downtown offices, which are still under construction. He did simultaneous TV interviews, perfecting the art of saying nothing. 
"We fully anticipate we will be subpoenaed to appear" before Congress and other regulatory hearings, he said repeatedly. 
Hilder, a former federal prosecutor who specializes in white-collar criminal defense, responded to one interviewer who asked if he had handled a case like this before: 
"Has anybody handled anything like this before?"

Law Firm Releases Enron E-Mails Detailing Lockdown

01/16/2002
Dow Jones News Service

(This story was first published Tuesday) 

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- One of the law firms representing Enron Corp.'s (ENE) employees in their 401(k) lawsuit against the company released two internal e-mails showing conflicting dates regarding the start of the lockdown period for the company's 401(k) plan.
The press release, issued by Gottesdiener Law Firm, is a possible indication of the tactics the plaintiffs will use in pursuing their claims against Enron. In the release, Gottesdiener also claims the lockdown wasn't administratively necessary at all. 
As reported, some employees of the bankrupt energy concern are suing, claiming a lockdown of the Enron plan to make administrative changes prevented all employees from selling Enron shares during that time. During the lockdown, the company's stock price collapsed. 
An Enron spokesman couldn't immediately be reached for comment on the latest press release. Enron has previously said the lockdown was for 10 days, from Oct. 29 to Nov. 12, and has defended the move as being essential to allow employee account information to be accurately and completely transferred to a new administrator. 
In the Tuesday press release, Gottesdiener said an e-mail sent on Sept. 27 was the company's initial announcement to employees about the lockdown. The e-mail, available for viewing at www.enronsuit.com, told employees that the lockdown would begin on Oct. 19 and last one month. 
"To ensure that records and individual accounts are converted accurately," the e-mail said, "a transition period of approximately one-month will begin Oct. 19." 
"During the transition period," the e-mail continued, "participants are not able to transfer funds among investment options or request a withdrawal." 
However, a second e-mail, sent on Oct. 25 and also available on the Web site, appears to provide contradictory information, stating the lockdown would begin Oct. 26. 
Gottesdiener said the e-mails show that the company issued false information, leading many workers to believe that the lockdown began a week earlier than it actually did and causing them to miss the opportunity to sell their stock when it was still trading for around $30 a share. 
Attorney Eli Gottesdiener said Enron issued another e-mail on Nov. 14 at night informing employees the lockdown had been lifted Nov. 13. 
On Dec. 14, Enron had defended criticism of the 401(k) lockdown in a statement, saying a temporary shutdown is required when companies change 401(k) administrators in order to allow employee account information to be accurately and completely transferred to the new administrator. 
Enron said then that it mailed a notice to the homes of all affected employees Oct. 4, to announce a transition to the new 401(k) administrator would begin Oct. 29. The company said it also sent several internal e-mail reminders between the two dates. 
Enron said the transition period during which employees couldn't change investments lasted "just 10 total trading days," from Monday, Oct. 29 to Monday, Nov. 12, and applied to all plan participants, including senior executives. The company said that from the first day of the temporary plan shutdown to Tuesday, Nov. 13, the first day participants could transfer funds, its closing share price fell from $13.81 to $9.98, a drop of $3.83, or 28%. 
On five days during the lockdown, Enron said, its stock closed below $9.98. On Friday, Oct. 26, the last day before the lockdown began, Enron's stock closed at $15.41. - By Stephen Lee, Dow Jones Newswires; 201.938.5400

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE INVESTIGATION
Justice Dept.'s Inquiry Into Enron Is Beginning to Take Shape, Without Big Names
By DAVID JOHNSTON

01/16/2002
The New York Times
Page 7, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

WASHINGTON, Jan. 15 -- With Attorney General John Ashcroft and virtually the entire legal staff of the United States attorney's office in Houston disqualified from the Enron criminal investigation, the Justice Department has been forced to rapidly assemble a pickup team of prosecutors and investigators to unravel Enron's collapse. 
The mammoth white-collar fraud inquiry, which focuses on an energy trading company that has been a big Republican donor and supporter of both President Bush and Mr. Ashcroft, is emerging as the most politically sensitive case yet confronted by the Bush administration. Overall, the investigation will be under the direction of Larry D. Thompson, the deputy attorney general, and his subordinates in the department's criminal division.
Mr. Thompson is proving to be a reliable second-in-command for Mr. Ashcroft and the White House. A top federal prosecutor in Atlanta during the presidency of Mr. Bush's father, Mr. Thompson won his credentials with the Bush camp in 1991 when he helped guide Clarence Thomas through a tumultuous confirmation as a Supreme Court justice. 
On Jan. 10, Mr. Ashcroft, along with David Ayres, his chief of staff, recused himself from the criminal investigation of the company's collapse. The case was then referred to a Washington-led task force. Mr. Ashcroft's associates have said he took the step to avoid any criticism of conflict of interest because he had accepted campaign donations from Enron. Mr. Ashcroft received more than $50,000 from the company and its chairman, Kenneth L. Lay, for his 2000 Senate campaign. 
Some Democratic groups argue that Mr. Thompson, too, has ties to Enron. In Atlanta he was a lawyer at the firm King & Spalding, which represented Enron, but he himself did no work for Enron, a Justice Department official said today. 
So far the department has avoided the appointment of a special counsel, a step that would force it to relinquish control to an outside prosecutor and deepen the impression that the case represents a serious conflict for the Bush administration. 
The criminal investigation itself will be centered in Houston, where Enron is based. But the Justice Department is being forced to recruit a fresh team of prosecutors because Michael T. Shelby, the United States attorney in Houston, and virtually the entire legal staff of Mr. Shelby's office were disqualified on grounds that they were acquainted with Enron employees. 
Mr. Shelby's brother-in-law is a lawyer for Enron North America and was among those Enron stockholders who lost substantial sums when the company's stock plummeted. Mr. Shelby said that several of his employees had ties to former and current Enron workers, some of whom could be witnesses in the case. 
Justice Department officials have declined to specify how many lawyers disqualified themselves and said they did not yet know how many will be reassigned to Houston. F.B.I. officials said that a large number of agents trained in forensic accounting would be temporarily moved to Houston for the case. 
The Federal Bureau of Investigation's own task force on the Enron case will be headed by Joseph L. Ford, an F.B.I. agent for 20 years who has led several of the bureau's complex health care fraud investigations and helped organize the investigation of the financial transactions behind the Sept. 11 terror attacks, government officials said. 
Law enforcement officials said that the initial focus of the criminal inquiry is on whether the company defrauded investors or federal regulators as it set up risky outside partnership deals that contributed to the company's bankruptcy. But privately, some officials said that investigators were at the fledgling stage of the inquiry and had no idea what they would find. 
For that reason, they said it was far too early to discuss what violations they might find as they scour the company looking for documents and cooperative witnesses. Among the areas of scrutiny will be the destruction of Enron-related documents by Arthur Andersen, the company's auditing firm. 
Justice Department officials said that Joshua Hochberg, head of the department's fraud section, would supervise the inquiry with the rank of a United States attorney -- making him an equal to other United States attorneys involved in the case in New York, San Francisco and the District of Columbia. Mr. Hochberg will report to Michael Chertoff, head of the criminal division. 
On a day-to-day basis the case will be managed by Leslie R. Caldwell, who was chief of the securities fraud section of the United States attorney's office in San Francisco. Ms. Caldwell had been a senior trial lawyer in Brooklyn until 1999, when Robert S. Mueller III, now the F.B.I. director, recruited her for the Northern California job while he was United States attorney in San Francisco. 
The Justice Department criminal inquiry, while potentially the most serious and far-reaching of the investigations, is only one of a number under way among executive branch agencies. The Labor Department has been examining how the company dealt with employee retirement plans in the weeks before Enron's bankruptcy filing on Dec. 2. The Securities and Exchange Commission has been investigating transactions between Enron and outside partnership deals and the company's relationship with Arthur Andersen. 
Today, Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, a Maryland Democrat and head of the Senate Banking Committee, said he had asked the Congressional investigative arm, the General Accounting Office, to examine laws regulating employee stock ownership in retirement plans and whether failures in accounting practices increased the risks of the company's failure. 
Two other Senate inquiries are being conducted by Democrats on the Governmental Affairs Committee. The investigations are emerging as the Democrats' most significant investigative effort since they took control of the Senate in June. 
Many Democrats were highly critical of Republican-led investigations into accusations of improprieties by the Clinton administration. Now the Democrats, who have benefited to a lesser extent from Enron contributions, risk being accused of staging politically motivated inquiries aimed at a company with well-known Republican connections. 
''I am very concerned that this is going to become highly politicized,'' said Robert S. Bennett, an Enron lawyer and a veteran of Washington scandals as a onetime lawyer for former President Bill Clinton. 
Mr. Bennett added: ''If it does become highly politicized, a lot of people are going to get hurt. A lot of reforms which might come about will not be enacted, and this will be just a typical major league Washington mess with blood all over the place and little accomplished.'' 
But Mr. Bennett's first problem is elsewhere on Capitol Hill. Mr. Lay is scheduled to testify early next month. His appearance could be a turning point in public perceptions about the company. He must give accurate testimony but avoid providing further ammunition for criminal investigators. 
Mr. Lay will testify before the Senate Commerce Committee, which is investigating how Enron employees who held company stock in retirement plans were barred from selling their stock as it plummeted -- leaving many retirees in serious financial straits. 
On the same day, Mr. Lay will testify before the House Financial Services Committee. It has focused its inquiry on the impact of Enron's collapse on investors and markets. 
The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, headed by Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, is conducting an inquiry centered on whether regulators like the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission should have uncovered problems sooner. Mr. Lieberman's panel is scheduled to hold a hearing on Jan. 24. 
One of the Governmental Affairs subcommittees, an investigations panel whose chairman is Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, is conducting its own inquiry. Mr. Levin's subcommittee has prepared 51 subpoenas for documents related to the operations of the company, its executives and its outside auditor. 
Two other House committees are also investigating the company. The House Energy and Commerce Committee has been investigating Enron's accounting practices. The House Education and Workforce Committee has been looking into employees' retirement plans.

Deals & Deal Makers: NYSE Halts Trading in Enron, Moves to Delist Energy Company
By Gaston F. Ceron and Christina Cheddar
Dow Jones Newswires

NEW YORK -- The New York Stock Exchange said it is suspending trading in Enron Corp. and moved to delist the energy company's shares from the Big Board. 
The NYSE said that it "has determined that the company's securities are no longer suitable for trading on the NYSE." The exchange's action affects not only Enron stock, but also other Enron securities, such as preferred convertible stock.
Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said the NYSE's decision wasn't a surprise to the company. "This will have no effect on our business," Ms. Denne said. 
In a separate statement late yesterday afternoon, Enron said its common stock will be now traded as an over-the-counter security under the symbol ENRNQ. Quotation services will be provided by Pink Sheets LLC. Formerly known as the National Quotation Bureau, the New York company provides pricing and financial information for over-the-counter securities. "Investors should call their brokers for daily pricing and volume information," the statement said. 
Enron's collapse last year triggered a huge drop in the company's stock -- sending it down to mere pennies a share -- and massive layoffs at the Houston-based company. Enron filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-court protection on Dec. 2. 
The NYSE moved to delist Enron after the company's stock traded below the critical level of $1 for 30 consecutive days, placing it in violation of the Big Board's listing standards. 
"The exchange notes that today's action is being taken due to the expected protracted nature of the company's bankruptcy process and the uncertainty at this time as to the timing and outcome of this process, as well as the ultimate effect on the company's common shareholders," the NYSE said. 
The exchange said it will apply to the Securities and Exchange Commission to delist Enron securities "upon the completion of applicable procedures, including any appeal by the company of the NYSE staff's decision." 
The most recent time that Enron shares traded at the NYSE was Thursday. Trading in the shares has been halted since then.

NYSE Moves to Delist Enron Stock

Enron Corp.'s fall Tuesday from the august New York Stock Exchange to the lowest tier of securities trading--the unregulated "pink sheets"--reflects deep skepticism about the energy-trading firm's past and future, experts said. 
At this point, few financial institutions will allow their names to appear in the same news report as Enron if they can help it. The NYSE, in its announcement Tuesday that it is suspending trading in Enron pending an official delisting, avoided pointed language. Instead, the exchange chose to explain the move by citing the likelihood of a "protracted" bankruptcy, and uncertainty "as to the timing and outcome of this process as well as the ultimate effect on the company's common shareholders."
The NYSE's technical basis for suspending trading--the first step toward booting the stock off the market--was that Enron's shares have failed to close above $1 for more than a month. That is one of the grounds for delisting under NYSE rules. 
But the exchange has plenty of leeway in allowing companies to trade even after a descent into penny-stock territory, if market officials see residual value for shareholders, and a benefit for the NYSE itself. 
One example is Bethlehem Steel, which has traded below $1 on the NYSE since the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Oct. 15. The stock ended at 51 cents Tuesday. Also, Finova Group, a finance firm that exited Chapter 11 last August, has spent the last two months below $1. 
The NYSE temporarily halted trading in Enron on Friday, and that halt lasted through Tuesday. 
Enron said its stock now will trade in the so-called pink sheet market under the symbol ENRNQ. It was quoted there Tuesday at 50 cents. 
Pink sheet stocks are traded between brokers; prices can be viewed at www.pinksheets.com. 
Shares of bankrupt companies frequently turn out to be worthless when the companies reorganize. Thus, many experts say most trading in Enron shares will be sheer speculation. "It's just hoping that you buy low and the stock shoots up for a day on some news," said Jon Schotz, head of Santa Monica investment bank Saybrook Capital. "You're gambling. Red or black." 
But Lawrence E. Harris, a professor of finance at the USC business school, said good reasons may exist for the NYSE and other markets to continue listing companies that have fallen on hard times. Flexibility in selling stock to record losses for tax purposes can be important for shareholders, he said. Also, exchanges may not want to lose listings of bankrupt companies that will emerge, reorganized, as solid operations with new common shares, he said. 
Harris also said bond holders and other creditors of bankrupt firms, whose claims take precedence, sometimes allow stockholders to retain valuable interests as an incentive to get companies out of bankruptcy more quickly. 
Enron, however, is a different matter, especially because its accounting irregularities may have been outright fraud and, at the very least, are inconsistent with NYSE requirements for accurate financial reporting, Harris said. 
"The NYSE does not want its list to be depreciated by a rogue firm," he said.

Accord for Enron Trading Operations Leaves UBS Free Not to Inject Capital
By Mitchell Pacelle
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

The Wall Street Journal

NEW YORK -- Enron Corp.'s agreement to sell its North American trading operations to UBS AG doesn't require the Swiss concern to inject any minimum amount of capital into the operations, nor supply any minimum amount of credit, according to documents released yesterday. 
Furthermore, UBS has the right to terminate the agreement on short notice, according to lawyers who have studied the documents. The accord to sell the operations in exchange for a slice of the unit's future profits was detailed in bankruptcy-court filings.
As previously reported, UBS's investment-banking arm, UBS Warburg, won't pay any cash for Enron's trading operations, which were once the company's largest source of profits. Instead, UBS will pay royalties to Enron amounting to one-third of the energy-trading enterprise's pretax profit for as much as 10 years. 
The deal gives UBS a series of options to begin buying out Enron's royalty interest in year three of the agreement, the documents say. UBS's options can be exercised in three steps, each representing one-third of the royalty stream. UBS would pay Enron 5.75 times Enron's prior-year payment for each one-third share of royalty eliminated. 
UBS spokesman David Walker declined to provide details about the new venture until after a bankruptcy-court hearing on the deal scheduled for Friday. 
"This is an extremely positive deal for Enron and its creditors that confirms the substantial value of Enron's trading operation," Enron Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey McMahon said in a statement.

SWITZERLAND: UBS says has no acquisition plans for Enron Europe.

01/16/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

ZURICH, Jan 16 (Reuters) - UBS AG has no plans to expand Enron's business in Europe through acquisitions, Peter Wuffli, president of the executive board, said on Wednesday. 
"There are no plans ... for acquisitions in Europe," Wuffli told reporters prior to an analysts' briefing. UBS won the bidding for Enron's North American wholesale electricity and natural gas trading business earlier this month. Wuffli declined to disclose particulars of the deal, citing legal restrictions.
Regarding the banking group's overall strategy, Wuffli said: "I do feel we are in a shift in our priorities," following a decade of acquisitions at the group. "For the first time we are happy with our platform...so the focus will be quite clearly on organic growth." 
Regarding staffing levels, especially in investment banking, "we are going against the trend," Wuffli said. "We do not feel we have overcapacity." He added the group expected markets to recover in the second half of 2002.

UBS CEO Rules Out Big Acqusitions

01/16/2002
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

ZURICH -(Dow Jones)- After a decade of rapid growth and big mergers, UBS AG (Z.UBS) has the size and scale to grow organically, the Swiss banking giant's top executive said Wednesday. 
Peter Wuffli, who heads the group's executive board, said his focus is on making UBS cost-efficient and improving its client base.
"We are still looking at acquisitions and apply our standards, but we don't see any large transformation deals like PaineWebber or the merger with Swiss Bank Corp.," Wuffli said. "We don't have to do a major deal." 

Wuffli, who took the top job at UBS in late December, said he's sticking to statements he has previously made that UBS won't need to make any major layoffs. 
He said UBS learned the hard way that, "the cost of disruption, distraction, motivation of staff is high." 
"Positively, there is a premium to stability," he said. 
This is one reason why UBS won't be following rivals who have announced big cuts in staff over the past two quarters. 
The other reason, he said, is UBS is confident markets will recover in the second half of this year. 
"We don't want to miss that," Wuffli said. 
But he said UBS won't veer from its strategy even if a recovery is delayed by a quarter or two. 
The only reason to possibly reassess its personnel stance would be if there were a major unexpected political or financial crisis. 
UBS wants to increase cooperation between its wealth-management business and their investment banking activities. 
"There are more synergies to be realized if the units can work more closely together," he said. 
UBS is stressing improvement of its brand-name. Wuffli said branding hadn't been particularly consistent due largely to all of UBS's mergers with and acquisitions of other companies. 
"We want to raise the profile of our identity for our clients and staff," Wuffli said. 

Wuffli said UBS will steer away from using cheap loans as a way to attract more lucrative investment banking mandates. Many of the Swiss group's rivals have been doing that to beef up investment banking revenues since markets started trending downward. 
"The cross-subsidized corporate finance with credit just doesn't make sense," he said. "We will not buy business with our balance sheet." 
The issue is a particularly contentious one at UBS, and was believed to be a source of tension between group Chairman Marcel Ospel and Wuffli's predecessor, Luqman Arnold, who was ousted in a power struggle late last year. 
UBS Warburg's ties with EchoStar Communications Corp. last year came under strain because - unlike rivals - it wouldn't offer the U.S. satellite-TV operator a $3 billion loan to finance its acquisition of Hughes Electronics Corp. 
UBS Warburg didn't win the mandate to handle the acquisition. That was embarrassing for the investment bank, which had been advising EchoStar on its merger and acquisition options. 
Wuffli has previously denied EchoStar was a factor in the disagreements Ospel and Arnold had over business strategy. 
UBS last week won its bid to buy Enron Corp.'s energy trading activities, and Wuffli said the group is ready to absorb its activities into UBS Warburg. 
"This is an attractive addition to our trading activities. The Enron business will be completely integrated into UBS Warburg," Wuffli said. 
It will also be integrated into the investment bank's risk-management profile and existing risk limits. 
He said the acquisition makes sense and should make UBS Warburg stronger. 
"It's an addition to the product line and means a diversification of revenues," he said. 
He said it will be "quite challenging" to keep Enron's experienced energy traders and, "we will make offers to front personnel and support staff." 
But he said he couldn't say yet how many people would get offers and what the specifics of those offers would be.

Financial Post: Canada
UBS Enron bid values affiliate at US$4M: Enron Canada Corp.: Unit of failed parent holds cash of at least $220-million

Financial Post

CALGARY - A bid by UBS Warburg to take over the trading operations of Enron Corp. assigns little value to its cash-rich Canadian unit, even though it claimed to be a viable business despite the bankruptcy of its parent. 
The agreement, made public yesterday, says UBS will take over at a cost of no more than US$4-million the intellectual property and technology, trading staff, office space and equipment of the Canadian affiliate, so it can conduct gas and power trading in Canada and with Canadian counterparties "in substantially the manner historically conducted by Enron and its affiliates."
Enron Canada Corp. has at least $220-million in cash from the sale last month of its interest in the Sundance B power-generating plant outside of Edmonton, and is owed more than $100-million by partners that have not honoured their obligations, its chief executive said last week. 
The unit unsuccessfully attempted last month to win court backing for a reorganization so it could re-emerge as an independent operation and distance itself from its parent's bankruptcy. 
Now, Enron Canada "is happy to go along with this" and be part of the UBS bid, said Eric Thode, a spokesman for Enron. 
Under the broader agreement, UBS, the Swiss investment bank, won't pay anything to acquire the trading business, which generated about 90% of the company's US$101-billion in revenue in 2000, nor assume any of the company's debts, but will share a third of the energy operation's profits with Enron and its creditors. 
Brian O'Leary, a lawyer representing many Canadian energy firms with ongoing contracts with Enron Canada, said it looks like the contracts will be liquidated, and any left over money used to pay creditors with the rest sent back to the U.S. parent. 
"A lot still has to be unravelled here," Mr. O'Leary said. "It's going to take a while to calculate damages and find out if [contracts] were properly terminated and determine the full amount payable. Who is going to do that from Enron's point of view? That's the big question we have." 
Jim Joyce, a principal with Risk Advisory, a risk management advisory firm in Calgary, said the deal gives Enron Canada a better balance sheet and the ability to start fresh. 
"They had a lot of cash, but people still weren't dealing with them, because they weren't sure of the long-term implications of that cash, whether it was going to be funnelled back to the States or not. So, having a big balance sheet behind it is certainly better than whatever cash Enron Canada had," Mr. Joyce said. 
It may also mean new jobs for the operation, which recently laid off 75 employees in Calgary and Toronto, because UBS doesn't have an energy trading business in Canada, Mr. Joyce said. 
Gary Gault, vice-president of the Natural Gas Exchange in Calgary, which accounts for about 10% to 15% of natural gas trading in Canada, said he would also welcome Enron's return. "Enron was a very big market maker and created deal flow in the market place," he said. 
But he said the company will find the market has changed since its collapse. 
Enron's share of natural gas and power trading has been taken over by competitors, including NGX, which saw a 15% increase in activity. 
In addition, activity is slower because of reduced commodity price volatility since last winter's energy crisis and because credit conditions are tighter across the industry, he said. 
Enron's activities may be restricted under the new regime. 
"How much will they let them win and how much will they let them lose? Our guess is that they will probably be more scrutinized, that UBS will be very judicious in their management," he said. 
Enron collapsed late last year amid revelations of complex partnerships used to keep billions of dollars in debt off its books and mask financial problems so it could continue to get cash and credit to run the trading business.

WASHINGTON'S HUNT for the great Enron scandal is on. As it unfolds, keep in mind the cardinal rule of such controversies: The real scandal usually lies not in what's illegal, but in what's legal. 
If that principle holds true, the long-term impact of the Enron affair won't be some Bush White House ethics controversy, as Democrats hope. It's more likely to lie in a realization that government failed miserably in its role as regulator of the marketplace.
In that respect, Enron's demise figures to join a list of recent events, including the tragedies of Sept. 11, that are helping to swing the political pendulum away from the deregulatory trends of the 1980s and 1990s. If Enron -- a company that was both the leading disciple and very symbol of the deregulatory mood of recent years -- collapses while regulators were clueless about what it was doing, how could the political effect be otherwise? 
For now, Washington's interest in Enron is a lot less subtle than that: The company run by the president's top political contributor has crumbled, taking the retirement nest eggs of many rank-and-file employees with it. Did the president's people do any favors for the company's executives in its dying days? Did the White House have inside knowledge of the disaster about to befall employees and stockholders that it should have acted upon? 
So far, the answers appear to be no. In many cases, that would be the beginning of the end of Washington's interest. 
But not in this instance. Washington's examination of Enron is shaping up as more than a partisan scandal monger's look for Bush-administration ethical lapses. It has the makings of a more serious, bipartisan look at what went wrong and what government's role should have -- or at least could have -- been in stopping it. 

AS ONE INDICATOR, consider the fact that the most dogged congressional investigator so far isn't a Democrat, but Republican Rep. Billy Tauzin, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. His panel has been looking into Enron's collapse for two months, and he has sought documents from Enron (twice), from its accounting firm Arthur Andersen (twice) and from the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
It was Rep. Tauzin's staff that this week unearthed the damning letter from an Enron official to Chairman Kenneth Lay, warning that the company's practice of hiding its debt in internal partnerships threatened to "implode in a wave of accounting scandals." That discovery prompted a Tauzin request for more documents. 
Rep. Tauzin seems disinclined to give a break either to Enron or to Arthur Andersen for failing to blow the whistle. When it was disclosed that Andersen had destroyed Enron documents, Rep. Tauzin advised simply: "Anyone who destroyed records simply out of stupidity should be fired; anyone who destroyed records intentionally to subvert our investigation should be prosecuted." Andersen appeared to take his advice by dismissing a group of employees yesterday. 
It seems clear that the SEC had no real idea how Enron was massaging its books, and a limited ability to find out, and that there was no real regulatory-oversight system in place to make sure Andersen was doing its job on behalf of the average shareholder. 

THE IMPACT transcends the Enron debacle, because the mess comes at a time when Americans already are rethinking the role government should play in their lives. In a small way, California's electricity crisis and in a large way the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks have prompted a re-evaluation. On Sept. 12, the notion of the government's taking charge of airport security didn't seem like such a bad idea, and Americans who once would have been offended by nosy law-enforcement officials snooping around welcomed the practice. 
Now one can almost sense some similar rethinking of government's role in the marketplace. Many liberals tend to think government should protect consumers from both risk and deceit in the marketplace. Many conservatives tend to think market forces can take care of both risk and deceit. 
A search for a middle ground is under way. Liberals will need to concede that individuals clearly have to handle their own risk, and conservatives will need to agree that government needs to look harder for deceit, and to have the tools to do the job right. A sign of the times came yesterday, when no less a conservative icon than columnist George Will, in the Washington Post, wrote of the Enron case: "It will remind everyone -- some conservatives, painfully -- that a mature capitalist economy is a government project."

Politics & Policy
Law Firm Reassured Enron on Accounting --- Vinson & Elkins Discounted Warnings by Employee About Dubious Dealings
By Wall Street Journal staff reporters Jeanne Cummings and Tom Hamburger in Washington and Kathryn Kranhold in New York

A venerable and politically connected law firm advised Enron Corp. officials not to worry about a company employee's warnings of questionable accounting, based on an inquiry that only canvassed Enron executives and its accountants at Arthur Andersen LLP. 
The report by Vinson & Elkins partner Max Hendricks III, a copy of which was obtained by The Wall Street Journal, concluded that Enron's practice of forming special-purpose entities to keep debt off its books was "creative and aggressive," but that "no one has reason to believe that it is inappropriate from a technical standpoint."
In fact, the subsequent widespread disclosure of those partnerships last fall fueled Enron's downward spiral toward a bankruptcy filing, lawsuits and now government inquiries -- including a federal criminal investigation. The Enron executive whose complaints prompted the Vinson & Elkins review also warned, in an August letter to Enron's chairman, against using Vinson & Elkins to vet her concerns because she believed there was a conflict of interest. 
Vinson partner Ronald Astin also was involved in structuring some of the partnerships, according to an Enron source. 
The expanding Enron scandal also is putting political heat on President Bush and his inner circle. Along with Enron, Houston's Vinson & Elkins has been among the big Texas businesses that have been his biggest political patrons. Of the firm's 341 partners, 165 contributed about $204,000 to Mr. Bush's 2000 campaign, according to Thomas Marinis Jr., a firm partner and boyhood friend of the president's. 
The web of friendships and money threatens to raise additional questions about possible conflicts of interest. For instance, after Commerce Secretary Donald Evans received a call for help from Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay, among those he turned to for advice was his department counsel, Theodore Kassinger. Mr. Kassinger is a former Vinson & Elkins attorney who had done work for Enron on international trade and project-financing matters, according to his public resume. Mr. Kassinger declined a request for an interview. But a Commerce Department spokesman said Mr. Kassinger worked in Washington and knew nothing about Enron partnerships. He also said Mr. Kassinger hadn't been asked for help by any former law firm colleagues. 
White House counsel Alberto R. Gonzales also is an alumnus of Vinson & Elkins -- or V&E, as the Texas legal and political powerhouse is commonly known. Mr. Gonzales left there in 1994, when Mr. Bush, newly elected as Texas governor, picked him to serve as his attorney. 
White House spokesman Dan Bartlett says he is unaware of any contacts between Vinson & Elkins attorneys and administration officials about Enron. "One thing is clear," he adds. "This administration has taken no action to benefit or to attempt to help the Enron company." 
Vinson & Elkins's internal inquiry that ended up reassuring Enron was spurred by an August letter from Enron Global Finance executive Sherron Watkins to Mr. Lay. In it, she raised alarms about the energy firm's unorthodox partnerships and their potential danger to the company's finances and public image. 
"I am incredibly nervous that we will implode in a wave of accounting scandals," Ms. Watkins wrote, according to a copy of the letter obtained by the Journal. "My eight years of Enron work history will be worth nothing on my resume, the business world will consider the past successes as nothing but an elaborate accounting hoax," she added. 
In her letter, Ms. Watkins specifically points to Enron's creation of a partnership called Raptor to help protect it from falling share prices in companies in which it owned stock. As she described the situation, Raptor had to pay Enron if the company stock prices fell. In return, Enron had promised to make up Raptor's losses with shares of Enron stock. When Enron's stock declined throughout the year, the amount needed to make Raptor whole grew significantly. 
Ms. Watkins also raised concerns about whether Enron had properly disclosed the transactions with the partnerships to investors. And she questioned whether Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow had a conflict of interest in forming them. 
She also specifically cautioned Mr. Lay against using Vinson & Elkins "due to conflict." Despite that, Mr. Lay did turn to his longtime allies at the firm. The ties between Enron and Vinson & Elkins date to the early 1980s, prior to when Enron's predecessors, Houston Natural Gas and Internorth, merged. Enron was the law firm's biggest client, though it only accounted for about 7% of its work. 
So close were the firms that, at times, Mr. Lay would pick a local charity, and Vinson & Elkins partners were expected to pony up donations along with Enron, say people familiar with the firm. And just as Mr. Lay and Enron were early givers to the Bush presidential campaign, so, too, was Vinson & Elkins. In early 1999, 140 of its lawyers wrote $1,000 checks in the span of a few days, and bundled them for delivery to Bush headquarters, according to an analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics. Both outfits' executives are among the Bush "Pioneers," supporters who raised at least $100,000 for the candidate. 
Over the years, lawyers at the firm would move in and out of jobs as Enron's in-house attorneys. Enron's general counsel, James Derrick Jr., was a partner at the firm until he joined the energy company in 1991. It was Mr. Derrick, one of the Enron contributors to Mr. Bush, who requested the internal study of Ms. Watkins's concerns. But he imposed two restraints: Don't second-guess the Andersen accountants, and don't analyze every transaction. 
Washington defense attorney Robert Bennett, who is representing Enron, says the limits were imposed because "they wanted an answer to this if they could get one soon." But in hindsight, he concedes, "They probably should have done some other things," such as seeking outside expertise on the accounting questions. 
Vinson & Elkins investigators zeroed in on four areas -- conflicts of interests, the accounting treatment of the partnerships in Enron's financial statement, public disclosures of the partnership transactions and the potential impact on Enron's financial statements because of stock-price declines. 
In each case, they dismissed Ms. Watkins's worries primarily by relying on assurances from Arthur Andersen that the accounting practices were appropriate, according to the report. "In summary, none of the individuals interviewed could identify any transaction between Enron [and the outside partnership] that was not reasonable from Enron's standpoint or that was contrary to Enron's best interests," Mr. Hendrick noted. 
The company believed the conflict of interest largely was resolved when Mr. Fastow severed his connection with the controversial partnerships, but Mr. Hendrick noted that Enron's board twice waived the company's ethics code to allow transactions to go forward. 
The one area where the investigators saw Enron as vulnerable was in its public relations: The transactions could "be portrayed very poorly if subjected to a Wall Street Journal expose or class action lawsuit," they noted in the report. 
The report is dated Oct. 15, 2001. The next day, Mr. Lay disclosed that his company had a loss of $618 million in the third quarter. Shortly later, the complex partnership arrangements were exposed, along with the fact that Enron had used them to conceal billions of dollars in losses. The revelations rocked the company, and led to its Dec. 2 bankruptcy filing. 
Mr. Bennett argues that Mr. Lay would have conducted a more thorough investigation of the partnerships if his attorneys had recommended it. "I think this shows Ken Lay's good faith in the matter," he says of the report. 
Joseph Dilg, Vinson & Elkins's new managing partner, who has worked closely with Enron since the early 1990s, declined to comment on the specifics of the firm's investigation of Enron's partnerships and auditing practices. 
"We remain very comfortable with everything we did," he says. 
But Mr. Dilg says that while the firm could offer legal opinions on certain Enron transactions, it couldn't conduct a review of its accounting practices because it doesn't have expertise. 
"We are not competent to render accounting advice," he says. 
An Andersen spokesmen yesterday declined to comment on the report, referring only to Andersen Chief Executive Joseph Berardino's recent congressional testimony. In that appearance, Mr. Berardino said Andersen made a mistake in accepting Enron's accounting for one of the partnerships, and wouldn't have approved of another if it had known all the details. 
Mr. Dilg says the Securities and Exchange Commission and congressional committees haven't yet contacted him or his partners. But, he adds, the firm has retained Washington's Williams & Connolly as its outside counsel. The firm also has hired well-known Houston lawyer Joe Jamail to handle civil litigation. The firm was named in two Enron-related lawsuits, but those have been withdrawn.

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE LAW FIRM
Legal Counsel In Many Ways Mirrors Client
By JIM YARDLEY with JOHN SCHWARTZ

The New York Times
Page 6, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

HOUSTON, Jan. 15 -- The law firm of Vinson & Elkins, which became publicly enmeshed this week in the Enron scandal, is often described much like its client: hugely powerful, international in scope and rich with connections from the statehouse to the White House. 
The connections that bind Vinson & Elkins to the Enron Corporation were evident long before the House Energy and Commerce Committee demanded documents from the firm on Monday as part of its investigation into Enron's filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. For at least the past five years, Enron has been one of Vinson & Elkins's biggest clients, and last year, Enron accounted for nearly 8 percent of the firm's $455 million in gross revenues.
''I think that probably made them the largest client,'' said Joseph C. Dilg, the managing partner, noting that the firm began representing Enron 15 years ago when it was known as Houston Natural Gas. 
Congressional investigators are looking at a letter sent in August to the Enron chairman, Kenneth L. Lay, in which a vice president at the company, Sherron S. Watkins, warned that accounting practices involving a series of secret financial partnerships could threaten Enron's future. At the time, Enron asked Vinson & Elkins to investigate the issues raised in the letter but limited the scope of the inquiry. 
In a nine-page response on Oct. 15, Vinson & Elkins concluded that Enron did not need a larger investigation into the issues raised in Ms. Watkins's letter but warned that the ''bad cosmetics'' of the partnerships could bring ''a serious risk of adverse publicity and litigation.'' 
Mr. Dilg said the firm was still reviewing the Congressional request for documents and other information. ''We're not trying to be evasive, but we do have professional responsibilities for the clients we work for, and Enron is one of our clients.'' 
Founded in 1917 by James A. Elkins and William A. Vinson, Vinson & Elkins helped create modern Houston. 
Today, Vinson & Elkins has 860 lawyers with nine offices worldwide, ranking as one of the 25 largest firms in the country. Partners earn an average of $655,000 a year. 
According to Texans for Public Justice, a not-for-profit research group tracking money in Texas politics, Vinson & Elkins employees and political action committees gave $133,000 in campaign contributions to George W. Bush in his 1994 and 1998 campaigns for governor. During the 2000 presidential campaign, three of the firm's partners served as ''pioneers,'' each raising more than $100,000 for Mr. Bush's race. 
''They have built their practice in part by building political connections through campaign contributions,'' said Craig McDonald, director of Texans for Public Justice. ''They are by far the largest law firm contributor in the state of Texas.'' 
There are already a plethora of lawsuits filed over Enron, as shareholders, creditors and other plaintiffs are seek redress from the company and its accounting firm, Arthur Andersen. Two shareholder groups had initially included Vinson & Elkins in their suits until the firm hired a prominent lawyer, Joe Jamail, who persuaded the plaintiffs to drop the firm as a defendant. 
Larry Doherty, a prominent legal malpractice attorney in Houston, said Texas statutes states that law firms can be sued for malpractice only by a client. Still, he predicted that any lawyers who have worked for Enron and were involved in reviewing partnerships and other questionable financial transactions could be vulnerable to lawsuits. 
Other lawyers warned against any rush to judgment. Dick DeGuerin, a prominent defense lawyer, compared the current frenzy surrounding Enron to ''the crash of the stock market or the run on a bank.'' He added, ''Everybody's piling on Enron and to some extent Vinson & Elkins.''

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE BANKS
Lenders Differ in Disclosing Their Exposure to Troubles
By PATRICK McGEEHAN with RICHARD W. STEVENSON

The New York Times

The two biggest lenders to Enron have given distinctly different responses to questions about their ties to the failed company. While J. P. Morgan Chase rushed to detail its potential losses, Citigroup has repeatedly rebuffed inquiries. 
But the paths taken by the two investment banks should start to converge over the next two days as they report their earnings for the fourth quarter of 2001. J. P. Morgan is expected to provide new details on the cost of its exposure to Enron today, while Citigroup is expected to end its silence about just how deep its financial ties to Enron went when it discusses its earnings tomorrow.
Unlike J. P. Morgan, Citigroup has declined for several weeks to divulge details of the loans and trading exposures it has to Enron, a giant energy trading company. Analysts said they did not believe that the amounts involved were so big that they had to be disclosed to investors. 
Citigroup apparently had enough involvement with Enron, however, to prompt Robert E. Rubin, chairman of Citigroup's executive committee, to seek help from a senior Treasury Department official. 
Mr. Rubin, who was Treasury secretary before he joined Citigroup, called Peter R. Fisher, the under secretary of the Treasury for domestic finance, on Nov. 8 and broached the subject of Mr. Fisher's possibly calling bond rating agencies in hopes of averting an immediate downgrade of Enron's debt. 
Mr. Fisher rejected the idea and Mr. Rubin accepted his decision, according to the Treasury Department's account of the conversation. 
People close to Mr. Rubin said he called Mr. Fisher in part because Citigroup was a large creditor of Enron and was working for the energy company in an investment banking capacity. But they said Mr. Rubin, who remains prominent in Democratic politics and continues to take a keen interest in public policy issues, was also motivated by concern that the collapse of Enron would have ramifications for the financial markets and the economy. 
Citigroup officials declined to comment yesterday on the reasons for their public silence about the firm's dealings with Enron. Analysts said the company usually declines to discuss its lending relationships. 
Most analysts estimate the net value of Citigroup's exposure to be about $1 billion. But they speculated that because Citigroup has not issued any warnings to investors about its earnings, the company must not expect to lose much of that money. 
In contrast, J. P. Morgan has already said its earnings will be reduced by $220 million for bad loans to Enron, and its trading revenue for the quarter will be reduced by $235 million after the bank marked down the value of trading positions involving the company. 
A Citigroup spokesman declined to say whether Citigroup executives would even mention Enron when they announce earnings tomorrow. But analysts said the company would not try to evade questions about its potential losses related to Enron. 
''I think that could create an extremely contentious discussion with the investment community,'' said Henry McVey, an analyst with Morgan Stanley, who has been recommending Citigroup's shares. 
Mr. McVey said he did not know how Citigroup's exposure to Enron broke down among its units. 
J. P. Morgan, in contrast, has said its exposure includes loans and trading positions, as well as certain bonds issued by insurers -- including the property-casualty unit of Citigroup -- which were backed by some Enron oil and gas contracts. 
''For better or worse, J. P. Morgan's investor relations strategy has been relatively open over the years,'' said Judah Kraushaar, an analyst at Merrill Lynch. ''They got caught in a jam this time, but their intentions were to give the market as much information as possible.'' 
J. P. Morgan originally estimated its exposure to Enron at $900 million, in part because it had counted on recovering on the bonds. But the insurers have balked at paying, and J. P. Morgan is suing them. 
After reassessing all of its potential losses in the Enron debacle, J. P. Morgan said last month that its total exposure to Enron was actually about $2.6 billion. That amount included $965 million on the bonds and $165 million in a letter of credit, as well as loans secured by a natural-gas pipeline and unsecured loans. 
Both Citigroup and J. P. Morgan had also served as investment bankers to Enron. The two firms were advisers to Enron on the proposed sale to Dynegy that might have saved Enron from collapse. Together, they stood to collect advisory fees of about $90 million if Dynegy went through with that acquisition. 
Citigroup's Salomon Smith Barney investment banking unit also underwrote securities for Enron and the various limited partnerships the company controlled. And Salomon was one of six brokerage firms that managed the sale last May of about $150 million of units in an Enron partnership called Northern Border Partners L.P. 
Daniel Noonan, a spokesman for Salomon, declined to say how many of the partnerships the firm helped to sell or to characterize the scope of the firm's involvement with the partnerships. 
Citigroup has disclosed so little, analysts said, that anything it says about Enron will be an improvement. 
''If they say that it is immaterial, that is a piece of information,'' said Diane B. Glossman, an analyst with UBS Warburg. ''If you wait until Thursday afternoon, we will have more information about Enron than we have right now.''

Citigroup's Enron Financing Stirs Controversy
By Jathon Sapsford and Mitchell Pacelle
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

The Wall Street Journal

When Enron Corp. turned to its bankers for money in late October, the energy company needed a quick, big loan to restore investor confidence in its finances. 
Citigroup Inc. came up with the cash -- but with a catch.
Enron owed Citigroup $250 million in unsecured debt that was coming due in early December, just one portion of the overall debt Enron owes the bank. So Citigroup told Enron it would provide $600 million of a new $1 billion secured loan -- as long as $250 million was used to pay back existing Citigroup debt, according to people familiar with the transaction. 
Now, a number of bankers in the lending syndicate are crying foul. Citigroup, they say, used its influence as a new secured lender to improve the standing of unsecured loans it had already extended at the expense of other lenders. The bankers say they discovered only later that part of the loan facility was used to prop a Citigroup debt position. Thus, the bankers are likely to challenge Citigroup's arrangement as part of Enron's bankruptcy filing in a New York bankruptcy court. 
Few can blame Citigroup for trying to reduce its exposure to Enron. But some analysts say the maneuver raises questions about whether Citigroup moved unfairly to grab assets. And the deal effectively reduced the pool of collateral available to all of Enron's other creditors in the bankruptcy proceedings. "There's a bit of a conflict there," says Andy Collins, an analyst with U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray. 
Citigroup declined to comment. 
At a minimum, the controversy over the Citigroup financing underscores how contentious Enron's bankruptcy process could become, as numerous creditors fight to secure a piece of a shrinking asset pie. It addition, it raises still more questions about the multiple hats worn by large lenders such as Citigroup, and the conflicts that may create with Enron's other creditors. 
For Enron, the demand was a disappointment. While Enron trumpeted $1 billion in fresh financing to the investing public, it actually received only $750 million in new money, less than it had wanted, according to several people involved in the financing. 
Enron Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey McMahon has been telling other creditors that Enron needed cash so badly that Enron had no choice but to go through with the deal. Mr. McMahon was unavailable to comment, but an Enron spokeswoman says, "We got the best deal we could at the time." The arrangement was driven by the fact that the $250 million debt in question, linked to financing for a natural-gas transaction, was soon to come due, according to a banker familiar with Citigroup's strategy. 
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., which contributed the remaining $400 million to the $1 billion credit line, also had hundreds of millions of dollars in existing unsecured exposure to Enron. Unlike Citigroup, it made no demands that its own existing loans be rolled into the new credit facility. An official at J.P. Morgan declined to comment. 
The incident sheds some light on the inner workings of Citigroup in the Enron mess. J.P. Morgan has disclosed it is owed some $2.6 billion in Enron-related exposure. 
But Citigroup has kept quiet on the subject. Analysts have said it was at least $1 billion, but warn the number could be higher. "Citigroup's disclosure has been lagging," says Mr. Collins. 
In most bankruptcy cases, unsecured creditors examine all loans extended before the filing to see whether the collateral was granted properly. If an unsecured debt was paid off, or turned into a secured debt, within 90 days of a bankruptcy, that lender is sometimes accused of receiving a "preference" over other lenders. 
Because such "preferences" clash with a basic aim of bankruptcy law -- to stop a race to the courthouse by treating all similarly situated creditors the same -- they can be challenged in court. 
A potential challenge by some creditors against Citigroup, in essence, would be that the bank improved its standing in the line of creditors by demanding new collateral on the $250 million of unsecured debt, thereby taking away from other creditors assets that might be available pro rata to other unsecured creditors. 
Such challenges are often mounted late in the bankruptcy process, when creditors are hashing out how to allocate assets that have been assigned to creditors. 
If the Citigroup financing is successfully challenged, the $250 million claim would once again become unsecured, freeing up the collateral for the potential pool of assets to be divvied up by unsecured creditors.

Enron, Argentina take down J.P. Morgan Chase earnings
By EILEEN ALT POWELL
AP Business Writer

Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

NEW YORK (AP) - Hammered by loans to Argentina and the bankrupt Enron Corp. that have gone bad, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. on Wednesday reported a steep earnings loss for the fourth quarter. The results were far below analysts' estimates. 
Bad news for the New York financial giant came in almost every division except retail, which was boosted by record mortgage originations and higher deposit volumes. Operating revenues declined in the fourth quarter in investment banking and in investment management and private banking, J.P. Morgan said. J.P. Morgan Partners, its venture capital arm, reported a loss.
William B. Harrison Jr., chairman and chief executive officer, said in a statement accompanying the earnings report, that results "were particularly affected by our exposure to private equity investments, and to Enron and Argentina." 
He said the bank had moved "aggressively to value those exposures to market and to build loan loss reserves further" to position the bank for stronger earnings when markets recover. 
The bank said it lost $332 million, or 18 cents a share, in the October-December period. A year earlier, it reported net income of $708 million, or 34 cents a share. 
Excluding merger and restructuring costs, the company earned $247 million, or 12 cents a share, for the quarter compared with $763 million, or 37 cents a share, a year earlier. 
Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call had expected operating earnings of 34 cents a share. 
The bank said its total nonperforming assets were $3.92 billion at year's end, including $1.13 billion "related to the Enron surety receivables and letter of credit." That, it said, was the "subject of litigation." Nonperforming assets a year earlier totaled $1.92 billion, the bank said. 
For the full year, net income was $1.69 billion, or 80 cents a share, compared with $5.73 billion, or $2.86 a share, in 2000. Operating earnings were $3.41 billion, or $1.65 a share, compared with $5.93 billion, or $2.96 a share, in 2000.

NEW YORK (AFX) - JP Morgan Chase & Co vice chairman Marc Shapiro said the bank's exposure to bankrupt energy giant Enron Corp totalled 450 mln usd in the fourth quarter. 
Shapiro made the comment in an interview with CNBC television, immediately after the bank reported fourth-quarter operating earnings per share of 12 cents, down from 37 cents a year ago and well below the First Call/Thomson Financial consensus of 34 cents.
JP Morgan Chase said Enron and its exposure to Argentina shaved a total of 807 mln usd off trading and other revenues.

FOCUS Analysts, ratings agencies image hurt by Enron; legal impact unlikely

01/16/2002
AFX News
(c) 2002 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

---- by Leslie Wines ---- 
NEW YORK (AFX) - Public trust in brokerage analysts and debt rating agencies will remain seriously eroded for months by their failure to issue timely warnings prior to Enron Corp's Dec 2, 2001 bankruptcy filing, but they face few legal and financial consequences, analysts said.
About 16 brokerage analysts maintained 'Buy" orders on Enron right up until Dec 2, according to Steven Toll, a partner with Washington, DC securities law firm Cohen, Milstein, Hausfield & Toll, which has filed a shareholders' class action case against Enron. 
Standard & Poor's Corp downgraded the debt of Enron Corp in late November, triggering the collapse of merger plans with Dynegy Inc and the bankruptcy filing. The downgrade came a full three months after the company first revealed its own problems. 
Toll said that the extremely late response of analysts was highly disturbing to countless investors who depend on them in large part for investment decision advice. 
But he said he has no plans to launch a class action suit against brokerages and ratings agencies on behalf of investors because such a case would have scant chances for success as these institutions do not have a legal fiduciary duty to warn stock buyers. 
"The problem is they (analysts and ratings agencies) are not paid by shareholders," Toll said. "They are paid by their employers and owe a duty to them. It would be very hard to show that they have a duty to everyone in the marketplace." 
In addition, a recent US Supreme Court ruling largely restricts fraud litigation to those suspected of committing it directly, such as, in this case, certain Enron executives and their auditors at Arthur Andersen LLP. 
Brokerage analysts, ratings agencies and other additional parties who may have "aided and abetted fraud" in the Enron case would not be easy to sue under the current US Supreme Court's legal interpretations, Toll said. 
However, an individual investor who sues his personal broker or analyst might have a better chance of success, he said. 
George Perry, a fellow with the Brookings Institute in Washington, DC, said: "This thing is going to upset a lot of people before it's over, but in general I don't think that the analysts will be in legal trouble." 
Margaret Blair, another Brookings Institute fellow and a Georgetown University School of Law professor, said the delayed response of brokerage analysts to the Enron developments intensified a public confidence crisis that began in 2000 when they failed to warn investors of the technology sector's impending sharp deterioration. 
"The analysts' reputation was already shot after they contrived to put out glowing reports on the internet sector well after the party was over," Blair said. 
In addition, she said some shrewd investors began to express reservations about the trustworthiness of analyst research even before the Nasdaq market began its decline. 
"Any time someone appears to be minting money, it's fishy. And it's the duty of analysts to ask tough questions. If they don't, people will lose respect," she said. 
"I think analysts will have to work harder than ever to show that they understand the companies they cover," Blair said. "It may be a long time before the public falls for what they have to say." 
By contrast, she said criticism of debt ratings agencies may be less severe because their function is chiefly to analyze the financial information provided to the general public by corporations, and in the Enron case this information itself was flawed and possibly fraudulent. 
"I'm not sure you can blame the ratings agencies for not having access to what went on at Enron," she said. 
However, J. Edward Ketz, an associate professor of accouning at Penn State's Smeal School of Business, said ratings agencies' delayed response to the Enron crisis is "a serious problem." 
"The problem of ratings agencies moving too late has been there for years," he said. "Ratings agencies generally make changes only after a problem is known by everyone." 
"I don't know how many investors know this, but some ratings agencies look at companies in depth only once every two to three years. The rest of the time they just take cursory looks at the listed companies once in a while." 
Ketz said that in some cases investors with a knowledge of statistical models would be better off taking quarterly corporate financial statements and making their own assessments of profits performances. 
He also said that brokerage analysts' usefulness to investors has been gradually weakened in recent years by a shift in analysts' approach to their own roles. 
"In the past analysts looked at financial statements and other information and tried to come up with an independent objective view," he said. "But now they seem closer to marketing firms for the companies they cover," Ketz said.

`Lockdowns' of 401(k) Plans Draw Scrutiny --- Enron Employees' Losses Suddenly Put Practice in Spotlight
By Ellen E. Schultz
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

Many investors now are painfully aware that "lockdowns" don't just occur in prisons -- they can handcuff employees' retirement-savings plans, too. 
And for that disclosure, they can thank Enron Corp.
Last fall, amid the growing news of financial woes at the energy-trading company, Enron officials "locked down" the employee retirement-savings plan to make administrative changes. Although long-planned, the lockdown was poorly timed: It prevented employees from moving out of Enron stock as its price continued to plummet. 
The recent disclosures that Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay and top aides were aware of significant troubles at the company two months before the lockdown -- yet went ahead with it anyway -- have magnified the wrath of employees who have lost millions of dollars in retirement savings. 
It also has hastened the examination of lockdowns by investigators. In addition to a Labor Department investigation, Sen. Charles Grassley (R., Iowa), a ranking member of the Finance Committee, says his staff is examining lockdowns, which also are known as "blackouts" and "quiet periods." 
The latest developments also signal the possibility for "potential criminal exposure," asserts Marc Machiz, former associate solicitor at the Labor Department in the Plan Benefits Security division. He adds that the lockdown by itself isn't the main issue. "If the company deceived employees into hanging onto the stock, it could become part of a pattern of fraud that might support" a racketeering claim, contends Mr. Machiz, now a member of the Washington law firm Cohen, Milstein, Hausfeld, & Toll, who isn't involved in the Enron litigation. 
Robert F. Bennett, a lawyer for Enron, at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher, & Flom, says, "We are not aware of any criminal conduct in any fashion related to the 401(k), and people should not make reckless allegations in this area." 
Lockdowns, though unpopular with employees, hadn't been controversial before now. They are the equivalent of putting a car up on the blocks when it is getting a tune-up. They occur when a plan is being transferred to a new recordkeeper, or is implementing some structural change, such as a shift to daily valuation from monthly valuation. During this time, employers forbid employees from moving their savings among funds. 
Ordinarily, such lockdowns are perfectly legal and routine. But if company officials know that a coming lockdown will coincide with grim news that could send the stock lower -- falling earnings, lawsuits, layoffs, a regulatory investigation -- then as fiduciaries they have a responsibility to protect employees in the plan. Postponing a lockdown would be a prudent move. 
Companies typically alert employees months in advance to planned lockdowns to give them time to shift their investments around if they choose. Normally, a "time out" of several weeks or even a couple of months may not make that much difference to employee savings, as long as the market isn't roiled by some disaster. 
However, the growing prominence of employer stock in retirement plans has made lockdowns riskier for workers. As more and more employees hold huge positions in their employers' stock, they face enhanced risks when they are forced to sit tight for a period of time. As Enron has shown, they can't bail out to limit their losses. (That's assuming they are allowed to sell: Most companies prevent employees from selling shares they receive from the company until a certain age. Enron employees under age 50 weren't allowed to diversify out of company-contributed stock, so even without the lockdown, they were locked into those shares). 
Conversely, during lockdowns, employees can't sell to lock in gains either. International Paper Inc. locked down its 401(k) plan, which had 43% of its assets in company stock, from Nov. 30, 1999, through Jan. 31, 2000. During that time, the company's stock fell 9% to $47.63. 
The company in prior months had notified employees of the coming "quiet period," which occurred while the company made improvements to the plan. Thomas Johnson, a manager with the company for 38 years who was planning to retire the following summer, planned to sell his shares when the stock was in the $50 range to diversify. 
Although the shares hit a high of $60 during the lockdown, Mr. Johnson couldn't make a move. In contrast, filings show that IP insiders sold millions of dollars in shares during the period when the employees were locked down. 
Unlike Enron employees, Mr. Johnson didn't see his savings evaporate. But his situation raises questions about whether employees close to retirement are more at risk in lockdowns. A spokesman for IP says that the company communicated the planned lockdown for many months ahead of time and that the changes improved employees' ability to diversify. 
If nothing else, Enron's lockdown will lead to closer scrutiny of how well companies communicate these events. Some Enron employees allege that the company sent them an e-mail on Sept. 27 erroneously stating that the lockdown would start Oct. 19, though it didn't start until Oct. 26. As a result, they missed an opportunity to sell the stock when it was selling for almost $30 a share, they say. On Oct. 26, the last day employees could trade their accounts, the stock closed at $15.40 a share; by the end of the lockdown on Nov. 13, it had fallen to $9.98. 
An Enron spokesman says that the company sent out a brochure and additional e-mails throughout October, and that this apparently got the message across, because on the last trading day before the lockdown, Oct. 26, 187 employee investment transfers were made. 
In an e-mail the company sent to employees shortly before midnight of the final day to make transfers, the company acknowledged that employees wanted to postpone the lockdown, but said it was going ahead anyway. 
"We understand that you are concerned about the timing" of the lockdown and "we understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total, or your account in particular," the e-mail said. "Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals."

Computer sleuths searching for deleted Enron e-mails

WASHINGTON (AP) - The job of recovering the missing Enron Corp. accounting documents is falling to computer sleuths whose work can foil the casual use of the delete button. 
They've been called on before in high-profile cases, looking for suspected spy transmissions and missing Clinton White House e-mails.
And now they'll be asked to recover documents from the computers of Arthur Andersen LLP, which acknowledges its employees destroyed thousands of e-mails and paper documents about Enron. 
Investigators want to know who knew about the problems at Enron, which shocked the financial world and its own employees with its fall from Wall Street grace to bankruptcy. 
Computer sleuths move quickly to preserve hard drives and backup tapes before the bits of deleted data are overwritten forever. 
Andersen has said its Houston auditors started deleting Enron e-mails on Oct. 23 and stopped Nov. 9. Bedser said his firm has been able to recover Lotus Notes e-mail messages that were deleted up to eight months earlier. Andersen used Lotus Notes. 
Most computer users think a simple stroke of the delete key is enough to make a message disappear forever.

Enron faces Congress probe over its own tax returns 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Even as it neared collapse, Enron Corp. was in the forefront of a business lobbying campaign to scrap the corporate alternative minimum tax. Now, Congress is turning its attention to Enron's own tax returns. 
Repeal of the alternative minimum tax was backed by dozens of companies including Enron and was part of President Bush's economic stimulus plan. The House added a provision that would have given Enron a $254 million infusion of cash, but the package ultimately failed. 
Now, the Senate Finance Committee is "interested in whether Enron has been complying with federal tax laws" particularly those governing tax shelters, said the panel's spokesman, Mike Siegel. 
Whether Enron used any shelters viewed by the Internal Revenue Service as set up mainly to avoid paying taxes is one key point. 
Enron, the Houston-based energy conglomerate, faces investigations from a growing list of congressional committees, the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission following its collapse late last year in the nation's biggest corporate bankruptcy. The Finance Committee is one of two congressional panels with access to Enron's tax records. 
Even as its failure loomed last fall, Enron maintained a high-profile lobbying effort on a variety of tax issues. Enron led the AMT Coalition for Economic Growth, a business group dedicated to repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax, which is intended to guarantee that companies pay at least a minimal amount of income taxes. 
Bush also pushed for repeal in his economic stimulus package, arguing that the provision hits corporations hardest in down years.

Paper Trail: Andersen Fires Partner It Says Led Shredding Of Enron Documents --- It Claims Disposal Effort Started After SEC Asked Energy Firm for Data --- Was He Following Orders?
By Wall Street Journal staff reporters Ken Brown, Greg Hitt, Steve Liesman and Jonathan Weil

Capping a series of stunning disclosures, Arthur Andersen LLP fired a partner it charged with directing the hurried destruction of thousands of e-mails and paper documents related to its audit of troubled Enron Corp., declaring that he acted after learning that federal regulators were probing the energy giant's finances. 
In an extraordinary statement, Andersen said David Duncan -- the Houston-based lead partner on the Enron account -- led "an expedited effort to destroy documents" after he learned "that Enron had received a request for information from the SEC about its financial accounting and reporting." In addition to firing Mr. Duncan, Andersen placed three other Houston partners responsible for the Enron audit on administrative leave.
The purge marked an effort by Andersen to contain the Enron affair to its Houston office and shield itself from more serious charges, as Congress and the Justice Department intensify their scrutiny of the case. "If they can show that this was a rogue partner, acting beyond his authority, that will help them fashion a defense," said Joseph di Genova, a former U.S. attorney in Washington, D.C., who isn't involved in the case. 
Just what more senior officials at Andersen knew, and when they knew it, will become central questions, as the embattled firm struggles to salvage its tattered reputation and credibility, and to limit its possible civil and criminal liability. 
While Andersen insisted that its higher-ups didn't know until recently about the destruction of documents, a person close to Mr. Duncan and speaking on his behalf said the firm is unjustly trying to pin the blame on him. Mr. Duncan merely was following instructions in an Oct. 12 e-mail from an Andersen lawyer that advised the Enron auditors to follow company procedure that allows for the disposal of many documents, this person said. Congressional and Justice Department investigators expect to question Mr. Duncan in Washington, D.C., today. 
Separately, even as Andersen moved to contain the damage to its Houston office, there were new indications yesterday that Andersen's Chicago headquarters knew details about controversial Enron financing arrangements that contributed to the company's downfall. These arrangements included partnerships that kept huge amounts of debt off the company's balance sheet and inflated earnings. 
After investigating an Enron employee's warnings in August about improper accounting for the partnerships, the company's outside law firm, Vinson & Elkins, wrote in a report to Enron that "all material facts" about the partnerships were "disclosed and reviewed by Arthur Andersen." The Oct. 15, 2001, report, a copy of which was obtained by The Wall Street Journal, said that Andersen officials in Houston consulted with colleagues in Chicago about the accounting treatment of the partnerships. The nine-page report made clear that Enron's board of directors approved of the outside partnerships and had suspended its code of ethics to allow the partnerships to be headed by a top Enron executive who stood to benefit financially from them. 
Asked for comment on the Vinson & Elkins report, an Andersen spokesman yesterday would only refer to the recent congressional testimony of Andersen Chief Executive Joseph Berardino. Mr. Berardino told lawmakers that in one case, Andersen made an error in judgment in accepting Enron's accounting for one of its off-balance-sheet financing vehicles. In another case, he said that if Andersen had known everything about the deal it wouldn't have signed off on it. 
Deepening financial problems related to its hidden debt and overstated earnings forced Enron in December to become the biggest company ever to file for bankruptcy-court protection. Its collapse has been painful to investors, and especially Enron employees, who have seen once-valuable company stock become almost worthless. In recent weeks, attention increasingly has focused on Andersen's failure to flag the giant energy-trading company's problems in audits and on Enron's unsuccessful efforts to use its influence in Washington to keep the company from going under. 
The scandal widened last Thursday with the disclosure by Andersen, initially with few details, of the document destruction. On Monday, congressional officials revealed a letter written by an Enron employee last August, expressing worry that the company would "implode in a wave of accounting scandals." It also emerged Monday that Vinson & Elkins, in its Oct. 15 report, had concluded that nothing wrong had gone on at its client, Enron. 
In its announcement yesterday, Andersen depicted a frantic effort last October, allegedly directed by Mr. Duncan in its Houston office, to get rid of sensitive documents. The disposal took place as troubles mounted at Enron and after questions arose about accounting deficiencies that may have contributed to the company's downfall. 
Andersen said in its statement: "The effort [to destroy documents] was initiated following an urgent meeting the lead partner called on Oct. 23 to organize the expedited effort to dispose of Enron-related documents. This meeting occurred shortly after the lead partner learned that Enron had received a request for information from the [Securities and Exchange Commission] about its financial accounting and reporting. This effort was undertaken without any consultation with others in the firm and at a time when the engagement team should have had serious questions about their actions. Nothing in an Oct. 12 e-mail, almost two weeks earlier, or so far as we know, other conversations around that time, authorized this activity." 
The firm added that the document destruction "appears to have ended shortly after the lead partner's assistant sent an e-mail to other secretaries on Nov. 9 -- the day after Andersen received a subpoena from the SEC -- telling them to `stop the shredding.' " By that time, huge volumes of e-mails and written documents had been destroyed. Andersen said, "These activities were on such a scale and of such a nature as to remove any doubt that Andersen's policies and reasonable good judgment were violated." 
Andersen said that it couldn't assure that document destruction ended after the firm officially came under scrutiny in the SEC investigation. "The firm is still looking into this issue," Andersen said, noting that "if anyone is found to have acted in this way, they will be dismissed." 
The Andersen spokesman wouldn't comment yesterday on whether people in any office other than Houston knew about the document shredding as it was happening. 
Andersen's Mr. Berardino said in a brief interview that he first learned of the document destruction on Jan. 3 and that the firm notified the Justice Department and the SEC the following day. "We came out with this as soon as we had enough facts," he said. It is "too early to say" what the debacle's impact will be on Andersen's ability to attract new clients, he added. In an advertisement appearing in today's Wall Street Journal, Mr. Berardino said, "In the near future Andersen will announce comprehensive changes in our practices and policies that we believe will reaffirm confidence in the independence and quality of our work." 
A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment on the latest revelations from Andersen. But Mr. di Genova, the former federal prosecutor, predicted that the accounting firm's fast action signals it may seek to cooperate with the government's criminal investigation. 
"If prosecutors can cut a deal with Arthur Andersen, they may be able to get to the bottom of what happened at Enron pretty quickly," said Mr. di Genova, who is now a private white-collar defense lawyer. The purge and admission about document shredding amount to "a really nice piece of evidence [for prosecutors]," he said. If it can be shown that anyone at Andersen destroyed documents "in the middle of a criminal or congressional investigation," that person could be charged with obstruction of justice, a crime punishable by prison time, he said. 
On Capitol Hill, the investigation by the House Energy and Commerce Committee, led by Republican Chairman W.J. "Billy" Tauzin, is accelerating rapidly. Boxes of documents are pouring into the panel's office from Enron and Andersen. Committee aides are preparing for a series of imminent interviews with central players in the financial drama. 
Mr. Duncan is scheduled to be interviewed today by investigators from the committee, as well as by officials with the Justice Department, congressional aides said. "Now that he's been fired he may have a little more motivation to cooperate with us," said Mr. Tauzin's spokesman, Ken Johnson. "Today, we heard one side of the story. Tomorrow we'll hear the other." 
The firing and other actions by Andersen mirror classic strategy in white-collar criminal-defense cases: Hand prosecutors a few scalps and pledge cooperation in hopes of gaining lenient treatment in the future. Securities-law specialists say it's likely only the beginning of a wave of acts of contrition by Andersen in an attempt to restore its reputation and appease authorities. 
In its prepared statement, Andersen took care to cite the document destruction as the only reason that Mr. Duncan and the other partners were being fired or placed on leave. The firm didn't link Enron's audit failure to the personnel actions. In past cases of audit failures, such as those involving Waste Management Inc. and Sunbeam Corp., Andersen chose not to fire the partners responsible for those companies' audits, partly out of concern that they would turn against the firm in subsequent litigation. 
Taking action against employees doesn't necessarily shield Andersen from being criminally prosecuted itself, Ted Fiflis, a securities-law professor at the University of Colorado at Boulder, said. 
Andersen's Houston office has been one of its biggest and most successful, employing more than 1,400 people, out of Andersen's world-wide work force of 85,000. The firm said it has the largest operation of any of the Big Five accounting firms in Houston, even though it is the smallest of the Big Five overall. 
Mr. Duncan, 42 years old, has been at the firm since 1981, except for a nine-month period in 1992, and was made partner in 1995. He has been the Enron "engagement partner" since 1997, and over the past three years has taken on broader responsibility within Andersen, people close to him said. In 1999 and 2000, he was part of a firm-wide strategic advisory council and last year, Mr. Berardino asked him to be on the chairman's advisory council, a group of 21 partners who discuss firm-wide issues. He was informed of his dismissal in a phone call yesterday morning, the people close to him said. 
These people said that no Enron documents had been destroyed before Houston officials received the e-mail from an Andersen lawyer on Oct. 12. That long and detailed policy statement, while ordering auditors to save crucial documents, told them to destroy many other documents. If the firm wanted the auditors to save all the Enron-related documents, it should have sent a different memo, a person close to Mr. Duncan said. 
"When you want to preserve documents, you say it with bold-faced letters with exclamation points," this person added. "The notion that there was some kind of instruction from him that there be some form of expedited, extraordinary activity, it's just not correct," the person close to Mr. Duncan said. Mr. Duncan is cooperating fully with government investigators, according to the people close to him. 
The Houston-based Andersen partners put on administrative leave for their roles in the Enron document destruction are Thomas H. Bauer, Debra A. Cash and Roger D. Willard. Peter Anderson, an attorney for Mr. Willard, denied that his client had been involved in any wrongdoing. Andersen's "action suggests that my client has done something wrong or had acted in violation of the firm's policy, and we have no evidence . . . that has been communicated to us or that we're even aware of that would suggest that that's the case," he said. 
Mr. Anderson said he was told by attorneys for Andersen that the leaves were imposed "out of an abundance of caution." The attorney added that his client, Mr. Willard, "acted in a belief that he was acting in accordance with Andersen policy." 
Mr. Bauer and Ms. Cash didn't return phone calls to their homes and offices. 
The firm also relieved four Houston-based partners of their management responsibilities. They are D. Stephen Goddard Jr., Michael M. Lowther, Gary B. Goolsby and Michael C. Odom. None of the four returned calls to their homes and offices. 
Even as attention yesterday was focused on the document destruction, investigators continue to probe the controversial aspects of Enron's accounting. One of the central questions has been how much Andersen -- and in particular top-level partners -- knew about certain partnerships, including some run by Enron's officers. One of the partnerships, whose existence Enron didn't disclose for four years, was part of an arrangement that inflated earnings by several hundred million dollars. And Enron's debt level was much higher than it revealed, thanks to the off-balance-sheet treatment. 
Andersen partners were apparently concerned enough about the structure of these deals that they "consulted with its senior technical experts in its Chicago office," according to the report to Enron from Vinson & Elkins, the outside law firm. 
The report also suggested ongoing contact between Enron and Andersen over the partnerships. "The relationship between Enron and AA was an open one," the report said, citing Enron's chief accounting officer, Richard Causey, a former Andersen employee. "Enron consults AA early and often on accounting and audit issues as they arise." 
On more than one occasion, Mr. Causey told other company officials that Andersen's Houston office took decisions about the accounting treatment of the partnerships to the accounting firm's top levels in Chicago, an Enron insider said in an interview. "Duncan would run these things way up the chain," this person said. The company insider didn't know who specifically in Andersen's Chicago headquarters received the information. 
Asked about whether Andersen's Houston office routinely sought approval from the Chicago headquarters in this manner, an Enron spokeswoman said, "We were aware that in many cases the Houston office of Andersen consulted with the national office on the accounting treatment of various partnerships." 
While many big companies have close relationships with their outside auditors, the relationship between Enron and Andersen was particularly close. In 1993, when Andersen took over Enron's internal-audit operation, 40 people moved from the company's payroll to Andersen's. Andersen employees occupied a large space in Enron's office tower. 
Mr. Duncan, the Andersen audit partner, was a frequent golfing partner of Mr. Causey, the chief accounting officer for Enron. And Mr. Duncan also moved in some of the same philanthropic circles as Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive. The two men both serve on the 36-member board of directors of a nonprofit organization called the American Council for Capital Formation, according to the council's Web site. The organization says its mission is to promote "economic growth through sound tax, regulatory, and environmental policies."

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: NEWS ANALYSIS
For Andersen and Enron, the Questions Just Keep Coming
By FLOYD NORRIS

The New York Times

c. 2002 New York Times Company

Arthur Andersen tried yesterday to salvage its reputation by firing a partner who it said had directed the destruction of Enron documents. But the actions it said the partner took have left Andersen facing the likelihood of criminal investigations even as it tries to reassure the public, and its clients, that its audits can be trusted. 
''This is very, very bad,'' said Alan M. Cohen, a former federal prosecutor in New York and now a partner at the law firm of O'Melveny & Myers. ''There is little doubt that prosecutors will view this as an act of obstruction. It is inconceivable to me that the partner and Andersen would not be subjects of a criminal investigation at a minimum.''
He noted that even though Andersen says the destruction was not authorized by the firm, the law says a business has ''vicarious liability'' for acts committed by its agents or employees. 
Paul R. Brown, the chairman of the accounting department at the Stern School of Business of New York University, said of Andersen: ''They have taken a permanent hit to their reputation.'' 
Joseph F. Berardino, Andersen's managing partner and chief executive, tried to put the best face on the situation as he announced the firing. ''Based on our actions today, it should be perfectly clear that Andersen will not tolerate unethical behavior, gross errors in judgment or willful violation of our policies,'' he said. 
Only a month ago, Mr. Berardino said the Enron case showed that reforms were needed in accounting rules, and he blamed Enron management for deceiving his auditors. But now the focus is clearly on Andersen itself. 
''The integrity of this firm is in question,'' Mr. Berardino said in a telephone interview. ''Our reputation is our most important asset.'' 
David Ruder, a former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission who is now a professor of law at Northwestern University, said Andersen was ''doing what they can to repair the damage by firing the person and changing the management down there.'' But he said the firm should also undertake a broad review of its entire internal enforcement procedures to make sure its auditors will walk away from a client when necessary. 
Andersen said the fired partner, David B. Duncan, ordered the destruction of documents the day after Enron said the S.E.C. was asking questions about the financial statements that Andersen had audited. 
Just what was in the destroyed documents is not known. Nor is it clear what, if anything, was wrong with the audits of Enron that Mr. Duncan had supervised since 1997. But prosecutors assume that a person with nothing to hide does not destroy documents after an investigation has been disclosed. 
''The destruction of documents would indicate some intent to deceive,'' said Franklin B. Velie, a former federal prosecutor who is now a partner at the Salans law firm in New York. ''Where there's smoke there's fire, and where there is a lot of smoke, like the destruction of documents, there is a lot of fire. This is really beginning to look like a fraud scenario.'' 
Andersen's reputation was hurt last year when the S.E.C. filed a civil fraud case against the firm concerning its audit of Waste Management. It was the first such charge in decades against a major accounting firm, and the allegations reached to the very top of the firm. 
The S.E.C. said Richard L. Measelle, when he was the firm's managing partner, had concurred in the decision not to force Waste Management to correct faulty accounting that Andersen's auditors had uncovered. Mr. Measelle was not accused of wrongdoing. 
Andersen settled the case without admitting or denying wrongdoing and paid a $7 million fine. Two partners were fined and banned by the S.E.C. from auditing public companies for three years but kept their jobs. 
Why was no one fired then? ''You need to be fair to people who are trying to do a good job,'' Mr. Berardino said yesterday. 
Formal documents accepting an S.E.C. censure in the Waste Management case were signed by Gary B. Goolsby, then Andersen's director of global risk management. Yesterday he was one of four partners relieved of management duties in Andersen's Houston office. 
A lawyer for Mr. Duncan, the Andersen partner who was fired yesterday, said his client had done nothing wrong but was just following directives on document retention and destruction that had been sent to Houston by a lawyer at Andersen's Chicago headquarters on Oct. 12. Andersen says nothing in those directives would have justified Mr. Duncan's actions. 
The directives encourage the destruction of documents that are not needed as work papers to support an audit. They say that all documents should be retained if there is a threat of litigation. But they do not say explicitly whether that would apply when the S.E.C. has started an informal investigation of a client, like Enron disclosed on Oct. 22, or even when the investigation has become a formal one, as Enron disclosed on Oct. 29. But lawyers not involved in this case say it is clear that documents should be preserved after an accounting firm learns of an official investigation. 
The case against Andersen regarding Waste Management was based almost entirely on internal Andersen documents indicating that Andersen believed that Waste Management's accounting was improper but approved it anyway. Many of those documents need not have been maintained under the current Andersen policy. 
The official listed as the author of Andersen's directives on document retention was Robert V. Kutsenda, the firm's director of global risk management when the directives were issued in February 2000, while the Waste Management investigation was under way. He retired from Andersen last year after the S.E.C. said he had ''engaged in highly unreasonable conduct'' in the Waste Management case. The S.E.C. barred him from auditing public companies for a year. 
Andersen said yesterday that Mr. Duncan had directed ''the deletion of thousands of e-mails and the rushed disposal of large numbers of paper documents.'' It said the ''activities were on such a scale as to remove any doubt that Andersen's policies and reasonable good judgment were violated.'' 
But if it was that clear that Andersen's policies were being violated, it does not appear that any of the Houston personnel involved in the activities complained to their superiors at the Chicago headquarters. Mr. Berardino said yesterday that he did not hear anything about the document destruction until Jan. 3. 
That could indicate that to some at Andersen, the lesson learned from the Waste Management case was not the lesson that the S.E.C. wanted to send -- that auditors run great risks if they sign off on accounts they know to be wrong. Instead, they may have concluded that the error was in keeping the documents around for the S.E.C. to subpoena them later. 
The services of an accounting firm are of no use to a company if investors will not trust the auditor's report. That is clearly a risk Andersen faces, even if it manages to avoid charges. 
But Andersen may be helped by the fact that there are now only five major accounting firms, a number reduced from eight by mergers in recent years. The companies that hire auditors do not want to see even less competition. 
For most companies that report on a calendar-year basis, audits for 2001 are under way, and changing an auditor would be extremely difficult. But changing after that audit is completed would be far easier. It is then that it may become clear how badly Andersen has been damaged.

Andersen Dismisses Lead Enron Auditor; Partner Said to Lead Document Shredding

Accounting giant Arthur Andersen yesterday fired the partner who ran its audits of Enron Corp., saying he had directed a "rushed" destruction of documents after learning that federal regulators were beginning to look into Enron's books. 
The document destruction didn't stop, Andersen said, until the partner's assistant sent a "stop the shredding" e-mail in November, the day after Andersen received a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The big accounting firm also placed three other partners on administrative leave and demoted four managers in its Houston office, where Enron and its auditors are based. "The message we're delivering today -- highly unusual -- is we are not going to tolerate anything less than the highest standards," Andersen chief executive Joseph F. Berardino said in an interview. 
The dismissal of David B. Duncan came less than a week after the accounting firm disclosed that thousands of e-mails and a large number of paper documents related to the Enron audit had been destroyed. "These activities were on such a scale and of such a nature as to remove any doubt that Andersen's policies and reasonable good judgment were violated," Andersen said. 
Andersen has not described the content of the lost records. The firm said the shredding was undertaken "without any consultation with others in the firm and at a time when the [Enron] engagement team should have had serious questions about their actions." 
Enron's collapse is being investigated by the Justice Department, the SEC and several congressional committees, and the revelations of document destruction have fueled questions about Andersen's role as well. 
Enron, which filed for bankruptcy protection in December and whose stock was dropped by the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, disclosed in November that it had overstated its annual profits by nearly $600 million and had improperly kept more than $1 billion in debt off its books since 1997. Andersen had endorsed Enron's financial statements. 
Duncan, the fired partner at Andersen, met Monday with lawyers from the Justice Department and the SEC, according to sources close to the probe. Duncan, who reported to executives in Houston and at Andersen's Chicago headquarters, is scheduled to meet with House Energy and Commerce Committee investigators today. 
"Mr. Duncan is cooperating with all investigations of this matter. He properly followed the instructions of an Andersen in-house lawyer in handling documents," said a lawyer for Sullivan and Cromwell, which is representing Duncan. He declined to say what information was contained in the documents and e-mails but stressed that work papers from the audit were not destroyed. 
Work papers document the final conclusions auditors reach, among other things. They would not necessarily include many records of potential use to investigators, such as notes, early drafts of papers, client records, messages between auditors or correspondence with clients. 
Andersen policy generally calls for work papers to be kept for six years, and it prohibits the destruction of any "related information" in cases of "threatened litigation." 
Under federal law, it is a felony to "corruptly" persuade another person to destroy records with an intent to impair their "availability for use in an official proceeding." The law says the proceeding "need not be pending or about to be instituted at the time of the offense." 
As Andersen's problems multiplied, more details came to light about the allegations that an Enron insider made about the company's financial practices last summer. 
The full text of the letter Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay received in August from Enron Vice President Sherron Watkins, warning that the company might "implode in a wave of accounting scandals," was released yesterday by the House committee. Separately, Robert S. Bennett, a Washington attorney for Enron, released the findings of an investigation of Watkins's charges by the company's outside law firm, Vinson & Elkins. 
Her accusations are at the center of the probes of Enron, which are seeking to determine whether company officials concealed a deteriorating financial condition from investors and employees -- a charge Enron has denied. Watkins did not sign the letter but then identified herself to Lay and met with him about her concerns. 
In the letter, she alleged: 
* Lay should choose someone other than Andersen and Vinson & Elkins to investigate her allegations because both were involved in approving some of the transactions she complained about. Lay chose instead to have the company's outside law firm conduct a limited investigation without "second-guessing" the accounting practices. 
* Other senior Enron executives challenged then-chief executive Jeffrey Skilling about conflicts of interest in the operations of partnerships the energy-trading company set up with its chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. Jeffrey McMahon, then Enron's treasurer, was "highly vexed" about the conflicts, "complained mightily" and suggested a list of remedies. 
* She knew that a lot of accountants, including Andersen, "have blessed the accounting treatment [used by the partnerships in question]. None of that will protect Enron if these transactions are ever disclosed in the bright light of day." 
* Enron had failed to describe its partnership obligations adequately in its financial statements. If the partnerships had been fully explained, investors would have seen that Enron was exposed to hundreds of millions of dollars of potential losses. 
"My 8 years of Enron work history will be worth nothing on my resume, [and] the business world will consider the past successes as nothing but an elaborate accounting hoax," Watkins wrote. 
In Vinson & Elkins's Oct. 15 report on the letter's charges, the law firm said the disputed partnerships had been established with the approval of Enron's board and its audit committee. 
In its report, Vinson & Elkins said Enron and Andersen acknowledged that the accounting treatment of the partnerships "is creative and aggressive" but said that "no one has reason to believe it is inappropriate from a technical standpoint." 
After interviewing Andersen auditors, Vinson & Elkins reported that Andersen "is comfortable" with the explanations provided to investors in Enron's financial statements. Vinson added that it was Enron's practice to give the law firm "a relatively short time" to review the key financial information that Enron was disclosing in those statements. 
Under a "Bad Potential Cosmetics" heading, Vinson & Elkins said that partnership transactions cited by Watkins "could be portrayed very poorly" in a newspaper expose{acute} or a lawsuit by shareholders. "It could be argued" the transactions were questionable because Enron had underwritten the risks of partnership investors, the law firm said. 
Vinson & Elkins concluded that the facts it found did not warrant "a further widespread investigation" by independent lawyers and auditors. 
Enron attorney Bennett said Lay was not aware of the issues Watkins raised until he received the memo. Lay had told his general counsel "to get to the bottom" of Watkins's charges, Bennett said. "The notion that this was a whitewash is not borne out. . . . It was mostly an appearance problem," he said. 
The document destruction Andersen described yesterday makes its position in civil litigation "close to indefensible," said John C. Coffee Jr., a law professor at Columbia University. It is likely the firm will face "heavy liability," he said. 
"Whether or not this is a crime, it's a colossal blunder," Coffee said. 
The accounting firm has disclosed that Nancy Temple, a senior Andersen lawyer, had sent an Oct. 12 internal memo to remind the Enron audit team of the firm's document retention and destruction policy. 
In its statement yesterday, Andersen said Duncan called an "urgent meeting" on Oct. 23 to organize the destruction of Enron-related records, soon after Duncan learned that the SEC had asked Enron for information about its accounting. 
Andersen spokesman David Tabolt couldn't say yesterday why Temple did not act to preserve documents as soon as the firm learned of the SEC's inquiry Oct. 22. In its statement, Andersen said that "nothing in [her] Oct. 12 e-mail . . . or so far as we know other conversations around that time, authorized this activity." 
"There is a lot we don't know about what people did and didn't do," Tabolt said in an interview. 
As Andersen described the timing, the destruction of records continued after Enron disclosed on Oct. 31 that the SEC's preliminary inquiry had become a formal investigation. 
In the interview, Berardino said he was not aware of any records being destroyed after Andersen received an SEC subpoena on Nov. 8. But he added that he could not rule out the possibility. 
Duncan joined the company in 1981, became a partner in 1995 and was put in charge of the Enron account in 1997. 
Andersen said it placed on administrative leave partners Thomas H. Bauer, Debra A. Cash and Roger D. Willard and it relieved four others of management responsibilities: D. Stephen Goddard Jr., Michael M. Lowther, Gary B. Goolsby and Michael C. Odom. 
Odom declined to comment yesterday. Calls to the others were not returned.

Scandals Put Andersen's Future at Risk; Enron Case Is Just Latest to Put Dent in Reputation of Big Five Accounting Firm

On Vault.com, graduating college seniors who have been offered jobs at accounting giant Arthur Andersen ask plaintively into the ether whether they should still go. 
Some e-mail responders tout the company's history and tradition of excellence. Others volunteer that they're Andersen employees -- and say they're looking to get out.
Several large Andersen clients, such as Marriott International Inc., say they remain committed to Andersen. But many others won't say, and the cities of Seattle and Chicago are reconsidering their longtime links to the firm, according to the Chicago Tribune. 
The firm's admission that it destroyed subpoenaed documents from its audit of failed energy trader Enron Corp. is just the latest serious blow for the 89-year-old firm, founded by Arthur Andersen in 1913, which has prided itself for decades on its stolid, Midwestern sense of propriety and diligent, rigid accounting standards. 
University of Chicago accounting professor Roman L. Weil puts the company's odds of survival at only "50-50." He said the company could end up being harshly disciplined by the Securities and Exchange Commission; could be merged into another firm, perhaps one of the other Big Five accounting firms; or could go bankrupt if scandal-averse clients turn tail and sever their ties to the firm. 
"Their future is at risk, and there are many factors for that," said Arthur Bowman, editor of Atlanta-based Bowman's Accounting Reports. "The most obvious is financial. Defending the company will be expensive, even if they don't pay out a dime. There will be many, many lawsuits." 
"Arthur is rolling in his grave as we speak," Bowman said. "This company, with its great history, its great legacy. People would have said it was the most arrogant firm in the business, but they wouldn't say that today." 
Andersen is one of the the Washington region's largest corporate contributors to charities. Last year, it gave more than $1 million to local charities, and it permitted its employees to spend many hours engaged in volunteer work for nonprofit organizations. 
Andersen employees here, in Texas and around the country have been devastated by the company's internal problems, Bowman said. The firm's partners, who have been earning on average about $500,000 a year, are expected to soon be asked to help foot the bill for the company's defense. They are facing difficult choices about whether to stay or leave. 
Andersen announced yesterday that it would dismiss the lead partner on the Enron account and place three others on administrative leave. It also said it is putting new management in charge of the Houston office, where the auditing and accounting work for the now-bankrupt energy firm was headquartered. 
Andersen said it would also take action against anyone found to have purposefully deleted Enron-related e-mails or letters, as congressional investigators have alleged occurred. The firm said it is continuing to investigate the matter, and other employees found to have been involved will also be fired. 
"Based on our actions today, it should be perfectly clear that Andersen will not tolerate unethical behavior, gross errors in judgment or willful violation of our policies," said Joseph F. Berardino, Andersen's managing partner and chief executive. 
Arthur Andersen had prospered through the 1990s, enjoying double-digit income growth annually through the 1990s. Its revenue rose from $3 billion in 1992 to $9.3 billion in 2001, fueled by the firm's entry into new lines of business outside of its auditing. It now has 85,000 employees worldwide. 
One source of income growth came from outsourcing. The firm took over the internal accounting functions within many companies, including Enron, allowing those firms to focus on their businesses and reduce their payrolls and expenses. It was an especially easy transition if Andersen was also already handling the firms' auditing work. 
Also, about a decade ago, the firm's accounting arm began offering consulting services, including management advice and information technology assistance, to some longtime clients -- a practice that later had dire consequences on the management level as the firm's consulting wing vehemently protested the incursion into its home turf. 
With that, the baby boomers who headed the firm's consulting and accounting divisions, Jim Wadia and George Shaheen, began a divisive ground war among themselves, in a dispute so extended that some observers at the time likened it to Vietnam. The consulting arm took the matter to an international arbitrator to decide how best to split the two groups apart, resulting in a prolonged bout of negative publicity about the leadership turmoil -- an unattractive prospect for organizations that sold themselves on the basis of their management expertise. 
"It was pretty ugly," Bowman recalled. "They hated each other. It affected their every breathing moment they were consumed by it." 
The arbitrator partitioned the two firms into separate entities in July 2000. The accounting arm, which had hoped to receive a multibillion-dollar windfall from the consulting arm for the value of the brand name, was disappointed to receive far less. Andersen Consulting dubbed itself Accenture, and Arthur Andersen, the accounting arm, now often drops the "Arthur." 
Wadia resigned and then went to an international law firm called Linklaters in October 2001; Shaheen went to Webvan, an online grocery that has since failed. Other prominent executives left soon afterward. 
Last year, Andersen was forced to pay $110 million to settle a lawsuit brought by shareholders in the Sunbeam Corp. appliance company alleging that the accounting firm signed off on a company audit that included fictitious profits. On Monday, former Sunbeam chief executive Albert J. Dunlap, nicknamed "Chainsaw Al" for his job-cutting enthusiasm, agreed to pay $15 million to settle a similar lawsuit by shareholders. 
Andersen similarly agreed to pay part of a $220 million class-action settlement and a $7 million SEC fine in a case in which another of its clients, Waste Management Inc., overstated its income by more than $1 billion. 
Andersen now finds itself in the position that it often warned its clients against risking. In a 1999 report, Andersen executives Andrew Flaig and Gloria Chang told the firm's hospitality industry clients that they needed to be wary of financial reporting fraud, or what Flaig and Chang called "cooking the books." 
The executives warned that "widespread publicity involving disclosure of financial statement fraud is clear evidence of how damaging this is to a company." 
They said that the resulting costs could include "precipitous drops in market value, . . . multiple shareholder lawsuits and damages material to the entities' financial statements, damaged employee morale and retention and extensive amounts of time diverted." 
In the report, they urged their clients to be wary of these warning signs: "Inadequate leadership at the top, weak internal controls, autocratic senior management, collusion among accounting employees and aggressive accounting policies."

Politics & Policy
Arthur Andersen May Lack Insurance To Cover Judgments
By Christopher Oster
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

In dealing with lawsuits stemming from its actions as Enron Corp.'s outside auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP likely won't be able to pass the bulk of any potential judgments against the big accounting firm on to insurance companies because Andersen, in large part, serves as its own insurer. 
Andersen already has been hit with shareholder lawsuits seeking class-action status in connection with its audits of the energy-trading firm, which filed for bankruptcy-court protection late last year. Securities-law specialists said Andersen's ability to successfully fight the lawsuits took a hit yesterday with its announcement that it was firing its lead auditor on the Enron engagement, on the heels of its announcement last week of document destruction by certain employees.
The coverage available for litigation in cases like that of Enron would fall under Andersen's errors-and-omissions liability coverage. It is unclear how much coverage Andersen purchased from insurance carriers. And like the other Big Five accounting firms, Andersen carries a large deductible, which means it is on the hook for smaller claims, said Leo Beus of Beus Gilbert PLLC, a Phoenix law firm, that has won several suits against the big accounting firms and in the process has become familiar with their insurance coverage. 
For payments that exceed the coverage limits on its outside insurance, Andersen would tap into an insurance pool that it jointly funds with other big accounting firms, including some outside the U.S., according to Mr. Beus. This pool, based in Bermuda, operates as an insurance company would, investing its assets and paying claims as needed. 
An Andersen spokesman declined to comment about the firm's insurance coverage. 
Mark Cheffers, chief executive of AccountingMalpractice.com, which advises accounting firms on how to reduce liability risk, said the Big Five are secretive about their insurance coverage because they don't want plaintiffs' attorneys to know how large a pool of money they maintain to pay judgments. 
In a 1994 speech before a House subcommittee, J. Michael Cook, then-chairman of Deloitte & Touche, said the big accounting firms "have virtually no outside insurance." He said the firms, due to tremendous growth of litigation against them, "pooled our own risks." 
Mr. Cheffers said it was unlikely that Andersen's insurance coverage -- including the deductible and pooled portion -- for any single year would be greater than $300 million. "At the end of the day it's designed so it's largely self insurance," Mr. Cheffers said. 
Mr. Cheffers said plaintiffs' attorneys generally are hesitant to push any one firm into dire financial straits. "The one thing Andersen has going for it is that the class-action attorneys recognize that they don't want to kill the goose, and that they can get more money out of Andersen in 10 years than in one." 
For its part, Enron is expected to tap into $300 million in directors-and-officers liability coverage provided by several big insurance companies, as previously reported.

SEC, Accounting Firms Redrafting Audit Rules; Agency Chairman Draws Fire for Role in Effort

Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey L. Pitt and the accounting industry are scrambling to craft a new system for policing auditors in an effort to shore up confidence in the financial reports of publicly traded companies. 
The new plan, which could be unveiled within days, is designed to head off criticism in the wake of the Enron Corp. fiasco that the current system of self-regulation does not work. The effort is being driven by Pitt, who faces complaints from some lawmakers that he should distance himself from the SEC's investigation.
Pitt represented the five major accounting firms as a private lawyer before he was appointed by President Bush to take over the SEC on Aug. 4. 
Sens. Jon S. Corzine (D-N.J.) and Byron L. Dorgan (D-N.D.) have said Pitt's previous ties to the industry should require him to declare a hands-off policy. "I think Harvey Pitt has a high degree of integrity," said Corzine, a former partner with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. "But I do believe for appearance' sake . . . Pitt ought to do what Attorney General John Ashcroft has done and clearly step aside from the process." 
But Pitt disagreed. "To talk about recusals at this point misperceives how this agency operates," he said in an interview. 
Pitt said he has done and will continue to do his job in accordance with ethics rules, which forbid -- but with some exceptions -- the SEC chairman from taking any action concerning a former client for a year after taking office. 
The SEC, which regulates financial markets, is also responsible for the oversight of accounting firms, which are supposed to certify that financial records give a fair portrait of a company's finances. 
With the Enron collapse focusing criticism on accounting firms, the SEC is facing conflict-of-interest questions, not only because of Pitt's former ties to the industry, but also because Bush's two nominations for vacant seats on the five-member SEC come from big accounting firms. 
Pitt yesterday would not comment on how he voted last fall, when the commission agreed to launch an investigation into the Enron affair. That investigation is examining the role played by Enron officials and the company's outside auditor, Arthur Andersen. 
Pitt also would not specify what he would do if the SEC staff were to come before the commission again, at the conclusion of its investigation, with recommendations that actions be taken against companies or accounting firms. 
"Enforcement inquiries are conducted by our staff and the SEC commissioners do not have any involvement in the myriad decisions that our enforcement staff will be called upon to make," Pitt said. 
"It is not the function of the chairman of the SEC or any commissioner to manage any investigations. If and when I am asked to do anything on this matter, I will follow both the letter and the spirit of the ethical requirements of this office. Any suggestion that I would do otherwise is an attempt to politicize the workings of an independent agency." 
Pitt also would not comment on the negotiations he is having with the top five accounting firms and the industry trade group, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants -- all of them former clients -- on how to revamp oversight of the profession. An SEC spokesman said those discussions are permitted by ethics rules and are appropriate. 
Industry sources said that talk about a regulatory overhaul, a topic that has been kicked around for years, was given new impetus after Enron's failure. Enron filed for bankruptcy Dec. 2 after being forced to restate earnings. The industry wants to unveil its proposal before Congress reconvenes next Wednesday and begins hearings into what caused the energy company's problems, sources said. 
The new framework would create a private-sector regulatory organization, similar to those that the SEC now permits the securities markets to use to discipline members and establish guidelines for what is accepted and unacceptable behavior, industry sources said. 
But the organization would not be controlled by accounting firms, the sources said, because it would be governed by boards whose members would come largely from outside the accounting industry. Accounting industry officials acknowledge that the reforms may not go far enough to quell criticism from consumer groups and some lawmakers, who say self-regulation is at the root of the accounting profession's problems. 
The five major accounting firms declined to comment on the proposal. 
The major accounting firms, in the past, have fought such a proposal, insisting that the current system, which includes industry self-regulating groups and state licensing boards, are sufficient. But in missing seemingly egregious misstatements and incorrect reports at Enron, the Arthur Andersen team raised anew questions about how well the nation's system of private accountants, paid by their audit clients, serves the nation's investors. 
The federal government gave the accounting industry the valuable franchise to audit companies that sell shares to the public after the stock market crash of 1929. In return, auditors are supposed to serve the public interest, and maintain independence from their clients. 
"The true client is society in an audit -- yet the client that is paying your fee is the corporation," said Stephen Loeb, professor of accounting and business ethics at the University of Maryland. With this system, "you have a conflict of interest. It's always going to be there," he said. 
In addition, many accounting firms earn large sums by selling consulting services to their clients. For instance, Andersen was paid $52 million last year by Enron -- $25 million for auditing and $27 million for consulting services. 
Accountants argue that they are professionals who can and do stand up to their clients when that is necessary. And, they add, ultimately their livelihood depends on retaining the public's trust. Otherwise, they say, audits would lose their value. 
That, though, is exactly what is happening, some critics charge. 
Arthur Levitt Jr., chairman of the SEC during the Clinton administration, proposed prohibiting accounting firms from selling certain consulting services to corporations whose books they audit in 2000. But that proposal was beaten back by the accounting industry and was opposed by several members of Congress. 
In addition, generally accepted accounting principles, the rules that accountants must follow in auditing public companies, allow considerable flexibility in evaluating what a business has done. Some lawmakers question whether those rules give accounting firms too much latitude. 
"Does the Enron debacle (and cases like it) rest on activity that is allowable under generally accepted accounting principles and standards, or that constitutes clear violations of those principles and standards, or some combination thereof?" Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.), ranking minority member of the House Commerce Committee, asked the SEC last month. 
Auditing problems are not new. The late 1990s saw a wave of "restatements," in which many major companies, including Rite-Aid Corp., Sunbeam Corp., Waste Management Inc. and Cendant Corp., were forced to admit that profits reported earlier had been vastly overstated. 
Some cases involved fraud, which auditors said they are ill-prepared to detect. Critics have said that auditors should do more extensive checks of contracts, deliveries and other aspects of a company's operation. But accountants warn that would make routine audits far more expensive. They say that in fierce competition for clients, the lowest cost auditor often wins.

O'Neill says US derivatives rules may need modernising in wake of Enron case

01/16/2002
AFX News
(c) 2002 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

WASHINGTON (AFX) - Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill said US derivatives regulations may need modernising, in the wake of the bankruptcy of Enron Corp. 
"In this case, I think it's fair to say it may be that our rules and regulations have gotten behind practices," O'Neill said in an interview on the PBS Charlie Rose program.
At heart of the Enron bankruptcy was the firm's dealing with derivatives trading, he explained, which "got away from them." 
Derivatives that are four to five levels deep from the original product they are based on are extremely complex, he said, and the laws and regulations addressing information disclosure need to be modernised. 
A second factor is that some of Enron's actions possibly "didn't pass muster when they're held up against what the law required" under existing rules, he added. To the extent that anybody broke the law, "they should go to jail." 
O'Neill also said he would not have made the call former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin made to a senior current Treasury official concerning intervention with credit rating agencies and Enron's banks. 
According to the Treasury, Rubin called Treasury Undersecretary Peter Fisher and brought up the possibility of Fisher calling the ratings agencies and encouraging them to work with Enron's banks to avoid a credit downgrade. 
O'Neill said it was up to Rubin to decide whether the call was appropriate, but that he would not have made such a call. 
Separately, O'Neill said he believes he has 100 pct backing in his position from President George Bush, in face of criticism from politicians and the media on his job performance. 
Regarding the US economy, O'Neill said the US has now "put in place the conditions that in a reasonably quick period of time will restore growth" to 3.0-3.5 pct. 
Europe and Japan need to do the same, he said, to ensure the world's three major economies are driving global development. 
Asked about Argentina's crisis, the Treasury Secretary said Bush told him "the concept here is friendly amigo," with the US offering technical and policy advice to the new government, to help it establish a program that can restore growth. 
However, he drew a distinction between Argentina and Mexico, which in 1995 received a multi-billion dollar bailout from the previous Clinton administration. 
In the Mexican situation, US aid was collateralised with Mexican oil revenues. 
In Argentina's case, however, "they don't have anything left to collateralise," he said. 
O'Neill also said the US only "reluctantly went along with the notion at the IMF that they should be given one more chance," last August, when the IMF boosted its loan program for Argentina by 8.0 bln usd.

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE DONATIONS
Enron's Ties to a Leader of House Republicans Went Beyond Contributions to His Campaign
By ALISON MITCHELL

01/16/2002
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 2
c. 2002 New York Times Company

WASHINGTON, Jan. 15 -- It is well known that the Enron Corporation lavished money and attention on political figures all over the nation's capital. But for an insight into how carefully the company cultivated members of Congress, look no further than its efforts to please its home state powerhouse, Representative Tom DeLay. 
Like other members of the Texas delegation, Mr. DeLay, a Republican whose district is in the Houston suburbs near Enron's headquarters, received sizable personal campaign donations from Enron -- $28,900 since 1989, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
Yet Mr. DeLay, the House majority whip, is not just another lawmaker. The donations were only a starting point. 
Enron used as lobbyists two influential members of Mr. DeLay's informal kitchen cabinet, Ed Buckham and Karl Gallant. 
Mr. Buckham, a former chief of staff for Mr. DeLay, has worked closely on strategy with Mr. DeLay's political action committee, Americans for a Republican Majority. And Mr. Gallant, who once served as that committee's director, went on to run the Republican Majority Issues Committee, a group widely considered close to Mr. DeLay, whose allies once hoped that the issues committee would serve as a counterweight to unions by financing get-out-the-vote efforts for conservative candidates. 
Records also show that Enron and its executives made sizable donations to each of the groups. The 2000 disclosure statement for Mr. Gallant's committee includes a $50,000 contribution from Enron's chairman, Kenneth L. Lay, and a $25,000 contribution from Joseph W. Sutton, a vice chairman of Enron who left the company in November. Before that year, disclosure was not required for gifts to issues groups. 
Americans for a Republican Majority received a $10,000 corporate contribution from Enron in 2000 for its unregulated ''soft money'' account. And according to the Center for Responsive Politics, the group also received $47,250 in regulated contributions in 1995 through 2000 from Enron, its political action committee or individuals tied to the company. 
Mr. DeLay's spokesman, Stuart Roy, said there was nothing unusual about Mr. DeLay's relationship with Enron. He described the company as ''an equal-opportunity political donor and an equal-opportunity employer, as well, hiring lobbyists who were both Republicans and Democrats and giving money to both sides, including a third of House Democrats and half of the Senate Democrats.'' 
Mr. Gallant said he would not discuss his dealings with Enron, citing a confidentiality clause in his contract. Mr. Buckham did not return a phone call, and an aide said he would be unavailable until later this month. 
Mr. DeLay has been unabashed about demanding that business support Republicans, whom he considers commerce's natural ally. Aides said he froze Enron out of his office for some of the past year because it had hired Linda Robinson, a Democrat who was a senior Treasury official in the Clinton administration, to run its Washington office. 
Mr. DeLay has previously urged lobbying firms and trade associations to install more Republicans in executive positions. Indeed, the House Ethics Committee wrote a warning, but took no official action, after he tried to persuade a lobbying group not to hire a Democrat as its president in 1998. 
Still, whatever the tensions last year, Mr. Delay and Enron had a natural alliance. In his days in the Texas Capitol, Mr. DeLay was called Dereg by some because of his support of business. And in Congress he has been a longtime proponent of energy deregulation, an issue dear to Enron. 
Moreover, last year he was the chief Republican strategist who pushed through the House energy legislation that was favored by Enron and many other energy companies. Three years ago, when Enron lost out to a Japanese company in bidding to build a power plant in the Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands, a United States territory in the Pacific, Mr. DeLay asked for the bidding to be reopened. 
In some ways, Mr. DeLay's support for Enron was a matter of constituent service. Mr. Roy said that Enron's success had always been important to Mr. DeLay because of the hundreds of people the company employed in his Congressional district and the thousands of others in nearby Houston. 
''Obviously, DeLay would not be doing his job if he were not trying to help job creation by a major company in Houston,'' Mr. Roy said. 
He said Mr. DeLay had never asked that the company hire his former aides as lobbyists. 
It is also the case that Enron cultivated the other side of the aisle. For example, Michael Lewan, a former chief of staff to Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, the Connecticut Democrat who is running one investigation into the company's collapse, worked for Enron for a time, a spokesman for Mr. Lieberman confirmed. The spokesman, Dan Gerstein, said Mr. Lewan, who remains a political adviser to Mr. Lieberman, had severed his ties to the company. 
Enron officials in Washington referred questions to a company official in Houston who did not return a call. 
Having a lobbyist who is close to a lawmaker can help a company get attention. In 1999 Mr. Buckham told Mr. DeLay that the Japanese company had successfully bid to build the power plant in the Northern Marianas. Mr. DeLay wrote his letter asking that the bidding be reopened. 
Mr. Roy said there had been rumors at the time that some bidders had been locked out of the competition. He said Mr. DeLay's letter did not advocate on behalf of Enron, but for ''a fair and open bidding system.'' Mr. Roy said he did not know who won the final contract. 
A former aide to Mr. DeLay who did not want to be identified said of Enron, ''They certainly through Ed Buckham got more attention than people who didn't have Ed Buckham.'' 
After Enron hired Ms. Robertson for its Washington office in late 2000, relations with Mr. DeLay became more distant. ''Relations were chilly all last year,'' Mr. Roy said. 
But as the member of the House Republican leadership shepherding Mr. Bush's program through the House, Mr. DeLay pulled off a stunning upset and built a coalition of Republicans and Democrats to pass energy legislation sought by many companies, including Enron. 
Mr. Roy said Mr. DeLay had received no warnings that Enron was in deep financial trouble. With many of the hard-pressed Enron employees in his district, Mr. DeLay called the situation ''heartbreaking'' in an interview with a Houston television station this week and said his goal now was to find out whether there had been criminal wrongdoing by the company.

Hooley and Blumenauer return Enron cash

SALEM, Ore. (AP) - Reps. Darlene Hooley and Earl Blumenauer, both Oregon Democrats, became the latest politicians to return campaign contributions from Enron, the failed energy giant. 
Enron went bankrupt Dec. 2 after disclosing that its faulty accounting practices concealed huge losses. Top executives sold millions of dollars of stock before the collapse, but many employees were barred from selling shares held in their company 401(k) plans.
"The news over the past several weeks of the financial collapse of Enron has been devastating for individuals and families throughout the United States," Hooley wrote to Enron CEO Kenneth Lay on Dec. 21, enclosing a check for the $1,000 the company's political action committee had sent her. 
"They, like most Americans, are not analysts and experts in the field of financial investment," Hooley continued. "They believed in your company's financial projections. They believed you and your board of directors." 
Enron was widely noted for its political influence. Since its demise, several politicians from around the country, including Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore, have returned or donated contributions. 
Upon hearing of the company's bankruptcy filing and realizing she had gotten money from its PAC, Hooley initially tried to send the money to employees who have sued the company, said her chief of staff, Joan Mooney. 
But taxes would have eaten up more than half of the donation, and the payoff to individual employees or investors would have been negligible. 
Blumenauer announced Wednesday that he is donating $2,200 in campaign donations made by Enron's PAC to a private nonprofit group that is retraining laid-off Enron employees. 
"I am pleased to give the money from Enron's corporate PAC to a good cause, especially when so many Oregonians have been hurt by the company's collapse," Blumenauer said in a statement. 
Blumenauer also got contributions from people employed by companies bought out by Enron, including Portland General Electric. 
The congressman said he is not returning those donations because they were made by longtime supporters and personal friends.

The Essentials Of a Washington Scandal; Enron Has Possibility. But Something's Still Missing.

It's still early, but, yes, it's possible. If everything goes to form, and everyone executes according to the playbook, this one could go all the way: The collapse of Enron Corp. could turn out to be another Incomprehensible Washington Scandal. 
An IWS is one of those events that, like Halley's comet, periodically lights up the sky. It fascinates some and disappoints others -- but it mostly baffles everyone else.
In the beginning, you understand the basic plot of an IWS. Somebody in high office allegedly did something he wasn't supposed to do. But soon the leaked memos start colliding with the press conferences, which pile into the transcripts and the congressional hearings. Lawyers and spokesmen materialize. 
Soon, you've lost it. The simple story becomes so barnacled with facts and accusations, so encumbered with major and minor players, that the core is no longer recognizable. You struggle to keep pace, but it's not long before you're being lapped by the field. 
By definition, an IWS is so convoluted that it is understood only by participants, partisans, lawyers and a few very nerdy journalists -- all of whom are paid to pay attention anyway. An IWS involves allegations about things that might have been said, on dates that are in dispute, by people who may or may not have had the legal authority to do what they (allegedly) did. All IWSes inspire congressional hearings, although early in the process the hearings take place before panels with names like the House Subcommittee on Intra-government Affairs, Federal Rules and Oversight Operations Management. 
A new IWS erupts about once every 18 months, give or take, which means Enron's timing could be just about perfect. IWSes rarely overlap, the media and political classes' endurance being what it is. The Asian Fundraising Scandal followed Filegate, which followed Travel Officegate, which followed Whitewater, which followed the House Post Office Scandal, which followed the HUD Debacle, which followed the Savings & Loan Scandals, which followed Iran-contra. And so on back to Teapot Dome. 
What with its destroyed documents, suspect accounting reports and eye-glazing concepts like "off-balance sheet partnerships," Enron is halfway to classic IWS status. Almost every IWS involves money, but not money alone. It also needs some Byzantine connection (or plausibly imputed connection) to some kind of official influence-peddling. This distinguishes an IWS from a Simple Washington Scandal (SWS), which is usually about sex, and therefore not especially perplexing (everyone understands sex, or thinks they do). 
So: Wilbur Mills's fling with stripper Fanne Fox was an SWS, as was Gary Hart's friendship with Donna Rice, as were Bill Clinton's problems with Paula Jones and Monica Lewinsky. Bob Packwood's personnel-management techniques were an SWS, as were Clarence Thomas's movie preferences. Gary Condit's relationship with Chandra Levy was an SWS, but with an asterisk: It involved sex and the suspicion of violence. 
Perhaps the easiest way to tell a bona fide IWS from an SWS is by the media that cover it. CNN, the New York Times and The Washington Post take on both kinds (although they are much later to an SWS than an IWS). The National Enquirer and the Star were all over Lewinsky et al., but don't expect to read much about "off-balance sheet partnerships" in them. 
Further, there are few, if any, telegenic props associated with an IWS. There is never a stained dress or a yacht called Monkey Business. There are, mostly, memos. 
We'll know for sure when Enron has become a full-blown IWS when it achieves the following milestones of every true IWS: 
* A catchy name. All IWSes require a spiffy nickname. So far, Enron hasn't gotten there, but there have been some rudimentary attempts. 
The media continues to shorthand Enron as "the biggest corporate bankruptcy in U.S. history," which is accurate, but hardly headline-ready. 
New York Times columnist William Safire, pointing to the failings of accounting firm Arthur Andersen, dubbed this aspect of the story "Andersen-gate," "-gate" being the predictable suffix for every IWS and SWS since Water-. 
The Democratic National Committee last week was floating "Enron-omics" as a way to disparage the Bush Administration's tax and budget initiatives. Alas, this falls short, too, if you're trying to gin up an IWS. The "-omics" suffix ("Reaganomics") merely suggests a style of policy, not corruption. If it turns out someone illegally cut corners, maybe this one will become known as "End-ron." 
* Buzzwords. No IWS is fully realized until certain legal and quasi-legal phrases start flying: "subpoena," "grand jury," "special counsel," "nolo contendre." We're not there yet. All we've been able to muster so far are the hoary soporifics of every two-bit D.C. dispute: "conflict of interest," "appearance of a conflict of interest," and the unlovely "suggestion of the appearance of a conflict of interest." 
* Regrettable catchphrases. One of the great subsidiary values of an IWS is that it sometimes throws off a preposterous or startling catchphrase. Again, Enron is not fully developed enough to generate entries into the rhetorical pantheon that includes "I'm not a potted plant," "No controlling legal authority," and the ultimate: "I am not a crook." 
* The Lawyer as Character. Count on the media to elevate some unglamorous, balding guy in a baggy gray suit to the status of Righteous Crusader for Justice, or at least Colorful Rogue during a long-running IWS. Brendan Sullivan got there during Iran-Contra. David Boies made it during the Microsoft antitrust trial (technically, not an IWS, but very close). No sightings on Enron yet. 
* The Dragon Lady. Even the dreariest IWS eventually coughs up one or two semi-glamorous women to enliven the proceedings. The woman in question may be a key player, or she may hold a minor role. Doesn't matter. Either way, she's bound to look good next to all the balding lawyers in baggy gray suits. Remember Fawn Hall, Deborah Gore Dean, Susan McDougal and Mo Dean? 
* The Non-Denouement. Quick: What was the result of every IWS of the past 15 years? Surely, after all those special prosecutors, all that media coverage, all that distracting government focus, there was some outcome. Wasn't there?

Commentary No Special Counsel on Enron

The fast developing Enron story has now reached Washington scandal status. 
Adding to the frenzy, some Democratic leaders sound as though they regret the demise of the independent counsel legislation, something most of them applauded when it happened in 1999. If that legislation had not expired, these critics would have been able to demand that the Bush administration request an independent counsel and then make political hay when the administration refused. This would have been reminiscent of the Republican onslaught against Atty. Gen. Janet Reno for refusing to request an independent counsel to investigate charges of campaign financing misdeeds in the 1996 Clinton campaign.
Instead, the critics can only call for the Justice Department to appoint a special counsel. Yet on the basis of the facts known so far, this would be wrongheaded and inconsistent, nothing more than a return to the familiar partisan political game of "gotcha!" 
Enron's collapse may indeed justify investigations by Congress, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department, all of which are underway. 
The attorney general and his chief of staff have properly recused themselves because of political contributions made by Enron, and a special Justice task force has been created to conduct the investigation. 
There appears to be no reason that the professional prosecutors on this task force cannot be trusted to be objective and thorough. 
Then what was the necessity for past independent counsels, which Congress legislated after the Watergate scandal? 
That legislation never was intended to replace the Justice Department as the official law enforcement arm of the federal government; Congress could not constitutionally do this. Rather, the independent counsel legislation was aimed at the rare circumstance in which an attorney general would be faced with a serious conflict of interest in having to investigate substantial and credible criminal charges against the president or a high Cabinet official. 
In Watergate, exactly such a conflict existed for Atty. Gen. Elliot L. Richardson when criminal charges were pending against President Nixon's top staff and former Cabinet members, charges that implicated the president. At the time, Richardson appointed a regulatory special prosecutor, Harvard law professor Archibald Cox. Only after Nixon fired Cox did the Senate Watergate Committee conclude that new legislation was needed. 
I believe this legislation worked well from 1978 to the mid-1980s. It was used sparingly and had the confidence of the public. But beginning with the Iran-Contra investigation and through the numerous investigations involving the Clinton administration, it was overused. It became publicly and politically unpopular and so was not reenacted by Congress. 
So far, nothing made public about Enron would have justified the appointment of an independent counsel. There are no charges that President Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney or any member of the Cabinet had complicity in Enron's financial failure. Yes, Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay was a major financial supporter of Bush and thus had access to the president and Cabinet members. But such access has always been an inherent feature of the American political system. With no evidence of improper favors, it is at most an impropriety. The remedy is campaign financing reform. 
The administration has disclosed that in October, just as Enron was going under, Lay contacted Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill and Commerce Secretary Don Evans and may have asked for help in protecting Enron's credit rating. But it seems that no such help was given. Apparently, the administration did nothing to prevent the company's financial failure and the resulting losses to shareholders and employees. It is not clear what the administration could have done, even in October. But if anyone in the administration had intervened to save Enron, the critics would now be making even more serious allegations. The investigations should go forward without a supplemental independent investigator. With regard to possible criminal charges, the Justice task force should conduct an aggressive investigation. The accounting practices used to falsely report huge profits, misleading investors and employees, need to be exposed and those responsible made accountable. 
The congressional and SEC investigations must thoroughly examine the role of corporate directors, auditors and large accounting firms to determine whether outside audits are truly independent. 
Tragic as it is to so many investors and employees, Enron's failure could serve as a wake-up call for American politics and business.

. . . Especially From Republicans

Washington -- narcissistic and even solipsistic, as usual -- thinks Enron's collapse is primarily a Washington, meaning a political, story. Actually, the debacle is, so far, primarily a tale of two other cities. Houston is Enron's hometown. New York is the center of the financial system that Arthur Andersen is supposed to serve. Andersen is the document-destroying accounting firm that failed -- assuming, generously, that it tried -- to report accurately Enron's activities. 
However, Washington will star in subsequent acts of this drama that may live on, in litigation, longer than anyone reading this column. Events since Sept. 11 have confirmed Randolph Bourne's 1918 axiom that "war is the health of the state." Enron's collapse is a reminder that economic scandal, too, causes the state to wax.
It will remind everyone -- some conservatives, painfully -- that a mature capitalist economy is a government project. A properly functioning free market system does not spring spontaneously from society's soil as dandelions spring from suburban lawns. Rather, it is a complex creation of laws and mores that guarantee, among much else, transparency, meaning a sufficient stream -- torrent, really -- of reliable information about the condition and conduct of corporations. 
Always necessary to economic health, transparency has increasingly become crucial to civic health because of the changed demographics of stock ownership. A nation in which a majority of households own equities is neurologically wired to the stock market. Hence corporate corruption quickly begets political demoralization and cynicism. 
Off and on over the years, a few capitalists have done more to delegitimize capitalism than America's impotent socialist critics ever did or today's moribund left could hope to. It is the Republicans' special responsibility to punish such capitalists. 
Democrats are properly put on the defensive by corruption in organized labor and the ditziness of the cultural left. Similarly, Republicans, beginning with their post-Civil War entanglement with corporate America (tariffs and all that), have had a special responsibility to police business outlaws. 
Fortunately, those in the Bush administration who were approached on Enron's behalf evidently did exactly what government should do for fools and clever knaves who are ruining a corporation: nothing. But now there are things to be done. 
Indignation is a precondition for whatever new laws and regulations are required to prevent behavior such as Enron's. It has been said that the absence of honest emotion is the shared characteristic of American politics and professional wrestling. One would like to hear from President Bush, regarding Enron's executives, the sort of anger he expressed over the possibility that the crybaby Secret Service agent whose behavior caused an American Airlines pilot to bar him from a flight might have been a victim of illegitimate profiling. 
Instead, we have heard Bush's slippery -- Clintonian, actually -- assertion that Enron's CEO, Ken Lay, "was a supporter of Ann Richards in my run in 1994" for governor. Well, yes, but no. Lay contributed to Richards. And he contributed much more to Bush. 
When the president finds his proper voice, he should say: 
Arthur Andersen was both accountant and consultant for Enron. The resulting relationship reeked of conflict of interest, and surely helped produce Enron account books that should be filed under "fiction." Enron never reported even a bad quarter before collapsing. Consulting by accounting firms should be proscribed. And what is the point of "peer reviews" by the big accounting firms of one another's work if they do not discern an approaching train wreck such as Enron's? 
A few senior Enron executives sold their Enron stock when they realized they were steering their ship onto the rocks. In some crucial final days, employees, locked in steerage like the lower orders on the Titanic, were blocked from selling the Enron stock that comprised, on average, 62 percent of employees' 401(k) holdings. (At 120 large corporations, employees' 401(k) plans have at least one-third of their value in their employers' stocks.) If insider trading and other laws do not proscribe such things, they should. 
Amid the debris of Enron, the functions and liabilities of boards of directors need fresh scrutiny. Many boards have proved themselves unwilling (there are myriad forms of coziness between corporations and their directors) or unable to stop the most scandalous practices regarding senior executives' compensation, practices not easily distinguishable from the looting of shareholders' wealth. Let us have, at a minimum, congressional hearings that embarrass the looters, if they are capable of embarrassment. 
Now Washington takes center stage. By casting a cool eye on Enron's debris and those who made it, government can strengthen an economic system that depends on it.

Media Split on Import of Enron

Judging by the sudden media explosion, the Enron saga is a high-octane political scandal of the first order. 
Or, some journalists say, it's a badly hyped bit of Beltway intrigue that will run out of gas because the Bush White House did nothing wrong.
A senior administration official blames the coverage on "a bunch of scandal-thirsty reporters who are dying to hit the bottle, even though it's not alcoholic." 
In the days since the White House revealed that Enron CEO Kenneth Lay called two Cabinet officers shortly before his energy-trading company collapsed in the largest bankruptcy in American history, the press has jumped on the story with Whitewater-like intensity. But since the administration refused to help Lay, a long time friend and financial backer of President Bush, the coverage has an almost schizophrenic quality. 
Jonah Goldberg, editor of National Review Online, sees journalists firing at their favorite targets. 
"Bush has gotten a really good ride out of the press during the war for a long time, and rightly so," he says. "All of a sudden there's this huge story that Democrats, for reasons good and ill, are trying to make hay out of. You can see the press saying we have to go back to our muckraker roots and get to the bottom of it. It's natural for the press to want to show that business is evil." 
But Robert Scheer, a Los Angeles Times columnist who has called Enron a "cancer on the presidency," maintains the press has gone soft. "Journalists should be asking the question 'What did you know and when did you know it?' " he says. Scheer argues that "the media backed off" on White House coverage after Sept. 11 and have been "cheerleading" for Bush. 
This philosophical split is reflected in the news reports. "The rapidly exploding Enron inquiry presents all the elements of earlier Washington scandals," the New York Times said Friday, "including carefully phrased denials and accusations of improper influence." 
The Washington Post took a similar tack: "It's too soon to say whether Enron Corp.'s spectacular collapse will become a bona fide Washington scandal, but the classic elements suddenly burst into view yesterday -- disclosures of destroyed documents, White House phone calls from a big political contributor, an attorney general's recusal and damage control efforts by the president." 
But the Washington Times cast Bush as a reformer, relegating the White House calls to the eighth paragraph: "President Bush yesterday decried the 'awful bankruptcy' of Enron Corp. and ordered a review of pension disclosure laws to help protect the life savings of workers at other troubled firms." And USA Today went with the headline: "Bush Seeks Review of 401(k) Law." 
"I couldn't find anything improper or illegal in Enron officials calling Cabinet secretaries," says Washington Times correspondent Bill Sammon. "I'm not going to join people who are throwing around a lot of innuendo and insinuation. . . . Of course the White House was defensive, in response to accusatory questions from the press." 
White House spokesman Ari Fleischer faults The Post for including "disclosures of destroyed documents" in the article's first sentence before explaining that the papers were shredded by auditor Arthur Andersen & Co. "The velocity with which this story has taken off in the minds of the Washington press corps is way ahead of the pace of the facts," Fleischer says. 
Conservatives, noting that Enron also gave sizable sums to Democrats, ridicule the notion that the White House/Enron story should be covered like Bill Clinton's scandals. White House adviser Mary Matalin told radio host Don Imus that Bush's critics "act like there's some billing records or some cattle scam or some fired travel aides or some blue dress." 
"The comparison to Whitewater really doesn't hold," says Goldberg. "No one is alleging that Bush gained personally from this." (As it turned out, the Clintons lost money on their Whitewater land deal.) 
There is little dispute that the Enron meltdown is a major-league financial scandal in which company insiders dumped their stock before employees started losing their life savings. But despite the Houston firm's Dec. 2 bankruptcy filing, the story was largely relegated to the business pages and rarely mentioned on television. Exceptions included the New York Times and Wall Street Journal -- as well as the Los Angeles Times and San Francisco Chronicle, where local interest was fueled by Enron's role in California's energy crisis. 
As late as Aug. 28, after the former CEO abruptly resigned, the Houston Chronicle was cautious in a front-page report: "Even though nothing major appears to be wrong at Enron Corp., investor confidence in the world's largest energy trader remains shaky." 
Jim Cramer, a former money manager and co-host of CNBC's "America Now," says an Enron executive complained to his bosses months ago when he charged that the company was "unraveling" and that its stock was going to zero. 
"My producer and I have been saying for weeks, 'Are we the only guys who think this is a big story?' " Cramer says. "Everyone just kept quoting the same analysts, saying it's all much ado about nothing. The Wall Street analysts worked at firms that were doing massive amounts of investment banking business with Enron." 
Paul Begala, a former Clinton aide who now teaches at Georgetown University, says Enron deserves far more coverage than the Monica Lewinsky melodrama. "Clinton having an affair is pretty much between him, his wife and his girlfriend," Begala says. "It didn't hurt America. Nobody lost their savings. This is a very big deal." 
Begala says Bush hurt himself by claiming last week that Lay supported Ann Richards over him for Texas governor in 1994 -- a claim that was prominently debunked by Texas newspapers but only briefly mentioned elsewhere. 
"The lesson I learned from the Lewinsky thing is a president must never lie," Begala says. Bush "got off very, very easy," he says, because the press is "a bunch of cream puffs."

Enron Pumped Cash Into Tanks Too

Politicians weren't the only ones getting gobs of cash from Kenneth L. Lay, the embattled chairman of Enron Corp., the Houston-based energy trading company that collapsed last month amid allegations of accounting hanky-panky and management misdeeds. 
In recent years, Lay or Enron contributed thousands of dollars to Resources for the Future and the American Enterprise Institute. Lay also serves on the board of directors of the two high-profile Washington-based think tanks.
"Enron has contributed periodically to RFF since 1990, with gifts ranging from $10,000 to $45,000" to the general fund, said Jonathan Halperin, director of communications planning and strategy at RFF. The $45,000 contribution was made last fall to honor the 50th anniversary of the think tank, which researches issues related to natural resources and the environment. 
And yes, "the check did clear," reported Ted Hand, RFF's vice president for finance and administration. 
In addition, the Linda and Ken Lay Foundation pledged in 2000 to endow a research chair at RFF. In 2000, the foundation contributed a total of $15,000, Halperin said. 
The Enron chairman briefly served on the RFF board of directors in the mid-1980s. He rejoined the board in April 2000. 
Lay has served on AEI's board of trustees since 1994. AEI officials declined to say how much Lay or Enron has contributed to the tank. 
"We have a firm rule about not discussing the amount of contributions or where they come from," said Executive Vice President David Gerson, though he noted wryly that AEI got less than RFF did last year. 
AEI is the intellectual home of Lynne V. Cheney, wife of Vice President Cheney and an AEI senior fellow. The vice president and Lay were on a panel together at AEI's World Forum on June 24, the White House said in a letter to Congress released last week. 
GETTING TOGETHER: Here's another unexpected consequence of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks: "Whites trust blacks more, Asians trust Latinos more, and so on, than these very same people did a year ago," reports Harvard political scientist Robert Putnam. 
Putnam, the intellectual guru of the civic engagement movement, based his surprising claim on a new analysis of surveys conducted by the Saguaro Seminar at Harvard. The first poll was conducted in 2000. Last October, researchers returned to the same people and posed the questions again to see if their attitudes had changed following the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. 
They had. "Evidence of enhanced trust across ethnic and other social divisions is especially striking and gratifying," Putnam writes in the American Prospect due out this week. For example, the proportion of whites and Asians who said they trusted blacks "a lot" increased from 22 percent to 29 percent, Putnam reported. 
VOUCHING FOR SCHOOL CHOICE: School vouchers didn't make the final cut in the recent education bill, but they're still a smoking hot topic in Washington with the Supreme Court set to hear oral arguments in the Cleveland voucher case next month. 
With this timing in mind, the Cato Institute announced the launch of the Center for Education Freedom, to be run by new hire David Salisbury. The center will run on an annual budget of $450,000 and start with a staff of four. 
"We'll be looking at proposals in the 50 states, including tuition tax credits, scholarship tax credits like they have in Arizona, and how to decrease the role of the federal government in special education," Salisbury said. "We're also looking at for-profit and nonprofit educational entrepreneurs who are providing options for managing schools and educating kids outside the government." 
Salisbury, a former education professor at Florida State University, comes to the libertarian tank from Utah, where he spent five years running the Sutherland Institute, a small, free-market think tank. 
(Perhaps there's some sort of East-West libertarian exchange going on. Cato's previous education expert, Darcy Olsen, left the District last fall to become the executive director of the Phoenix-based Goldwater Institute.) 
On a related subject, the Center for Education Reform, a pro school-choice advocacy group, just released the seventh edition of its National Charter School Directory, which includes a list of 2,431 charter schools as well as analyses of enrollment and growth, and a ranking of state laws. 
PEOPLE: Everett Ehrlich has been named senior vice president and director of research at the Committee for Economic Development. Ehrlich, a former undersecretary of commerce for economic affairs, has also served as assistant director at the Congressional Budget Office, and is a former vice president for Unisys Corp. In his spare time, he pens novels. 
The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace has hired George Perkovich, a specialist in South Asian security issues, as a senior associate. Perkovich, author of a well-received book on Indian nuclear policy, has spent the last decade grant-making at the W. Alton Jones Foundation. Council on Foreign Relations scholar and former State Department policy planning head Morton Halperin has taken over the directorship of the Washington office of George Soros's Open Society Institute. 
Ross Eisenbrey has joined the Economic Policy Institute as policy director. He comes from the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission, where he was a commissioner, and has worked on labor issues in both the House and Senate.

Back in the late 1950s, a lawyer called Louis Kelso co-authored a book called The Capitalist Manifesto. In it, he posited that democracy suffered when money was confined to the hands of the wealthy. Workers should have a chance to participate in capital, not just in some nominal fashion but as true shareholders. 
With the Enron collapse on the front pages, and much media attention paid to the many employees who lost the bulk of their life savings because their retirement funds contained little other than Enron stock, Mr. Kelso's lessons for us bear revisiting.
The essence of property, as Mr. Kelso wrote, "is the right to receive its product." Workers needed equity assets and, crucially, the freedom to manage them. After this radical change, the United States would stabilize and would no longer suffer periods like that of Mr. Kelso's own youth, the Great Depression. 
Mr. Kelso created a device to mount his revolution: the employee stock ownership plan, Esop. A Kelsonian spirit also infused the subsequent development of the now widespread employee pension plan, the 401(k), an RSP-like vehicle. 
The 401(k) gives companies the option -- it is important to note this is voluntary -- to deposit company shares or cash into accounts of individual employees. Tax incentives then encourage workers to match the company contribution made in their name with their own cash savings. There are also confiscatory penalties for those who do not wait until retirement to claim the proceeds. 
All this comes to mind when we consider the fate of Enron employees who lost their 401(k) shirts when the Enron stock they held evaporated. One could argue -- from the left -- that the Enron case shows worker stock ownership is inherently dangerous. But the truth is that Enron's pension crisis occurred because 401(k)s are not Kelsonian enough. 
Consider the nature of 401(k)s. While workers have nominal title to their pensions while they are employed, both the government and company sponsors place all sorts of constraints on their ownership. In 401(k) plans, worker investments are routinely limited to an array of mutual funds, chosen by the company, and to company shares. They may not invest their 401(k) money in assets that are not on the prescribed menu, such as individual properties. They are, as mentioned, subject to rules that punish any withdrawals before retirement. What is more, pension law encourages employers to play the murky role of principal investment "educator" to employees. Many of these rules were written in the name of protecting the workers. But the net result is that, during the working years, the rights of ownership of 401(k) plans do not reside with the worker alone. Instead, they are shared between him and his employer. Worker ownership has generated enormous good, just as Mr. Kelso foresaw. 
The existence of Esops and 401(k)s in the 1980s and 1990s meant that workers could participate in great economic expansions. The fact that companies could offer their own stock to workers meant that they shared out far more than they might otherwise have done. 
The second benefit of employee stock ownership was that it did indeed give workers a personal stake in their companies. Companies figured out that worker-owners would be less likely to shirk. This is one reason why U.S. productivity growth stands out internationally. But Enron illustrates the disadvantages of the half-ownership arrangement. 
First is the problematic rule that drives employers to play the role of investment educator. This creates a form of pension paternalism that in turn generates a false sense of security. If Enron employees had been talking to an independent financial planner instead of their go-go bosses, that planner would have told them that it was crazy to have 98% of their pension in Enron stock. The advisor would also have told them that their Enron pension plans were insufficient. He or she would have said it was unwise for middle-aged workers to be taking the same risks as 20-year-olds at Internet start-ups. 
The second problem was a rule that gave Enron -- and other such firms -- the discretion to enforce a "black-out" period when workers are not allowed to alter their investments. Just such a black-out was in effect when Enron stock price was plummeting. This denied workers the right of the true owners to, receive their capital's product, as Mr. Kelso put it. If they had been able to do so, they could have sold the shares in a timely manner. 
The third problem rule is one that gave Enron the discretion to block sales by workers until they reached a certain age. Had workers truly controlled their capital, they would have been free to act more quickly. The logical next step therefore is to unmuddy the pension law and make clear what ownership is and what it is not. 
If employees are to have 401(k) investments -- and they should -- their ownership should be something closer to outright. The law should encourage them to seek independent advisers and to cast a skeptical eye on their employers' enthusiasms. The worst thing would be to heap on new constraints and "protections," as legislation proposed by senators Barbara Boxer and Jon Corzine would do. This would stop companies from contributing to these voluntary plans altogether. 
Most important to recall, at this dire moment, is that the profit-sharing ideal did achieve its lofty aim. For the tens of thousands of Enron workers in trouble, there are millions more who have seen benefits. It would do more damage than a dozen Enrons to disturb the progress of Louis Kelso's revolution.

The Worst Thing About Enron: Checks and Balances Failed

Enron was supposed to be the next new thing, a new-economy company with substance to it. 
Unlike flaky Internet start-ups that substituted ethereal yardsticks such as "eyeballs" and "stickiness" for revenue and profits, Enron had real businesses, real assets, real revenue and what seemed to be real profits. It owned natural gas pipelines and electric generating plants and water companies.
Not only would it do well, it would improve the planet by substituting the efficient hand of the market for the clumsy hand of government regulation. And it seemed to work. From humble beginnings as a natural gas company, Enron rose in a mere 15 years to No. 7 on the Fortune 500 list, doing $100 billion of business in 2000. Along the way, Enron became one of America's most admired companies and a perennial favorite on best-places-to-work lists. 
But Enron turned out to be another bubble. Unlike a Pets.com or a Webvan, whose implosions did little damage outside of costing dice-rolling speculators some money and techies some jobs, the Enron bubble exploded like a grenade. Today, Enron is a smoking ruin, the biggest corporate bankruptcy filing in American history. 
A year ago, the stock market valued Enron at more than $60 billion. Its stock has since lost 99 percent of its value -- and still seems overpriced. Stockholders and lenders are out tens of billions of dollars. Many of Enron's 20,000 employees lost their retirement savings when the company collapsed. About 5,000 of them, from computer jocks in Houston to newsprint recyclers in New Jersey, lost their jobs, too. 
By contrast, Chairman Ken Lay made $205 million in stock-option profits in the past four years alone, and other big hitters and board members made out, too. What's especially galling is that a handful of executives and outsiders made millions by investing in off-balance-sheet deals with Enron that played a large role in destroying the company. 
The collateral damage keeps spreading. Prominent among the wounded is Arthur Andersen, Enron's outside auditing firm, which disclosed last week that some employees destroyed documents. Andersen's reputation has been tarnished to the point that the Big Five accounting firms might shrink to the Big Four. Wall Street's credibility has been shattered. Utilities deregulation, for which Enron was the model, is now on the back burner. 
The spectacle of impoverished, unemployed Enron workers has thrown a harsh spotlight on the risks of 401(k) accounts stuffed with company stock. Confidence in financial markets has been shaken -- and rightly so. With the action in Afghanistan slowing down, Enron shock waves have finally reached Washington, raising the specter of another 'Gate. 
Life would be simple if we could blame the whole thing on Enron Chairman Lay. Or on George W. Bush, who goes way back with Lay, the biggest individual contributor to Bush's presidential and Texas gubernatorial campaigns. But Enron isn't that simple. It's something far more scary: a wholesale systemic failure. 
The multi-layered system of checks and balances that is supposed to keep a company from running amok completely broke down. Executives of public companies have legal and moral responsibilities to produce honest books and records -- but at Enron, they didn't do that. Outside auditors are supposed to make sure that a company's financial reports not only meet the letter of accounting rules but also give investors and lenders a fair and accurate picture of what's going on -- but Arthur Andersen failed that test. To protect themselves, lenders are supposed to make sure borrowers are creditworthy -- but Enron's lenders were as clueless as everyone else. Wall Street analysts are supposed to dig through company numbers to divine what's really happening -- but almost none of them managed to do that. Regulators didn't regulate. Enron's board of directors didn't direct. 
Why did all these people look the other way for so long? Money talks. Or, with Enron, shouts. The company put lots of money in the pockets of people and institutions who were supposed to police it. Enron's incessant dealmaking generated huge fees for Wall Street investment-banking houses. And guess what: Wall Street loved Enron, with most analysts rating its stock and bonds as the greatest thing since money was invented, at least until they finally heard Enron's death rattle. 
Enron paid huge fees -- $52 million in 2000 -- to Arthur Andersen for auditing and consulting services. Andersen allowed it to get away with accounting that was at best aggressive and at worst criminal. If Andersen had stood on principle, Enron would doubtless have changed accountants. 
Enron famously made heavy political contributions. Pols got peanuts compared with what Wall Street and Andersen got, but it was enough to help Enron run over regulators at both the national and state levels. 
The Enron fallout promises to be severe and far-reaching. With a criminal investigation underway, some of the Enron players face the possibility of spending time in the Big House. The only questions about Arthur Andersen is how much the partners will have to pay to settle this mess and whether the company can survive as an independent entity. The accounting profession is wishing it were again faceless and colorless, instead of being in the harsh spotlight. Financial conglomerates such as J.P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup are going to be scrutinized over their multiple and often conflicting roles at Enron: lenders, trading partners, investors, advisers, investment bankers. 
The bottom line: Enron wanted to change the world. It did. But not quite the way that it had in mind.

Scene: The executive conference room of Megaglom-Inflato Inc. 
Cast: The chairman of Megaglom-Inflato and a senior partner of the accounting firm Alfred Arthursen. 
Megaglom Chairman (seated at conference table, head in hands, weeping): "Woe is me! For I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of people of unclean lips!" 
Alfred Arthursen Senior Partner: "Nonsense, nonsense, now, now, come, come, chin up, stiff lip, all is not lost, no fear."

Watchdogs and Lapdogs
By Burton Malkiel

01/16/2002
The Wall Street Journal
A16
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

The bankruptcy of Enron -- at one time the seventh-largest company in the U.S. -- has underscored the need to reassess not only the adequacy of our financial reporting systems but also the public watchdog mission of the accounting industry, Wall Street security analysts, and corporate boards of directors. While the full story of what caused Enron to collapse has yet to be revealed, what is clear is that its accounting statements failed to give investors a complete picture of the firm's operations as well as a fair assessment of the risks involved in Enron's business model and financing structure. 
Enron is not unique. Incidents of accounting irregularities at large companies such as Sunbeam and Cendant have proliferated. As Joe Berardino, CEO of Arthur Andersen, said on these pages, "Our financial reporting model is broken. It is out of date and unresponsive to today's new business models, complex financial structures, and associated business risks."
It is important to recognize that losses suffered by Enron's shareholders took place in the context of an enormous bubble in the "new economy" part of the stock market during 1999 and early 2000. Stocks of Internet-related companies were doubling, then doubling again. Past standards of valuation like "buy stocks priced at reasonable multiples of earnings" had given way to blind faith that any company associated with the Internet was bound to go up. Enron was seen as the perfect "new economy" stock that could dominate the market for energy, communications, and electronic trading and commerce. 
I have sympathy for the Enron workers who came before Congress to tell of how their retirement savings were wiped out as Enron's stock collapsed and how they were constrained from selling. I have long argued for broad diversification in retirement portfolios. But many of those who suffered were more than happy to concentrate their portfolios in Enron stock when it appeared that the sky was the ceiling. 
Moreover, for all their problems, our financial reporting systems are still the world's gold standard, and our financial markets are the fairest and most transparent. But the dramatic collapse of Enron and the rapid destruction of $60 billion of market value has shaken public trust in the safeguards that exist to protect the interests of individual investors. Restoring that confidence, which our capital markets rely on, is an urgent priority. 
In my view, the root systemic problem is a series of conflicts of interest that have spread through our financial system. If there is one reliable principle of economics, it is that individual behavior is strongly influenced by incentives. Unfortunately, often the incentives facing accounting firms, security analysts, and even in some circumstances boards of directors militate against their functioning as effective guardians of shareholders' interests. 
While I will concentrate on the conflicts facing the accounting profession, perverse incentives also compromise the integrity of much of the research product of Wall Street security analysts. Many of the most successful research analysts are compensated largely on their ability to attract investment banking clients. In turn, corporations select underwriters partly on their ability to present positive analyst coverage of their businesses. Security analysts can get fired if they write unambiguously negative reports that might damage an existing investment banking relationship or discourage a prospective one. 
Small wonder that only about 1% of all stocks covered by street analysts have "sell" recommendations. Even in October 2001, 16 out of 17 securities analysts covering Enron had "buy" or "strong buy" ratings on the stock. As long as the incentives of analysts are misaligned with the needs of investors, Wall Street cannot perform an effective watchdog function. 
In some cases, boards of directors have their own conflicts. Too often, board members have personal, business, or consulting relationships with the corporations on whose boards they sit. For some "professional directors," large fees and other perks may militate against performing their proper function as a sometime thorn in management's side. Our watchdogs often behave like lapdogs. 
But it is on the independent accounting profession that we most rely for assurance that a corporation's financial statements accurately reflect the firm's condition. While we cannot expect independent auditors to detect all fraud, we should expect we can rely on them for integrity of financial reporting. While public accounting firms do have reputations to maintain and legal liability to avoid, the incentives of these firms and general auditing practices can sometimes combine to cloud the transparency of financial statements. 
In my own experience on several audit committees of public companies, the audit fee was only part of the total compensation paid to the public accounting firm hired to examine the financial statements. Even after the divestiture of their consulting units, revenues from tax and management advisory services comprise a large share of the revenues of the "Big Five" accounting firms. In some cases auditing services may be priced as a "loss leader" to allow the accounting firm to gain access to more lucrative non-audit business. 
In such a situation, the audit partner may be loath to make too much of a fuss about some gray area of accounting if the intransigence is likely to jeopardize a profitable relationship for the accounting firm. Indeed, audit partners are often compensated by how much non-audit business they can capture. They may be incentivized, then, to overlook some particularly aggressive accounting treatment suggested by their clients. 
Outside auditors also frequently perform and review the inside audit function within the corporation, as was the case with Andersen and Enron. Such a situation may weaken the safeguards that exist when two independent organizations examine complicated transactions. It's as if a professor let students grade their own papers and then had the responsibility to hear any appeals. Auditors may also be influenced by the prospect of future employment with their clients. 
Unfortunately, our existing self-regulatory and standard-setting organizations fall short. The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants has neither the resources nor the power to be fully effective. The institute may even have contributed to the problem by encouraging auditors to "leverage the audit" into advising and consulting services. 
The Financial Accounting Standards Board has often emphasized the correct form by which individual transactions should be reported rather than the substantive way in which the true risk of the firm may be obscured. Take "Special Purpose Entities," for example, the financing vehicles that permit companies such as Enron to access capital and increase leverage without adding debt to the balance sheet. Even if all of Enron's SPEs had met the narrow test for balance sheet exclusion (which, in fact, they did not), our accounting standard would not have illuminated the effective leverage Enron had undertaken and the true risks of the enterprise. 
Given the complexity of modern business and the way it is financed, we need to develop a new set of accounting standards that can give an accurate picture of the business as a whole. FASB may have helped us measure the individual trees but it has not developed a way to give us a clear picture of the forest. The continued integrity of the financial reporting system and our capital markets must be insured. We need to modernize our accounting system so financial statements give a clearer picture of what assets and liabilities on the balance sheet are at risk. And we must find ways to lessen the conflicts facing auditors, security analysts, and even boards of directors that undermine checks and balances our capital markets rely on. 
One possibility is to require that auditing firms be changed periodically the way audit partners within each firm are rotated. This would incentivize auditors to be particularly careful in approving accounting transactions for fear that leniency would be exposed by later auditors. 
And, in the end, we need to create a powerful and effective self-regulatory organization with credible disciplinary authority to enforce accounting rules and standards. It would be far better for the industry to respond itself to the current crises than to await the likelihood that the political process will do so for them.

Re "Officials Defend Not Sounding Alarm on Enron," Jan. 14: Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and Commerce Secretary Don Evans should be allowed to state under oath that they did not tell the president of Enron's pending bankruptcy. This was Dubya's moneybag--past, present and future--and they didn't think it important enough to inform him? 
That is not credible. The last presidential election was ugly. The next one should be worse.

O'Neill's contention that "I don't go across the street and tell the president every time somebody calls me" is about the weakest defense I've heard in my life. One of the largest corporations in the world is saying it is in trouble and needs help from the U.S. government and O'Neill doesn't even call President Bush? 
[Enron Corp. Chairman] Kenneth Lay is a close friend of the Bush family and O'Neill doesn't call Bush? Is it possible Bush might have been watching "Fox News Sunday" on Sunday and not a football game when he choked on that pretzel? 
Dave Gunall 
Ventura 
* 
O'Neill describes the theft of thousands of hard-working, loyal workers' jobs and retirement funds by a small handful of far-wealthier men as "part of the genius of capitalism." If despicable corporate behavior such as Enron-gate continues to be ignored and condoned (only after being exposed, of course) by our highest government officials, aren't we being told that crime does indeed pay? If you're running a corporation, that is. 
Why do we have thousands upon thousands of petty, two-bit criminals behind bars, many for doing drugs that only harmed themselves, while people like Lay and his higher rungs get awarded "genius" status when they've just ruined thousands of lives and made off with their loot? O'Neill's callous remark, further evidence of the true pro-business/anti-worker nature of our suddenly beloved president who appointed him, offers us another shining, some would say genius, example of "compassionate conservatism."

The Bush administration attempted to distance itself from the Enron disaster by turning a deaf ear to requests for help from high Enron officials. The fear was that any government involvement would appear to be integral to the cozy relationship between Enron and Bush administration officials. Had this relationship not existed, prompt government action (as was done in the cases of Chrysler, Lockheed and Long-Term Capital Management) might have staved off an Enron bankruptcy and thereby mitigated the consequences to Enron employees and investors.

Re "Enron Way: Anything but 'Simple, Straightforward,' " Commentary, Jan. 13: I think there's a perfectly straightforward and simple answer to this mess. Freeze every bank account belonging to the Enron executives who sold all their stock at tremendous profit. Then pay back the employees who weren't allowed to cash their stocks and who lost their pensions and 401(k)s from this money. 
Then, give the Enron executives and the Andersen auditors ("Auditor Says It Destroyed Enron Records," Jan. 11) what they deserve--nice long prison sentences. Simple.

To the Editor: 
Quite apart from any question of political corruption, the Enron story stands as a symbol of the kind of society that I thought we had left behind many years ago (''Minimizing the Enron Taint,'' editorial, Jan. 12). Entrepreneurs assure profits for themselves while investors are cheated and workers are left with next to nothing.
This debacle should remind us that government has a role in restraining individuals who abuse the market for their own interests and in protecting those subject to economic forces beyond their control.

In ''Minimizing the Enron Taint'' (editorial, Jan. 12), you imply that ''any action by the government'' on behalf of Enron would have been inappropriate given the perception that it was a favor for campaign contributions.
But it may be that such action to stem the economic calamity caused by Enron's bankruptcy was called for. The ability of government to act without fear of ethical impropriety is another reason for campaign finance reform banning soft money from corporations.

I am concerned that the Democrats, in their desire to impute scandal to the Bush administration in the Enron matter, may overlook the real political message of this debacle (''Parties Weigh Political Price of Enron's Fall,'' front page, Jan. 12). 
Enron was the administration's model corporation. It operated aggressively in a lightly regulated environment, and its financial practices were secretive and obfuscatory.
The Bush tax cuts replicate this model. If the cuts are not repealed, the country will experience an Enron-like disaster on a vast scale.

To the Editor: 
Enron spread its financial largess to the candidates of both major political parties to promote policies to get government off the backs of the energy sector. How ironic that the same erstwhile champion of deregulation repeatedly called high government officials and sought their help for some kind of financial bailout (front page, Jan. 12).

The Real Lessons of Enron's Fall

To the Editor: 
Despite the tone-deaf remark by Paul H. O'Neill, the treasury secretary, that the collapse of Enron reflects ''the genius of capitalism,'' the Bush administration does not appear to have done anything illegal. As Bob Herbert suggests (column, Jan. 14), the laws themselves are scandalous. 
The real travesty of the Enron collapse is not the failure of administration officials to notify small-time investors of what Enron's fat cats knew: it is in corporate control over employee 401(k) investments and laws governing the corrupt campaign finance system.
Rather than wasting energy trying to pin a scandal on President Bush now, why not seize this opportunity to change the laws that let companies buy access to top officials and allow companies to force employees to keep their savings in a tanking stock while executives cash in? 
If Congress refuses to act, we should all be scandalized.

POINT OF VIEW: Beyond Enron, A Wider Crisis Of Confidence
By Michael Rapoport

A Dow Jones Newswires Column 
(This report was originally published Tuesday.) 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) has a lot to answer for. And it may be even more than you might realize at first.
Already the rippling scandal has claimed a long list of victims - from the thousands of Enron employees who've seen their retirement savings wiped out to the reputation of Arthur Andersen LLP, Enron's beleaguered auditor. 
But what may turn out to be the most far-reaching effect of the Enron scandal is more amorphous and less obvious. Simply put, the problem is this: After Enron, and after conflicts of interest and earnings tricks at other companies that have shaken the confidence of investors over the past couple of years, who can investors trust? 
Because of these happenings, investors are going through "a crisis in confidence like I've never seen before," said Pat McConnell, an accounting analyst for Bear Stearns & Co. Their faith in something as basic as the accuracy of financial statements has been eroded, she said - and "that's not a good and healthy thing." 
Enron, after all, amounts to a poster child for a lot of what's been wrong with the market in recent years. Manipulation of financial statements to make the company look like it's in better shape than it really is? Check. Aiding and abetting in its misdeeds, apparently, by an auditor who may have been more concerned about its fees than in the accuracy of the figures it was auditing? Check. Fawning praise from stock analysts too lazy or too conflicted to raise the questions about the company's business that should have been raised? Check. 
As a result, investors feel a little like the rug has been pulled out from under them. They've had enough, said McConnell, who spoke Thursday in New York at a Directors' Roundtable seminar on how companies should report their earnings. With their confidence damaged, she said, there's "a lot of skepticism" among investors about the information they're being given. 
This lack of confidence has all kinds of effects, none of them favorable. For one thing, McConnell noted, it increases the cost of capital for companies: If investors don't feel they can trust in the accuracy of the information they use to make investment decisions, they're going to demand a bigger return on their investments to compensate. 
And look at what's happened to Tyco International Inc. (TYC). The SEC closed an accounting probe of Tyco in 2000 without taking any action, and the company insists that everything is on the up-and-up - and yet persistent investor skepticism about Tyco's accounting has weighed on the stock in recent days. Investors no longer know who to believe. 
This slippage in investor confidence in the most basic of the market's underpinnings is worrisome, and it should be a wake-up call. It should concern every company out there that's tried to game the figures to paste a smiley face on its financial condition, and every auditor and analyst who's helped them do it. 
Because if investors' confidence slips too far, the market is going to suffer some damage that it's going to be hard to recover from. A free market is built on the free and equitable distribution of information in whose accuracy investors can trust when using it to make financial decisions. Without that accuracy and that trust, we might as well be Argentina.

THE WORLD World Press Tries to Unknot Tale of Bush and the Pretzel Reaction: Some papers are skeptical or sarcastic. Others delve into the history of the salty snack.

LONDON -- Was it an Al Qaeda plot? An Enron end run? Or was it, as President Bush said, just a wayward pretzel that briefly felled the leader of the free world? 
With the only witnesses to the presidential fainting spell two canines, the international press has been left to speculate about what happened and whether Bush can watch TV and chew pretzels at the same time.
"George Bush attempted to taste the biscuit with his attention focused on a football game--a combination of actions that, it appears, proved difficult," said the Greek daily To Vima. 
The media responded to the pretzel pratfall with jokes, queries about Bush's mental and physical health and detailed explanations of the knotted American-style pretzel. 
"Though not to everyone's taste, they are not considered a health hazard," London's Independent newspaper informed readers dryly. 
True to form, the Germans consulted pretzel experts, the French contemplated Americans' "complicated relationship with food," and the Italians looked to the religious roots of the pretzel. The Saudis worried that the scare will prevent Bush from focusing attention on Israel's oppression of the Palestinians, while Britons offered Bush a few backhanded compliments. 
The incident proved Bush is "a man of the people," London's Daily Telegraph said in an editorial. "This is exactly the sort of accident that befalls Homer Simpson, night after night." 
The conservative paper noted in its news pages that the president "was not eating something foreign or in any way fancy when he passed out." The paper was cheered by the fact that the leader of the international war on terrorism still has time for Sunday football. "He has shown himself, once again, to be completely in tune with the tastes and instincts of the people he leads," its editorial said. 
Of course, most Americans didn't end up prone with facial bruises at the end of the game--at least not from pretzels. The Independent labeled the official story "Hard to Swallow." 
"Was he poisoned perhaps? Has the stress of fighting the war on terrorism while fending off inquiries about the collapse of his friend Ken Lay's Enron overwhelmed him? Was there maybe some family tiff?" the paper asked in an editorial. It concluded that "the vanquisher of Al Qaeda may have met his match." 
Germany's mass-circulation Bild, the daily of choice for blue-collar Germans, also asked if there wasn't more to the story: "Has the president's alcohol problem been taken up again?" 
Expressing concern for the president's health, Saudi Arabia's English-language Arab News said that while no one believes there is anything seriously wrong with Bush, his pretzel mishap has led to speculation about the impact of an ailing president on the world. 
"These are particularly dangerous times internationally. The United States has assumed considerable responsibilities and powers in its campaign against global terrorism. In order to bring together a coalition of support within the Arab world, the White House had to focus its attention more constructively on Israel's oppression of the Palestinians," the paper said in an editorial. 
"If, however, Bush's unusual collapse is a symptom of more serious medical problems, we can be absolutely sure that, lacking any clear direction from a troubled White House, Washington's foreign policy will click back on its traditional Zionist track. Palestinians will continue to choke on Israeli aggression while the U.S. president may again choke on a typical Yiddish pretzel," it said. 
No, no, said the Italian press. The American-style pretzel was invented by a 16th century German monk as a reward for children who memorized their prayers, La Repubblica newspaper said. The word derives from the Latin prex, or prize, it said. 
Leave it to the British tabloids to challenge the Italians on Latin. London's Daily Mail declared that the word "pretzel" comes from pretiola--Latin for "little reward." The dough is folded to look like a child's arms in prayer, and the three holes represent Christianity's holy Trinity. And it was German and Dutch immigrants who took the pretzel across the Atlantic when they settled in Pennsylvania in 1710, the paper said. 
Pretzel is brezel in Germany, where the Berliner Morgenpost sought out the opinion of a master baker on the safety of the U.S. snack food--and the likelihood that it could have caused the president's swoon. 
"I have no reason to doubt the quality of the American pretzel," opined Eberhard Groebel, speculating that Bush's spell was due to his ignoring "the 50-gram rule." That is a German etiquette adage that holds that one should not try to talk with more than 1.75 ounces of food in one's mouth. 
"Even in his wildest dreams, Osama bin Laden couldn't have managed what one tiny pretzel did this weekend," began a story in the Berliner Zeitung daily. "According to reports from the White House, it not only brought the mightiest man in the world to his knees but flat out on the floor." 
Spain's national daily, ABC, reported that after an exhaustive investigation, the FBI, CIA and Secret Service had "rejected [the possibility] that the biscuit in question came from Afghanistan and have certified that it is a genuine American salted pretzel." 
Russian newspapers, perhaps reflecting the more somber tone of the Vladimir V. Putin era, restrained themselves. The daily Komsomolskaya Pravda ran a detailed diagram of Bush's anatomy, with the location of the pretzel blockage marked with a star. 
"Bush's organism, although weakened and unconscious, managed to cope with the indisposition," wrote the daily Gazeta. "The organism first rejected the pretzel but later swallowed it and digested without mercy." 
Ah, but Bush shouldn't be overconfident, the French and British press warned. 
"This shows that the most powerful man on Earth is, above all, a man," wrote the Lyons newspaper Le Progres. "And as a man, he is in danger of digging his grave with his teeth. . . . Especially when he comes from a society that obviously has a complicated relationship with food." 
Added London's Mirror tabloid: "Attila the Hun survived bloody battles only to die of a nosebleed on his wedding night. Sir Francis Bacon wanted to prove frozen food lasted longer and went outside to stuff a chicken with snow. The experiment was a success, but he died of pneumonia."

Former Enron Corp. employees hawking items from bankrupt company in Internet auction
By KRISTEN HAYS
Associated Press Writer

HOUSTON (AP) - Former Enron Corp. employees are hawking dozens of company items on Internet auctions, including the embattled company's 64-page code of ethics and a commemorative stock certificate. 
Former Enron employee Matt Mitchell is selling one of his two copies of a broadband risk management manual used by the former energy giant, which contains tips on increasing creditworthiness and timing of reported earnings. It is among the priciest of more than 100 Enron-related items for sale in eBay auctions.
"It's not entirely deceptive, but it isn't showing what's actually happening," Mitchell said Tuesday of risk management techniques employees learned from the manual, which he hopes to sell for at least $150. The auction ends Friday. 
Other items for sale on the site range from freebies that Enron gave employees, such as golf balls, baseball hats and paperweights with the company logo. 
Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said former employees can sell Enron artifacts with the company's blessing. 
"The whole situation is unfortunate, and we've always had resourceful, innovative employees. This is just the latest demonstration," she said. 
Mitchell, 29, was among hundreds of employees laid off from Enron's money-losing broadband services unit in July last year, six months before 4,500 lost their jobs in December after Enron filed the largest bankruptcy in history. He worked as a sales engineer for Enron for 14 months, consulting with traders who made telecommunications-related trades. 
Mitchell found another job for less pay with a small software company in Houston in September and watched his former employer implode in a whirlwind of questionable accounting practices, deflated shares and erosion of investor and trader confidence. Stock that traded near $80 a year ago was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday, having stagnated at less than $1 for weeks. 
Mitchell said he thought the risk management manual might generate a snicker or two and pique interest from some bidders. He said risk management techniques used for energy and electricity trading were tweaked to apply to broadband in the manuals. 
"This was just old information rewritten," Mitchell said. "It does not go into specific laws about what you can do with taxes and ownership, but there are cases of where it focuses on what you can do and accepted accounting practices that are allowed." 
For example, the manual said companies can re-categorize expenses "in such a manner as to improve the perceived financial performance." 
Mitchell said layoffs were common for broadband employees working for an unprofitable venture, but they benefited from the company's severance plan. 
Those laid off after the bankruptcy filing received $4,500 each, as approved by a U.S. bankruptcy judge in New York. Mitchell received nearly $40,000 as entitled under company policy, as did others laid off before Enron's demise. 
"I was one of the lucky ones," Mitchell said. "I was lucky enough to get another job, with a substantial pay cut, in September. I feel worse for all my co-workers, who had no notice whatsoever and no idea it was coming."

The Man behind the Deal Machine.
As creator of iffy Enron partnerships, ousted CFO Andrew Fastow is a prime target for investigators

When it comes to Andrew S. Fastow, the former Enron Chief Financial Officer, there's one thing those who worked with him agree on: He never appeared anything but supremely self-confident. Early in his career at Enron, when Fastow was just another bright young executive at the energy company, he bargained relentlessly to win a concession from a banker. Afterward, Fastow thanked him and said: ``I'll remember that when I'm CFO.'' 
Now, some see Fastow's cockiness as one factor behind Enron's collapse into the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history. Certainly he wasn't the only top executive at Enron with that kind of attitude; the word most people use to describe the company culture is arrogant. But Fastow was one of the few whose aggressive tactics and overconfidence had the capacity to turn dangerous for the company.
If former CEO Jeffrey K. Skilling was the architect behind Enron's transformation from stodgy pipeline to high-tech trading powerhouse, Fastow was the trusted lieutenant who created the increasingly complex and unusual off-balance-sheet financing that fueled Enron's growth. He was also key in selling the deals to banks and institutional investors--sometimes with veiled threats and sometimes with sweet talk, say those familiar with his tactics. ``He had a dual personality. He could be charming but he could also be irrationally mean,'' says one high-ranking insider. 
As congressional investigators, the Securities & Exchange Commission, the Justice Dept., and shareholders' lawyers try to pin down the culprits in Enron's demise, Fastow, 40, has fast become one of the primary targets. He devised the LJM partnerships that triggered the controversy over Enron's accounting. His lawyers stress that the LJM partnerships, which Fastow ran and had stakes in, were approved by top management and the board. They also note that Fastow had no oversight of the accounting for these deals--that was the responsibility of another Enron executive who did not report to him. Fastow spokesman Gordon G. Andrew says that ``Enron senior management had full knowledge of the LJM transactions.'' But some former and current Enron executives believe that Fastow may have hidden some aspects of the partnerships--including the involvement of other insiders--from Chairman Kenneth L. Lay and Skilling. 
To many colleagues and bankers who knew him, it is easy to draw Fastow as one of the villains in this story. Insiders saw him as sometimes volatile and vindictive, determined to get to the top by pleasing Skilling. That meant putting together creative financial structures that ensured Enron could expand its business without adding too much new debt to the balance sheet or threatening its crucial credit rating. But Fastow's desire to follow Skilling's lead didn't end there. To build his new home in the exclusive River Oaks section of Houston--where construction continues despite Fastow's troubles--he hired the same architect Skilling had used, says a source familiar with the project. Some at Enron even came to believe that Fastow named his first son, Jeffrey, after Skilling--a contention denied by Fastow's wife through a friend. ``I don't think Andy ever did anything that Jeff didn't tell him to do,'' says one former co-worker. Adds another high-level insider: ``He wanted to make Jeff happy.'' 
Former colleagues say Fastow's screaming, table-pounding style suited the aggressive Skilling. And Fastow's penchant for belittling co-workers certainly didn't hinder his climb to the top. ``He loved to make people look stupid,'' says one Enron executive. ``He seemed to do it most when he was in front of a lot of people.'' Some former co-workers say he often remembered personal slights or grudges when it came time for performance reviews; at Enron, the top managers could offer their evaluations of anyone, even those who didn't report to them. 
The aggressiveness was all in service to Skilling's plan to transform Enron into a fast-growth, technology-oriented trading company: the company of the future. When Fastow joined Enron's finance group in 1990, the company, and the energy industry in general, were still considered backwaters for bright young MBAs. Skilling was determined to change all that; even then he was pushing Enron to take advantage of the newly deregulated energy business. Fastow clearly sensed opportunity. And his wife Lea hailed from the wealthy Weingarten realty and grocery family in Houston, so he was eager to move to Enron's hometown. Lea, an MBA who had also worked at Continental Illinois Bank in Chicago, joined Enron, too, in the treasury department. She left the company in early 1997. 
Fastow and Skilling quickly became partners in the effort to reshape Enron, and Skilling looked to Fastow to help develop the financing that would fuel the growth of his empire. At first, the off-balance-sheet financings created by Fastow and his group were not particularly risky, say bankers familiar with the deals. Early ones were backed by payments from oil and gas producers. But before too long, they say, Enron began using its growing clout to include in the deals a hodgepodge of assets, some of dubious quality, and a range of unusual provisions. One banker recalls a partnership that had very few restrictions on what energy assets Enron could put in; his bank eventually started turning some of the deals down. Another banker was stunned by an on-balance-sheet financing that was to be backed up by third-party receivables. The problem was that Enron also included the right to replace the receivables with its own paper, which is now almost worthless. That deal was code-named Tammy, after Tammy Faye Bakker, and included her picture on the tombstone presented to participating bankers. As the banker recalls: ``I said, `Is it that ugly?''' 
So why did so many bankers go along? Most didn't want to miss the Enron gravy train. One Houston banker estimates that Fastow controlled some $80 million to $100 million in annual fees for a wide variety of banking and investment banking services. Reluctance to join an Enron deal or persistent questioning about the terms would lead to threats that they'd be cut out of future business, some bankers say. To help in its arm-twisting, Enron kept an internal spreadsheet listing which banks were in which deals and what they made. Fastow and his team would also sell their deals by hinting that even these off-balance-sheet structures were somehow backed up by Enron, says one former banker who did business with the company. And Fastow could also turn on the charm: He delivered flowers to the house of one banker after his son's baptism. Fastow's spokesman denies that he ever threatened bankers to get them into Enron's deals. 
Fastow's hard-nosed business style doesn't square with the Andy that friends and acquaintances saw outside of the office. He was a major benefactor to the city's art museums, a fund-raiser for the local Holocaust Museum, and a co-founder of a synagogue. ``The Andy Fastow I know is one of the most thoughtful and generous people in Houston,'' says Robert E. Lapin, an attorney who is one of Fastow's closest friends. When one of Lapin's three children was diagnosed with a rare disease, Fastow was one of the first to call. ``He said, `You just tell me when and how you need help and I'll do it,''' says Lapin. Even old chums from New Providence (N.J.) High School recall Fastow as popular and well-liked, though extremely ambitious. He was the first permanent student representative to the New Jersey State Board of Education, for instance, a post he pushed to create. 
Now as friends and colleagues try to figure out how Fastow landed in the middle of one of the biggest financial scandals ever, that driving ambition is looking more and more like a liability.

Special Report: The Enron Scandal: INVESTIGATIONS
THE SWAMP FOX ON ENRON'S TAIL Is Billy Tauzin--a longtime accounting-industry pal--the right man to lead the Hill's charge?
By Dan Carney and Laura Cohn in Washington, D.C.

Representative W.J. ``Billy'' Tauzin, the affable Republican chairman of the House Energy & Commerce Committee, once observed of his home state of Louisiana that ``half of it is underwater. And the other half is under indictment.'' That pretty much sums up Tauzin: wickedly funny, disarmingly candid, and--given some of the politicians Louisiana has produced--painfully on the mark. 
Sometimes called the Cagey Cajun or the Swamp Fox for his droll humor and deft politics, Tauzin is a master at using his committee to full effect. While he's leading just one of 10 groups looking into the Enron Corp. mess, count on him to be at the center of the action as the investigations heat up. Thanks to his early acquisition of documents and digging, much of what has come to light in recent weeks--including the letter that Enron executive Sherron S. Watkins wrote last August to CEO Kenneth L. Lay warning of the company's impending collapse--has come from his team of 15 investigators.
The Enron probe won't be the first controversy to put Tauzin in the spotlight. Many of the highest profile congressional hearings of the past 18 months have been his doing. Remember the Ford-Firestone probe? That was his. The hearings into the election-night network-TV projections in Florida? Tauzin again. The California energy crisis? He was in the middle of that investigation, too. The explanation for his frequent forays? It's partly due to his committee's jurisdiction--and partly his own desire to be the showman. 
But Enron clearly puts Tauzin in an uncomfortable position. As he doggedly pursues the hottest story in business, the southern Louisiana lawyer has had to do a little backtracking of his own. Until now, he has been one of the most unabashed defenders of the accounting industry in Congress. He took $57,000 in campaign contributions from accounting firm Arthur Andersen over the past 12 years, more than any other House member. What's more, he was instrumental in defeating former Securities & Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr.'s efforts to clamp down on accounting industry conflicts of interest in late 2000. ``Today,'' he says rather sheepishly, ``it's kind of hard to say there isn't evidence of a problem.Arthur Levitt was right.'' 
It isn't the first time that Tauzin has dramatically reversed his position. Colleagues--some admiringly, some not--call him Congress' ``ultimate political chameleon.'' Indeed, the Cagey Cajun has changed his political stripes before, with no ill consequences. After the GOP took control of the House in 1995, he not only switched parties but also negotiated his way into a powerful subcommittee chairmanship. In one quick move, he managed to stay in the majority and cut in front of several lifelong Republicans to head the panel that oversees telecommunications. 
Tauzin's change of tune in the current controversy could have profound policy consequences. Once a staunch deregulator, he now vows a thorough look at how Big Business conducts itself. ``We're finding out that there are real problems endemic in the structure of Corporate America that we need to deal with,'' he told BusinessWeek. ``Enron is just the worst example.'' 
But can someone who has reversed positions and been closely tied to the accounting business convince the public that he is earnest in his efforts to police it? Many believe that while Tauzin is brilliant at political theater, he's unlikely to go to the mat for tough new accounting rules. ``Things like this make good television,'' says Bill Allison, managing editor of publications for the consumer watchdog group Center for Public Integrity. ``But I don't know that they're going to make good law.'' Furthermore, some critics observe that while Tauzin's talk is now tougher, he has no intention of giving back any of the industry donations he has received. 
Even so, voters back home give the congressman a lot of maneuvering room. He's adored in his district along the Mississippi Delta for his panache and his help for local business. As a result, he has run unopposed in most of his recent reelection races, as a Democrat or a Republican. Besides, as former Senator J. Bennett Johnston (D-La.) says: ``Consistency is the hobgoblin of small minds. And Tauzin does not have a small mind.'' 
Indeed, he's hoping to use those smarts to prove doubters wrong. Already, committee staffers have interviewed former Enron CEO Jeffrey K. Skilling; David B. Duncan, the recently-fired Andersen partner who handled the Enron account; as well as that firm's risk-management chief, Michael C. Odom. Tauzin is also negotiating to meet with former Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow, who managed and had stakes in some of the risky partnerships that caused the company to crater. 
But there is the potential for disappointment, too. He has set the stage for his own high-profile hearings by selectively releasing some of the tens of thousands of pages of Enron and Andersen documents his staffers have culled through, and his new challenge will be to deliver something more than headlines. Moreover, Tauzin must also take care not to do anything that would undercut the criminal probes undertaken by the Justice Dept. 
For now, though, Tauzin is playing it cool. While his staff was hunting through records over the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend, he was chasing deer in Alabama and keeping in touch with his crew via BlackBerry. ``He may be hunting deer,'' one staffer laughed, ``but he's got his dogs hunting Enron.'' After the upcoming hearings, Tauzin may have some more headlines for his scrapbook.

Special Report: The Enron Scandal
BRACING FOR A BACKLASH After Enron, business may be subjected to a new wave of regulation

During the 1990s boom, Americans had mixed views about the world of business. Most applauded the bounty produced by the U.S. economy, support for deregulation was on the upswing, and many rushed to grab a slice of the pie by investing in the rising stock market. For many, business simply became cool. Yet even with the bull market and the New Economy in full swing, a backlash began to build as many also grew angry at the perceived high-handedness of big corporations: the uncaring HMOs, the lousy airline and telephone service, the price-gouging drugmakers, and the sweatshops run by shoe and garment makers. 
Now the Enron Corp. scandal--coming on the heels of a sharp recession, a tumbling market, and an extended stretch during which many of the most vaunted business success stories of the late 1990s proved to be chimeras--threatens to push the anticorporate button all over again. True, two-thirds of Americans still think corporations make good products and compete well in the global economy, according to a BusinessWeek/Harris poll taken Jan. 16-21. Only a third, however, feel large companies have ethical business practices and just 26% believe they are straightforward and honest in their dealings with consumers and employees. ``The backlash is beginning,'' warned General Electric Co. Chief Executive Jeffrey R. Immelt at a talk with BusinessWeek Editor-in-Chief Stephen B. Shepard in New York on Jan. 15. ``Credibility and trust is everything [in business]. And because of the recession, because of Enron, that trust has evaporated.''
Will the public mood become increasingly at odds with big business and the culture of investing? Certainly, what's emerging is a political climate that appears much more open to government regulation than has been the case for years. A crackdown on the accounting industry seems likely. Board directors may get hit with new rules about conflict of interest, as well as new responsibilities to oversee corporate audits. Companies also could face restrictions on the ability to fund 401(k)s with their own stock. ``I worry that Enron will unleash a welter of restrictive new regulations,'' frets Steven A. Raymund, CEO of Tech Data Corp., a Clearwater (Fla.)-based computer distributor. 
Even campaign-finance reform could get a lift. After all, Enron's largesse with elected officials has left a widespread impression that it paid the cops on its beat to take a nap. ``The Enron scandal clearly shows that legislators were influenced by campaign donations and didn't live up to their watchdog duties,'' says David Clay, a veteran factory hand at Boeing Co.'s aircraft plant in Everett, Wash. 
Of course, public anger and political furor often have a way of fading quickly in Washington. Gun control looked like a no-brainer after the Columbine shootings, but wound up blocked by powerful groups such as the National Rifle Assn. Corporate lobbyists are already working hard to head off Enron-related regulation. The heat also is unlikely to affect many of the broader deregulatory efforts that have brought sweeping change to industries such as banking and telecommunications. 
Clearly there are signs of a growing disenchantment with business. While the BusinessWeek/Harris poll shows that a core 16% of Americans have ``a great deal of confidence'' in people running major companies--up slightly from the 15% who felt that way in 1999--the percentage who have ``hardly any'' confidence in business leaders nearly doubled to 24%, from 13% in 1999. 
Although there is no concrete evidence yet that Enron is adding to that disenchantment, many fear that the sordid tale will feed suspicions about self-dealing by executives and the nexus of influence between companies and politicians. The BusinessWeek/Harris poll finds that some 79% of Americans believe corporate executives put their own personal interests ahead of workers' and shareholders', as Enron officials are alleged to have done. Other polls find similar results. For example, a Gallup Organization poll released on Jan. 16 shows that 61% of those closely following the Enron story believe its executives did something illegal. Says Governor John G. Rowland (R-Conn.), head of the Republican Governors Assn.: ``The average guy on the street sees the Enron mess and says, `Oh, another corrupt corporation.''' 
Reformers are moving to capitalize on such attitudes. Reacting to the pension losses suffered by Enron employees, for example, pension-rights and labor groups have ambitious goals to give workers more control over 401(k) plans. Limiting the amount of employer stock in such plans is only the first step. The AFL-CIO also argues that 401(k)s should be governed like union pension funds, with boards comprising employees as well as company officials. Such independent oversight could resonate widely. ``There should be outside management of retirement funds,'' says Carol Otten, an assistant vice-president in the Chicago branch of Commerzbank, a Frankfurt-based bank. ``With the CEO not involved and no company stock in the fund, there wouldn't be this question of accountability'' raised by the Enron case. 
Other groups cite Enron as evidence of the need for new regulatory scrutiny of the big accounting firms. They argue that Andersen was lax because it got larger fees from consulting for Enron than from auditing the company's books. This is the rule in the industry, not an exception. In fact, the large accounting firms last year received just 28% of their aggregate fees from accounting, according to a study by the Investor Responsibility Research Center Inc., a nonprofit group in Washington that represents institutional investors. 
To remedy the problem, some investors want to limit or ban auditors from consulting for the companies they audit, although the SEC appears little inclined to go along. Others want to require corporations to change their accountants every seven years. ``Enron has given investors the weapon they've been waiting for to really make something happen,'' says Carol Bowie, the IRRC's head of governance research. 
In addition to reform groups, the pressure from skittish stock investors is having at least a short-term effect on some companies. For example, Kmart Corp.'s Jan. 22 bankruptcy filing was triggered in part by Enron-inspired fears. So was Tyco International Ltd.'s decision that day to split into four business units. Tyco CEO L. Dennis Kozlowski says he took the step to reassure the fast-growing conglomerate's investors that its complex financial reporting scheme involved no risky accounting--a move that wouldn't have been needed if the Enron meltdown hadn't renewed investor skepticism about its bookkeeping. 
The biggest political question is whether the Enron backlash will suffice to push through campaign-finance legislation. Substantial curbs on campaign contributions could have a big impact on the way Washington is run. However, that's exactly why opponents are likely to stall any key votes until the scandal has died down. 
The outcome of that battle could feed into the November elections as well. So far, there's no evidence that close ties to Enron executives led to any unethical actions by the Bush Administration on the company's behalf. But Democrats may try to use the opportunity to taint the President for his close association with Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay. More broadly, they may tap the antiregulatory mood to paint the GOP as captive supporters of unregulated corporate power. ``Obviously, that's the bigger political game here--to tie the Enron albatross around the necks of Republicans who believe that government should be less involved in markets,'' says Jerry Taylor, an environmental expert at the Cato Institute, a free-market think tank in Washington. 
Of course, 10 months is an eternity in politics. Events may simply push Enron out of the public consciousness long before autumn. Still, many average Americans were suspicious of both corporations and politicians before Enron came along. The company's collapse, and the open question as to whether the government will take steps to guard against future corporate meltdowns, can only add to the public's growing sense of cynicism and mistrust.

Finance: INSURANCE
RUNNING FOR COVERAGE Suddenly, policies to cover execs are growing scarce
By Heather Timmons in New York

02/04/2002
BusinessWeek

(Copyright 2002 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)

Buck naked. That's how many executives and company board members facing multimillion-dollar shareholder lawsuits may feel in the post-Enron era. Fearing an explosion of litigation over alleged executive misdeeds, insurers are retreating from writing Directors & Officers (D&O) policies to cover execs against court costs and fines if they are named in suits ranging from sexual harassment to insider trading. Insurers were already jittery about the growing number of dot-bomb class actions. Now the Enron Corp. debacle is ``making everyone in the business recognize the potential severity of D&O losses,'' says John Keogh, president and COO of National Union Fire Insurance Co., American International Group Inc.'s D&O unit. 
Less than a dozen companies--including AIG, Chubb, and Great American--underwrote 98% of such insurance in the U.S. in 2001. Eight insurers, including Aegis, Lloyd's of London, and St. Paul may face claims from Enron directors or officials. Aegis, as lead insurer, could be looking at $100 million alone. On Jan. 18, Enron asked the Manhattan bankruptcy judge to make its insurers advance cash to executives and directors for legal fees.
Even before Enron collapsed, all major D&O insurers in the U.S. were taking stock of the business. Lloyd's of London, the third-largest player behind AIG and Chubb Corp., has cut back its U.S. D&O operations since early 2001, competitors claim. A Lloyd's spokeswoman would only say: ``We have become extremely selective [about whom to insure].'' 
Premiums were slated to increase by 25% to 400% because of the jump in shareholder litigation after the Nasdaq crash, says Willis Group Holdings, a London insurance broker. And insurers were increasing deductibles. Now they're drastically scaling back the scope of policies. 
Typically, companies take out D&O insurance for high-profile execs and board members. Costs vary by business size and industry. Premiums averaged $242,000 a year for utilities in 2000, reports Tillinghast-Towers Perrin, an insurance-industry consultancy, but were just $67,000 for health-services companies. 
Now, just getting coverage will be hard. Companies that a few years ago could buy all the D&O insurance they needed from one insurer may have to visit 8 or 10 to get covered, says Mark Larsen, a consultant with Tillinghast-Towers Perrin. Insurers are ``being very stingy with their coverage. They're only giving a handful of policies out to their best clients.'' 
Enron is a worst-case scenario for D&O insurers. The pension holders and investors who have filed suits against the company, its officials, and directors know they'll get little from Enron, which is bankrupt. Instead, plaintiffs' lawyers say, their clients hope to recoup some of their losses on the approximately $350 million in coverage that Enron had purchased for its directors and execs--which the company had increased substantially after 1999. The insurers will surely fight any claims in court, and it's far from certain that they'll lose. As a rule, D&O insurance doesn't cover instances of fraud or criminal wrongdoing. 
Insurers deserve some of the blame for their rising D&O risk. After Congress passed the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995--which, among other things, gave executives a legal safe harbor when good-faith projections didn't pan out--insurers thought securities litigation would all but evaporate. They rushed headlong into the D&O market, cutting premiums and offering bonuses such as longer contracts and extra coverage to companies that upgraded their policies. Total available D&O coverage sold annually to U.S. businesses rose 70% between 1995 and 2000, to $1.5 billion. 
Instead, after the Nasdaq crash in spring, 2000, shareholders went on a litigation rampage against tech companies and their investment banks. Securities class-action settlements more than doubled between 1995 and 2000, to $4.4 billion. Average damage awards jumped from $25 million per case to $200 million in that period. Much of that money ultimately came from D&O coverage. 
Now that Enron makes the market look even riskier, some companies may find that they can't afford D&O insurance at all, says Fred Podolsky, CEO of executive risk practices at London's Willis Group. If that happens, top brass will have more reason than ever to make sure that their company is run well. After all, their wallets will be on the line.

Insuring the Boss after Enron
Why Directors & Officers insurance is harder to get and more expensive:
-- Shareholder class actions have more than doubled in 2001 because of the
bear market of 2000, and settlements are getting bigger
-- Lloyd's of London has restricted underwriting in the U.S., Reliance
Insurance filed for bankruptcy, and other major players are tightening
standards
-- The spread of aggressive accounting is making insurers much pickier about
which companies they will underwrite

BusinessWeek Investor: The Fine Print
The Fine Print: How to Read Those Key Footnotes A new periodic series will guide you through accounting issues
By Anne Tergesen

02/04/2002
BusinessWeek

(Copyright 2002 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)

The sudden collapse of Enron, until recently the nation's seventh-largest corporation, took investors by surprise. But had the Wall Street analysts, mutual fund managers, journalists, and individual investors who followed the company dug a little deeper, they could have had a heads-up that all was not quite right at the Houston energy giant long before the bad news broke in October. The source of this information? The footnotes companies are required to publish with their financial statements. 
Buried in Enron's annual report for 2000, for example, are hints of the hidden debt that pushed the company into bankruptcy in December. A footnote on ``preferred stock'' indicates that if Enron's share price were to fall below $48.55--which first occurred on June 14--the company would be obliged to issue stock to a partnership called Whitewing Associates. Other footnotes reveal similar arrangements. True, Enron never put a dollar value on its potential obligations, and the footnotes did not divulge the extent of the partnerships. But enough was revealed to suggest that investors were not getting a full view of the company's finances.
As Enron's collapse illustrates, it is vital to look behind the numbers companies release in quarterly and annual financial statements. That's why BusinessWeek Investor is launching The Fine Print, a series in which we will periodically examine various sorts of footnotes you'll find in company reports. 
Footnotes often list items that can greatly affect the bottom line yet are invisible on the balance sheet, the income statement, and the cash-flow statement. That's because accountants often combine several items into catch-all categories, such as ``other income'' or ``other assets.'' 
Take IBM. Nowhere does Big Blue's 2000 income statement credit its pension fund for boosting earnings by $824 million, or 7% of pretax income. Yet the pension fund's contribution is spelled out in a footnote. Combined with a section of the annual report called ``Management's discussion and analysis,'' the footnotes ``give you some powerful information about the story behind the numbers,'' says Lynn Turner, director of the Center for Quality Financial Reporting at Colorado State University. ``If done right, footnotes will also give you some good predictive information with respect to where the company is headed,'' he adds. 
Footnotes do not make for easy reading, however, and the numbers are often difficult to decipher. In addition, there can be a long lag between the publication of earnings and the clarifying footnotes. Why? While companies generally disclose earnings in a press release shortly after the end of each quarter, they have up to 45 days to file quarterly 10-Qs and up to 90 days to release the annual 10-Ks that contain footnotes. 
There's no cookie-cutter method to extract what's important from the fine print. The footnote devoted to transactions with related parties was important at Enron, for example, but it's not relevant to every company. And you can't assume that one footnote contains all a company has to say about a topic. To investigate off-balance-sheet financing, for example, you must often read several footnotes, including those that detail topics such as related party transactions, minority interests, and unconsolidated affiliates. ``You have to interrelate things,'' says Bob Olstein, portfolio manager of the Olstein Financial Alert Fund. 
Finally, if after reading a set of footnotes you feel more confused than enlightened, steer clear of the stock. As Enron's fall illustrates, companies that aren't straightforward risk seeing investor confidence evaporate at the first sign of trouble. 
We are inaugurating The Fine Print series by examining the footnote for pension accounting. This footnote is key because, during the bull market, income from defined-benefit pension plans became a significant source of profits for many companies. Indeed, pretax earnings were lifted by an average of 12% at the nearly one-third of the companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index that reported pension income in fiscal 2000, says Jane Adams, a pension analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston. Of course, if stock market losses persist, this trend will reverse--with falling pension assets eroding many corporate bottom lines. 
When a company promises to pay pension benefits to retirees, it takes on an obligation, or liability. Attaching a figure to that obligation is an inexact science that involves estimating employees' longevity and future salary levels, among other things. To convert the pension obligation from future dollars to a current value, accountants ``discount'' it at an interest rate that assumes the company will settle its obligation by investing in high-quality bonds. 
This number isn't on the balance sheet. Instead, it is offset by the value of the pension plan's investments, adjusted to smooth out some stock market volatility. Depending on whether the plan's obligation or adjusted value is greater, the company records a net pension asset or liability. 
To find the pension plan's impact on net income, check the pension footnote in the annual report. For Denver-based Qwest Communications International, the note shows that the plan produced a ``net credit''--or addition--to income of $319 million in 2000 (Table 1). Despite this, Qwest lost $81 million that year. 
The same table reveals that the biggest contributor to Qwest's pension windfall was $1.068 billion generated by its ``expected return on plan assets.'' Accounting rules permit the use of an expected return because relying on a day-to-day return would cause net income to jump around with the stock market. The bottom half of this table shows that Qwest expects its plan assets to gain 9.4% a year, on average. It increased that rate from an 8.8% projection in 1999. Given the stock market's doldrums, it's a good bet Qwest didn't meet that goal in 2001. 
In contrast to Qwest's $1.068 billion expected return, its actual return was a $78 million loss in 2000, following a $2.5 billion gain in 1999 (Table 2). If real returns continue to trail expected returns, Qwest may build up deferred losses to the point where accounting rules require the company to put some red ink on the income statement. 
Partially offsetting the $1.068 billion gain generated by ``expected returns on plan assets'' are two expenses itemized in Table 1, service cost and interest cost. Service cost represents the pension benefits employees earned during 2000. Interest cost is the annual interest cost on the pension obligation--a figure analogous to interest payments on debt. 
Check the lower half of Table 1. There you'll find the ``weighted average discount rate'' used to figure the current value of these expenses, as well as the overall pension liability. When this rate--pegged to interest rates--falls, the pension obligation rises, says Janet Pegg, a Bear Stearns accounting analyst. 
The footnote also indicates if a pension fund is over- or underfunded and thus potentially in need of cash infusions. In Qwest's case, the news is good. At the end of 2000, its pension plan was worth $13.6 billion (Table 2). That exceeded the $9.5 billion (Table 3) it promised to deliver in pension benefits by $4.1 billion. (This number appears under ``funded status'' in Table 4.) Because Qwest's pension fund is amply overfunded, the footnote shows no company contribution to the plan in 2000. 
The days of fat pension gains may be over for Qwest. In part because the plan's actual return for 2000 was negative, the deferred gains--technically called ``unrecognized net actuarial gains''--stockpiled during the bull market fell from $4.6 billion to $2.9 billion (Table 4). 
Deferred gains can arise when actual returns exceed expected returns. Such gains are put into a pot, along with gains and losses from other pension items, such as changes in assumptions about future salaries. If the pot becomes big enough, some of it is required to spill over into net income. In 2000, Qwest recognized $58 million (Table 1) of its deferred gains--technically called ``net actuarial gains.'' But with deferred gains dwindling, less will be available to boost the bottom line in the future, says Pegg. More troublesome, if the plan's assets continue to shrink, so will the expected returns that nearly erased Qwest's red ink in 2000. 
It's a good bet that Qwest is not alone. So check the footnotes in those financial statements to find out whether an ugly surprise may be lurking in the form of fading pension income.

Illustration: Chart: Pension Footnotes: What to Look for: TABLE 1: Qwest's pension plan contributed $319 million to its bottom line in 2000. The company also increased the projected return on its pension plan to 9.4%, from 8.8% in 1999. 
Illustration: Chart: TABLE 2: Even though Qwest booked income from its pension plan, the plan actually lost $78 million in 2000. That helped to reduce the plan's value to $13.6 billion. 
Illustration: Chart: TABLE 3: Qwest owed its employees and retirees $9.5 billion at the end of 2000, up from $8.9 billion in 1999. Still the plan was overfunded, because it had $13.5 billion in assets. 
Illustration: Chart: TABLE 4: Qwest records a net pension asset of $894 million on its balance sheet. The table also shows unrecognized gains, a source of corporate profits in the past. This declined from $4.6 billion in 1999 to $2.9 billion in 2000.

Economic Viewpoint
ENRON: A POWERFUL BLOW TO MARKET FUNDAMENTALISTS
By Robert Kuttner

BusinessWeek

(Copyright 2002 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)

The deepening Enron Corp. scandal should hose away an entire world view about how capitalism is supposed to work. But will the right lessons be drawn? As a political scandal, Enron threatens the Bush Administration. No corporation was closer to the Bush family and its Republican allies. No corporation was more political in gaming the system to get the rules written in its favor. The White House damage-control machinery contends that if the President did not try to rescue Enron on the way down, his hands are clean. The real scandal, of course, is how the GOP and its broader world view helped Enron rig the rules on the way up. 
The deeper scandal here is ideological. Enron epitomized an entire philosophy about the supposed self-cleansing nature of markets. Republicans are the more devout practitioners of this ideology, but both parties are implicated.
Enron, as a trading enterprise, claimed to be the quintessence of a pure free market. In practice, it was up to its ears in cronyism, influence-peddling, rigging the rules to favor insiders, and undermining the transparency on which efficient markets depend. Transparency, in turn, demands regulation in the public interest. 
There is no getting around the need for regulation, since capitalism itself requires rules that govern everything from rights to financial and intellectual property to constraints on opportunistic practices that undermine the efficiency of a market system. If you think capitalism can operate in the absence of vigorous, competent, and public-minded government, look at Moscow or Buenos Aires. And government requires politics not corrupted by bribery. For it is democratic politics that elects the officials who make and enforce efficient rules--or don't. 
But for three decades now, the dominant strain of economics from the University of Chicago has been teaching gullible undergraduates and journalists that there is no such thing as the public interest. Efficient outcomes are just the aggregation of selfish private interests, and government's main job is to get out of the way. Well, after Enron, these theorists should learn some other useful trade. 
Even conservatives who reject other forms of government intervention grudgingly concede the need for a Securities & Exchange Commission. Entrepreneurs and traders are not saints. Deregulation is no cure-all, because decisions about which rules to waive are every bit as politicized as the decisions to regulate. We've seen the corruption of deregulation in every imperfect-market realm from electricity to banking to copyright law to airlines, hospitals, and telecom. None of these is an absolutely efficient free market; each one requires rules. And in all of these realms, whether they are regulated or deregulated, corporations seek to game the system and rig the rules. 
But Enron took the prize. It not only cooked its books. It used its extensive political influence to cook the regulatory system itself. When a public-minded chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission stood in Enron's way, Chairman Kenneth L. Lay paid a call and the offender disappeared. Wendy Gramm went from being head of the Commodity Futures Trading Corp. under Bush I to the Enron board. Her husband, Senator Phil Gramm (R-Tex.), helpfully ensured legislation allowing Enron to evade policing either from the CFTC or the SEC. 
At the SEC, Arthur Levitt spent eight years trying to toughen regulation so that corporations would keep honest books and auditors would not also be retained as business strategists and spin-doctors. For this public service to capitalism, Levitt was widely vilified. His successor, Harvey Pitt, came directly from lobbying for the accounting firms who were against Levitt's proposed rules. 
The difference between the Enron scandal and the superficially similar Long-Term Capital Management affair is that LTCM essentially operated beneath everyone's radar. Enron, by contrast, worked to take out the radar stations. The Houston company systematically used its ample political connections to rig the rules--on trading, audits, disclosure, and the mechanics of energy markets. The other difference is that LTCM's dupes were ostensibly sophisticated consenting adults. In the Enron case, a lot of innocent people got badly hurt. 
None of this is new--only the particulars are different. The last time we learned the broad lesson that capitalism is not self-regulating, it took a Great Depression that was followed by a reformist Democratic Administration. This time, there are no catastrophic wider effects (yet), and the incumbent Republican Administration still champions the ideology of laissez-faire and the politics of cronyism. But Enron is to the menace of market fundamentalism what September 11 was to the peril of global terror--a very costly wake-up call. Our political leaders should pay as much attention to this assault on the very heart of capitalism as they paid to the other one.

Special Report: The Enron Scandal: COMMENTARY
A Regulator with His Own Conflicts of Interest
By Gary Weiss

In his two decades of dedicated service to an array of corporations, Securities & Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey L. Pitt won renown as a legal scholar. But that expertise came at a price--a close identification with the interests of his clients. Controversy rages over Pitt's history of legal work for Big Five accounting firms, including Enron auditor Arthur Andersen, which threatens to undermine his leadership in formulating accounting reforms. And Pitt's conflict-of-interest nightmare may only be just beginning. 
As a partner in the Washington law firm of Fried Frank Harris Shriver & Jacobson, he represented firms and individuals throughout the financial-services industry. Although most previous SEC chairmen had worked on Wall Street or were securities lawyers, Pitt's practice was unique in its sheer size and scope. Securities lawyers say that Pitt thus faces actual or apparent conflicts of interest--either can be just as troubling--on a host of issues. Another constraint is equally daunting: Legal ethics forbid him from acting on information he obtained from ex-clients. ``It's impossible to see Harvey Pitt as anything but Prometheus bound. Pitt is shackled to a rock, and the harpies are going to come and pick his guts out,'' says Bill Singer, a New York securities lawyer.
The heart of his future difficulties can be found in a single-spaced, six-page document that Pitt filed with the U.S. Office of Government Ethics on May 24, 2001, after he was nominated to the SEC. It lists Pitt's 112 clients during the preceding two years. Apart from the Big Five accounting firms, the list includes major banks, the mutual-fund and securities industry trade groups, brokerages such as Bear Stearns and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, the New York Stock Exchange, hedge fund titan Dawson Samberg, and corporations such as media giant America Online and its Chairman Stephen M. Case. 
Virtually all could be affected by SEC work in the coming years. The NYSE is vitally interested in issues affecting its heated competition with Nasdaq and electronic trading networks. Charles Schwab and Datek Online closely follow issues affecting online trading, and Nasdaq market making giant Knight/Trimark Group has pressed the SEC not to curtail payments for order-routing, and weighed in on other trading issues. 
Pitt has dealt with potential conflicts by hewing strictly to the law. His spokesperson, Christi Harlan, notes that ``people can always believe that there is the appearance of a conflict of interest, but in [Pitt's] agreement with the Office of Government Ethics he has agreed not to be involved in any matter involving former clients for a year [ending in August], which is what the law requires.'' 
But potential conflicts won't go away just because Pitt is following the rules. If he takes action concerning former clients--even clients from years ago, not on the list--after August, lawyers say he may be seen as either favoring them or bending over backwards to do otherwise. 
Either way, you ``lose the moral high ground,'' says one securities lawyer. ``You want to avoid the appearance of a conflict as well as a real conflict,'' says Ira L. Sorkin, a former SEC regional administrator and now a New York securities lawyer. Sorkin notes that while he has confidence in Pitt's fairness, ``you don't want to create any issues that will call into question a particular decision. It's something that judges and senior people in government avoid.'' 
Pitt has already lost the moral high ground in the No.1 issue on the SEC's agenda. His credibility is open to serious question on many other subjects vital to the markets. And if Pitt's baggage reduces public confidence in the SEC, it may be time to consider if the price of his expertise is too high.

Finance: INVESTING
SHOULD YOU FOLLOW THE INSIDERS? Mimicking their trades in company stock is no sure road to riches
By David Henry and Timothy J. Mullaney in New York

BusinessWeek

Most surefire tips for beating the stock market have short lives. They fizzle out as soon as people figure out that there is no magic formula for making money from stocks. But one concept has had a remarkable run: shadowing the trades of those who have the inside scoop on a company--its executives and directors. A small industry of publications and Web services has sprung up to track their required disclosures to the Securities & Exchange Commission since the late-1990s tech boom, when stock became a key part of executives' compensation. It was not lost on the market at large that many people got rich by investing in their own companies. And all the publicity about prescient selling by Enron Corp. brass before the energy company's demise has given the idea a new push. 
The idea has broad currency. Many mainstream publications cover the topic, including BusinessWeek, which prints data from Vickers Weekly Insider Reports. Numerous academic studies support the view that an increase in insider buying or selling across a sector tends to point to a switch in the market's direction. Insiders at tech and scientific companies in particular seem to have a much better knack for timing the market than ordinary investors. In the months before the Nasdaq hit its March, 2000, peak, techies were selling actively. Since then, they've sold into shallow, short-lived rallies. A study by researchers from the University of California at Los Angeles and New York University shows that a group of insider buyers, most from tech and pharmaceutical companies, beat broad market indexes by an average of 9.6% in the six months following their purchases.
But for individual companies--which is what the bird-doggers really care most about--there's little solid evidence that insider transactions convey much useful information about the near term prospects for a company's stock. A close analysis by BusinessWeek of a series of trades shows why: Many factors, from regulatory restrictions to the ebb and flow of executives' personal finances, control the timing of an insider's transactions and mask the motivations. Arguably, an executive who is buying is probably enthusiastic about his company's prospects, but a big repeat seller could be raising cash for a tuition bill at Harvard University or the downpayment on a ski lodge in Aspen, Colo. And with companies paying an ever-larger part of compensation in stock options, insiders have more incentive to sell shares to cover expenses. 
Besides, SEC filings on insider traders aren't disclosed to the public until several weeks after deals occur--when the optimum time to buy or sell may be past. In addition, brokers are increasingly helping insiders camouflage their transactions by offering them private contracts to stop losses or secretly capture gains. Or they may help them schedule trades months in advance, a tactic permitted by a recent SEC ruling. Moreover, many companies, concerned about impressions of impropriety, limit when their execs can trade so they can't time the market. 
Studies, such as the one from UCLA and NYU, that appear to support investment strategies based on insider tracking turn out on closer analysis to be less-than-rousing endorsements. For instance, the reported 9.6% six-monthly lift was skewed by outsize gains at a few companies. When researchers looked at all companies reporting insider trades, buyers only beat the market by 3.6% on average. And that average was also unrepresentative. In each case, only half of all insider buyers outperformed the market by more than a tiny margin. The study shows that investors would need to mimic hundreds of insiders' trades to lock in above-market returns, according to one of its authors, UCLA Assistant Finance Professor David Aboody. ``You would need an insider fund. An individual investor would lose his pants,'' says Aboody. 
Even those in the insider-tracking business are willing to acknowledge that their data are ambiguous at best. ``You see investor services promoting that Bill Gates sold a large amount'' of Microsoft stock, says Lon Gerber, research director at Thomson Financial/Lancer Analytics. ``And it generally means nothing.'' 
Indeed, even when executives call their company's stock just right, it's often as much dumb luck as anything else. That became clear in interviews with a number of insiders identified by Lancer Analytics as having had astonishingly prescient trading patterns over the past 15 years, measured by returns over the six months following their trades (table). 
Consider the case of David M. Kies, a director of ImClone Systems Inc., a company whose shares plunged after a much-ballyhooed cancer drug failed to pass muster with the U.S. Food & Drug Administration. Kies bought ImClone shares 19 times after joining the board in 1996, and all but once, the stock climbed in the next six months. Last October, Kies made his first sale, at $70, near the stock's high. Nearly three months later, ImClone shares fell below $20. A scared insider bailing? Hardly. Kies sold only 8% of his holdings into a $1 billion tender offer by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. to raise tax money. ``If I didn't have the tax liability, I just would have held on,'' says Kies, adding that he's still a believer in the drug, even though ``I can't say I fully understand the science.'' 
The examples also show that many smart-looking buyers never sell--with unfortunate results. William A. Friedlander, a money manager who sits on the board of telecom carrier Broadwing Inc., made out fabulously for a while. After each of his 10 purchases, Broadwing shares rose an average of 23% in the following six months. The 24,000 shares he bought in July, 1999, at $21 rose 80%. Friedlander still owned those shares at $10. Why didn't he sell? He says he was mistakenly convinced that demand for broadband services would outstrip supply. 
Others, like Paul A. Frame, simply got lucky. The CEO of oil services company Seitel Inc. sold shares that he had acquired earlier, mostly through options, over a decade on 16 different occasions--and in 13 cases the shares were down six months later. But, he says, he sold on a schedule determined by the company's restrictions on when he could trade, according to company spokesman Russell J. Hoffman. 
Even many tech insiders get it wrong. Far from being the first to jump ship, Nortel Networks Corp.'s execs and directors bought 34 times in the months since October, 2000--a period when the stock plunged by 90%. At Gateway Computer Inc., insiders have bought a half-dozen times since mid-2001, but most did so long before Gateway released a weak sales forecast on Jan. 8, which pushed the stock down nearly 30% in one day. It has continued to fall. And Yahoo! Inc.'s ex-CEO Timothy A. Koogle sold $25 million of Yahoo stock last year, much of it before the shares took off on a 65% rally. 
The bottom line: Insider tracking is a lot of work, and it's hardly a sure-fire technique for making money. A pattern of buying or selling might give investors a hint that something's up at a company. But it's still no substitute for dogged research.

THE POST-ENRON WORLD

02/04/2002
BusinessWeek
108
(Copyright 2002 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)

A post-Enron era is beginning to take shape, and those chief executive officers and politicians who miss this change in the culture may find themselves suffering deeply. Enron Corp. clearly crossed the line--but it was a line that much of the country has been walking for a decade. The hyperbolic forecasts that various chief executives fed investors about their companies' prospects became sweeping deceptions by Enron officials. The accounting tricks that companies employed to boost earnings and stock prices became outright duplicity in Enron hands. And the campaign contributions spent by many companies to ensure favorable government treatment worked only too well in Enron's case. 
The Enron scandal appears to be a watershed event. Polls show a deep undercurrent of public distrust in Big Business and its influence in Washington (page 34). Investors are already demanding a new veracity and integrity from chief executives and the balance sheets they present. The next impact, however, may be on the political world as voters question the money connection between Big Business and policymaking. President George W. Bush would do well to understand the change in the nation and follow his champion Theodore Roosevelt in cleaning up the mess in political finances. As he prepares his State of the Union message, the President should seize the moment to back campaign finance reform and reassure Americans that they can trust their elected leaders.
Americans want no less from their corporate leaders. The perfidy of Enron executives contrasts sharply with the post-September 11 honesty of former New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, who became instant public heroes for their simple and truthful appraisals of terrible crises. Compare that to what Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay told BusinessWeek on Aug. 20: ``There are no accounting issues, no trading issues, no reserve issues, no previously unknown problem issues. The company is probably in the strongest and best shape that it has ever been.'' Or compare that to what former Enron Chief Executive Jeffrey K. Skilling said to BusinessWeek on Aug. 23: ``People are afraid there's another shoe to drop, but it's just not the case.'' Skilling resigned on Aug. 14, the day before an Enron vice-president, Sherron S. Watkins, wrote her now-famous memo warning of an enormous ``accounting hoax.'' Enron filed for bankruptcy on Dec. 2, destroying the jobs and the retirement savings of thousands of people. Throughout this time, Lay and Skilling were selling their company's stock while advising investors and their own employees to buy it. 
INVESTORS WANT HONESTY 
In the immediate aftermath of the Enron fiasco, investors already have started demanding much greater clarity and honesty. Look at Tyco International Ltd., which was pressured to split itself into four companies and sell off assets because investors were uneasy about the reliability of the company's accounting methods. Even a passing grade by the Securities & Exchange Commission was not good enough to satisfy these skeptical investors. Meanwhile, the credit-rating agencies are demanding more off-balance-sheet information from companies. And stocks may well shift to a two-tier market in which investors reward companies that choose to return to conservative accounting practices and punish those that don't. The days of slippery pro forma accounting are numbered. 
Washington should get behind the move toward more transparency and honesty in the country's corporate books. The ability of companies to game the entire regulatory process, as Enron did, must be prevented in the future as well. The Securities & Exchange Commission should be leading the reform effort, but it isn't. The attempt of the SEC's chairman, Harvey L. Pitt, to constrain rogue accounting firms that enable companies to distort their earnings is pitifully weak. He suggests yet another oversight committee to check procedures in a profession that already has a half-dozen such groups, none of which has stopped the many accounting scandals of recent years. Pitt's background in representing dozens of major companies, including ones in the accounting industry, in battling SEC regulation make his job all the more difficult (page 39). 
THE SEC SHOULD ACT 
Pitt is unquestionably a man of personal integrity, but he needs to come forth with a far bolder reform plan. The integrity of our financial markets is at stake. 
Beyond that, there is no way to ensure honesty in Washington under the current system of campaign finance. It is impossible to establish arm's-length decisions in the public interest when raising campaign money is constantly on the agenda. The Clinton Administration encouraged chief executives to fly abroad with Commerce Dept. officials to pull in overseas contracts. Their goal was laudable: to compete with Japanese and European government efforts to help their corporate ``national champions.'' At the same time, though, Clintonites were asking those same honchos flying overseas for campaign contributions. Enron's Lay flew to India with members of the Clinton Administration who helped him snag a $3 billion energy contract. He gave generously to Democrats and Republicans alike. Did he get what he paid for? We can't know for sure. Which is precisely the point. 
In the post-Enron environment, Americans are revaluing their financial and political assets--and finding both severely depreciated. Investors are already betting their dollars on more trustworthy companies and CEOs. Voters may soon do the same with their political parties and elected officials. TR said in 1910 that ``our government, national and state, must be freed from the sinister influence or control of special interests.'' After Enron, President Bush should take Teddy's words to heart.

The [Enron] Spillover/The Suicide
Enron Takes A Life

Cliff Baxter had worked hard for all the trappings of a Texas millionaire's life, but the cowboys at Enron had hog-tied his career. Sure, he had the $700,000 house in an exclusive suburb of Houston, a new 2002 Mercedes-Benz S500 sedan in the driveway and a 72-ft. yacht named Tranquility. With millions of dollars in the bank, he and his wife had established a charity to help kids with diabetes and cancer, and Baxter was even considering a new career in teaching. A smart, funny Long Islander who served five years in the Air Force and graduated first in his M.B.A. class at Columbia University in 1987, Baxter, 43, found his place with a bunch of brash Texans building the energy company of the future and rose to become vice chairman. But long before Enron went bankrupt, Baxter realized it was shady. Last week that knowledge helped drive him to suicide. 
Known as a straight shooter who helped protect his employees from Enron's cutthroat culture, Baxter tried to do the right thing, at least initially. Last spring he warned then CEO Jeff Skilling about the dubious financial practices that would eventually be Enron's undoing. By speaking out, he forfeited his chance to become company president. But this was Houston, not Hollywood, and Baxter wasn't Russell Crowe in The Insider; instead of going public with his concerns, he took his millions and walked away.
Last month he was dragged into the glare. After being named in the leaked memo written by Enron whistle-blower Sherron Watkins, Baxter was subpoenaed to testify before Congress--which meant he would have to either take the Fifth or betray friends or himself. He was also one of 29 former and current Enron officials accused in a shareholder lawsuit of cashing in options before prices started plummeting last fall; since 1998, he had cashed out $35 million in stock. The pressure was getting to him--people at his yacht club noticed that since December his hair had gone much grayer. 
Late last week Baxter got into his new $80,000 Mercedes, drove to a median strip not far from his home in Sugar Land, Texas, turned the engine off, locked the doors and shot himself in the head with a single bullet from a .38 revolver. A suicide note was found, reportedly pointing to the problems at Enron. 
Few at the company knew as much about those problems as Baxter, who joined Enron in 1991 and rose quickly, under the tutelage of Skilling, in the marketing wing known as Enron Capital & Trade, eventually becoming Enron's chief of strategy. He negotiated dozens of big deals, including the $3 billion purchase of the Oregon utility Portland General Electric in 1997. He was also in charge of getting rid of many of Enron's hard assets, like power plants, around the globe--part of an effort, some insiders think, to raise cash and help shore up the company's ailing balance sheet. Baxter's onetime division, Enron North America, which sold energy on the wholesale market, often did deals off the books with the company's mysterious limited partnerships like JEDI II, or Joint Energy Development Investments, which is now under investigation. By the end of 2000, his criticism of some of those deals left him in the dead-end job of vice chairman. 
After Baxter's death, Skilling was said to be "devastated." Watkins was "stunned." Former Enron lobbyist Joe Allen was "in shock." Baxter's lawyer said his family, including his widow Carol Whalen and two children, 11 and 16, want "to mourn privately, in peace, with dignity." Friends in Amityville, N.Y., where J. Clifford "Cliffie" Baxter grew up as one of six siblings born to a homemaker mom and police sergeant dad, saw how appearances can deceive. Said Jo Kenny, 66, a friend and neighbor in Amityville: "You think a person has achieved so much, but [problems] go much deeper."

The [Enron] Spillover
The Enron Players; A humbling resignation and hearings in Congress for Andersen executives (with an audience cameo by The Sopranos' Lorraine Bracco) fueled last week's intrigue
Eric Roston

KENNETH LAY Former Enron chairman 
Had he resigned only a few months earlier, Lay might have received a "golden parachute" in excess of $25 million. Instead, he departed in shame last week, and must defend himself from lawsuits and hostile questions during televised congressional hearings that start Feb. 4. Still, Lay, who helped found Enron in 1985 and became its CEO, has received about $200 million in salary, stock and other compensation from Enron since 1999. He enjoyed privileges rare even for top CEOs, such as the $7.5 million revolving credit line Enron extended him, which he reportedly used and repaid with Enron stock 15 times between last February and October. Lay will maintain his seat on Enron's Board of Directors, a perch from which, some say, he can keep an eye on the investigators probing the company.
JEFFREY SKILLING Former Enron CEO 
A week after his surprise Aug. 14 resignation, the media and public, however skeptically, had digested Skilling's claim and his colleagues' swift corroboration that the CEO was leaving the company for personal reasons, after just six months on the job. Between January and August 2001, Skilling sold off about $20 million in Enron stock. He has tried to maintain a low profile--but last week's suicide by former Enron vice chairman Cliff Baxter brought reminders that, according to whistle-blower Sherron Watkins, Baxter had complained loudly to Skilling about Enron's shady bookkeeping. 
DAVID DUNCAN Former Andersen partner 
Duncan, who had overseen Andersen's Enron audit since 1997, was fired Jan. 15 for leading the document-shredding brigade--against company policy, according to official statements. His 15 minutes of fame, though, turned out to be less than five--that's the amount of time it took him to invoke the Fifth Amendment before a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee last Thursday. That brief appearance opened the door for the two Andersen executives, C.E. Andrews and Dorsey Baskin Jr., who claimed that they found it "appalling" that he seemed to manage the shredding "in anticipation of a government request for documents." Duncan, a 20-year Andersen veteran, initiated a rapid document-destruction campaign on Oct. 23, they said, the day after the SEC's Enron probe became public, and it lasted until Nov. 9, when Andersen received a subpoena. Duncan told House investigators that he believes officials at Andersen's Chicago headquarters tacitly encouraged shredding as early as September. 
NANCY TEMPLE Andersen lawyer 
After Duncan declined to answer their questions, the members of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce made quick work of Temple. Her now well-known Oct. 12 e-mail, first reported in TIME, routinely laid out the auditor's policy that explains when nonessential documents such as computer files and e-mail should be kept and when they may be destroyed. But Duncan and Andersen partner Michael Odom heard the message as a starter's pistol for what would become a 17- day document-shredding marathon. Some investigators felt they got a glimpse of Temple's state of mind in a document that emerged last week: Temple told Duncan to remove her name from a memo relating to Enron to decrease the chances she could be a witness, "which I prefer to avoid," she wrote on Oct. 16. 
THOMAS WHITE Secretary of the Army 
A former vice chairman of Enron Energy Services, White faced enemy fire last week for his push last year to privatize energy utilities that supply the armed forces. The activist group Public Citizen accused White of making decisions favorable to Enron soon after he officially joined the Bush Administration last June. Previously, White drew attention for his Enron holdings, more than 400,000 shares- -by far the largest among Bush Administration officials--which he sold between June and October for an estimated profit of more than $12 million. In those months, he says he had 30 strictly personal calls or meetings with Enron employees. 
SHERRON WATKINS Enron vice president 
Corporate-development executives make the unlikeliest folk heroes. But Watkins wrote the prescient Aug. 15 memo to Lay that predicted Enron could "implode in a wave of accounting scandals"--a line that is already a well-worn mantra among Enron's victims.

First; Value Driven
You're On Your Own That Enron workers lost life savings is just another sign that the short era of economic security is over.

The miserable fate of Enron's employees will be a landmark in business history, one of those awful events that everyone agrees must never be allowed to happen again. This urge is understandable and noble: Thousands have lost virtually all their retirement savings with the demise of Enron stock. But making sure it never happens again may not be possible, because the sudden impoverishment of those Enron workers represents something even larger than it seems. It's the latest turn in the unwinding of one of the most audacious promises of the 20th century. 
The promise was assured economic security--even comfort--for essentially everyone in the developed world. With the explosion of wealth that began in the 19th century it became possible to think about a possibility no one had dared to dream before. The fear at the center of daily living since caveman days--lack of food, warmth, shelter--would at last lose its power to terrify. That remarkable promise became reality in many ways. Governments created welfare systems for anyone in need and separate programs for the elderly (Social Security in the U.S.). Labor unions promised not only better pay for workers but also pensions for retirees. Giant corporations came into being and offered the possibility--in some cases the promise--of lifetime employment plus guaranteed pensions. The cumulative effect was a fundamental change in how millions of people approached life itself, a reversal of attitude that must rank as one of the largest in human history. For millennia the average person's stance toward providing for himself had been, Ultimately I'm on my own. Now it became, Ultimately I'll be taken care of.
The early hints that this promise might be broken on a large scale came in the '80s. U.S. business had become uncompetitive globally and began restructuring massively, with huge layoffs. The trend accelerated in the '90s as the bastions of corporate welfare faced reality. IBM ended its no-layoff policy. AT&T fired thousands, many of whom found such a thing simply incomprehensible, and a few of whom killed themselves. The other supposed guarantors of our economic security were also in decline. Labor-union membership and power fell to their lowest levels in decades. President Clinton signed a historic bill scaling back welfare. Americans realized that Social Security won't provide social security for any of us. 
A less visible but equally significant trend affected pensions. To make costs easier to control, companies moved away from defined- benefit pension plans, which obligate them to pay out specified amounts years in the future, to defined-contribution plans, which specify only how much goes into the plan today. The most common type of defined-contribution plan is the 401(k). The significance of the 401(k) is that it puts most of the responsibility for a person's economic fate back on the employee. Within limits the employee must decide how much goes into the plan each year and how it gets invested- -the two factors that will determine how much it's worth when the employee retires. 
Which brings us back to Enron. Those billions of dollars in vaporized retirement savings were in employees' 401(k) accounts. That is, the employees chose how much money to put into those accounts and then chose how to invest it. Enron matched a certain proportion of each employee's 401(k) contribution with company stock, so everyone was going to end up with some Enron in his or her portfolio; but that could be regarded as a freebie, since nothing compels a company to match employee contributions at all. 
At least two special features complicate the Enron case. First, some shareholders charge top management with illegally covering up the company's problems, prompting investors to hang on when they should have sold. Second, Enron's 401(k) accounts were locked while the company changed plan administrators in October, when the stock was tanking, so employees could not have bailed out if they wanted to. 
But by far the largest cause of this human tragedy is that thousands of employees were heavily overweighted in Enron stock. Many had placed 100% of their 401(k) assets in the stock rather than in the 18 other investment options they were offered. Of course that wasn't prudent, but it's what some of them did. 
The Enron employees' retirement disaster is part of the larger trend away from guaranteed economic security. That's why preventing such a thing from ever happening again may be impossible. The huge attitudinal shift to I'll-be-taken-care-of took at least a generation. The shift back may take just as long. It won't be complete until a new generation of employees see assured economic comfort as a 20th-century quirk, and understand not just intellectually but in their bones that, like most people in most times and places, they're on their own.

The [Enron] Spillover
Enron Spoils The Party; Bush wants his State of the Union speech to drown out those stories linking the disgraced company and the White House

We're not going to have to tear up the speech, are we?" George W. Bush asked late last week, as his aides labored over the text of Tuesday night's State of the Union address. Bush was gently mocking the endless process--and perhaps acknowledging how many reasons there are for last-minute rewrites: a war and a recession, an anxious public, an aggressive opposition party, and above all the fast- moving story of the largest corporate bankruptcy in U.S. history--a scandal that has so far defied White House attempts to isolate it or explain it away. In the space of five days last week, the story of Enron's collapse went from the merely unusual to the truly baroque, with plot elements lifted from the pages of Robert Penn Warren and John Grisham. On Tuesday FBI agents moved in when document shredding was discovered inside Enron's Houston headquarters. On Wednesday Enron CEO Kenneth Lay, until recently the national cheerleader for a frictionless new economy and a man the President nicknamed "Kenny Boy," resigned in disgrace, forced out by a board of directors who had apparently been napping for months. One of 11 congressional investigations opened its hearings on Thursday with a tableau we might as well get used to: Enron's former outside auditor taking the Fifth Amendment. On Friday J. Clifford Baxter, 43, an executive who left Enron last May, was found dead in his Mercedes-Benz in the median of a divided highway in the fancy Houston suburb of Sugar Land- -an apparent suicide. That same day, as if on cue, the White House acknowledged that Bush's top political strategist, Karl Rove, had recommended that Enron hire a key G.O.P. consultant during the early days of Bush's presidential campaign five years ago. 
It was one more intimate link between Enron and the Bush team, one more unwelcome story at a time when the President is hoping that his big speech will change the subject back to heroism and unity and patriotism, the themes that have helped make him so popular of late. But even Bush's poll numbers--playing a game that Enron accountants know so well--are beginning to tell two different stories at the same time. For a President with two wars to fight and a 77% approval rating in the new TIME/CNN poll, the Enron story has been up to now little more than a bother. The poll shows that most Americans give Bush high marks indeed for his handling of the war and the terror threat. But when it comes to domestic issues--the economy, health care, the budget deficit--his grades are middling, and Enron is reviving some of Bush's least favorite issues, such as campaign- finance reform, while stoking old questions about whose side he is on. With 45% of those surveyed predicting the recession is going to get worse, 51% said that Bush cares more about Big Business than he does about regular people--an ominous combination for the White House. And so last week Bush told about how his mother-in-law got socked by Enron's collapse. As Bush and his team know, the growing links between the Administration and the company that cooked its books and wiped out the retirement savings of thousands provide the best ground Democrats have had in months for staging fights over issues like tax cuts, the budget and pension reform--the subjects that are increasingly important to people and where Bush gets his lowest marks. No wonder nervous Bush aides reached out last week to at least one prominent Republican who had been critical of the Administration and asked him to tone it down. They called allies in the House and told them to keep it to a dull roar.
One night two weeks ago, White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer pushed back from his desk and smiled. The evening news had just ended and, once more, all the TV stories about Enron dealt with it as an accounting debacle, not a political one. Fleischer looked over at Tom Brokaw of NBC, whose cameras had been shadowing Bush all day, and said, "All right. Did you notice all the Enron stuff that everybody was asking about? Look what made it on the air--the business-scandal side of it." 
By mid-January, Fleischer and other senior officials assumed they had put the Enron problem behind them. They were mistaken. Over the last year, the Bush team had quietly performed a host of political sacraments for the Texas company before it began to go bust, and vice versa: there was the $1.76 million in contributions that Enron executives sent to the G.O.P. during the 2000 campaign; there was the energy policy Vice President Dick Cheney drafted in 2001 after meetings with Enron officials, portions of which seem to have sprung directly from Enron's wish list; there were ex-Enron chiefs and consultants salted around the Bush Administration, from the Army Secretary Thomas White to the U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick. And last summer Bush chose Pat Wood--a man strongly backed by Lay--to be his top energy-price regulator. 
But when top Enron officers bombarded Washington with dire pleas for help last fall, something almost unprecedented happened: nothing. Though both sides had been in contact for months on a variety of issues, at the moment the company threw itself down at the mercy of the feds, top officials at Treasury and Commerce said, in effect, "See ya." Even Robert Rubin, the Clinton Treasury Secretary who dialed up on behalf of Enron's creditors at Citigroup, was turned away by Bush officials. 
The we-did-nothing defense bought the White House time, but there were enough failures in the government's safety net of market, accounting and energy regulation to open the door to more than half a dozen congressional probes--and to give some cover to the hundreds of lawmakers from both parties (including 212 of the 248 involved in the hearings) who had taken money from Enron or its accounting firm, Arthur Andersen. By then the White House seemed cocky. For reasons no one can explain, it went through with its plan to make one of Enron's former lobbyists, former Montana Governor Marc Racicot, the new Republican National Committee boss. 
Each new development had the Democrats rubbing their hands together in anticipation. For months the opposition party had had almost nothing to say, partly because the nation was at war and partly because it was keen to align itself with a popular President. With nothing much to argue about, the Democrats had nothing with which to distinguish themselves. Worst of all, no one in the country was willing to blame the state of the economy on anyone other than Osama bin Laden. "You can only do what you can do based on the cards you have to play," said Senator John Breaux last week. "We don't have many cards." 
Then Enron dealt them a fresh hand. The implosion of the huge Texas energy firm and the sudden loss of retirement funds for thousands of employees and pensioners opened up all the pathways to Scandalland that had been closed since Sept. 11. Every populist conflict in the Democratic playbook has at least a cameo role in the Enron drama: fat cats versus little guys, energy producers versus energy consumers, corporate secrets versus shareholder democracy, business-friendly Republicans against lunch-pail Democrats. 
Last week, when the Congressional Budget Office found that 70% of the federal budget surpluses for this year and the next had evaporated under the weight of last year's tax cuts, the recession and lower post-Sept. 11 spending, it was only a matter of time before someone made Enron a verb. Bush, said Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle, is "slowly Enronizing the economy. Enronizing the budget. We are taking the same approach Enron used in sapping retirement funds and providing them to those at the very top. That's exactly what Enron did. And I'd sure hate to see the U.S. do that." 
Looking around for other things to Enronize, the Democrats turned next to campaign-finance reform. Last week the long-suffering backers of the Shays-Meehan bill to eliminate unregulated soft money finally attracted the 218th signature they needed to get the stalled measure onto the House floor. That doesn't mean it will pass at all, much less soon. The phrase "discharge petition" sounds encouraging but permits a vote only on certain Mondays. The House rarely, if ever, meets on Mondays. (Got that?) 
Like teenagers trying to see how far they can get on a stolen credit card, Democrats then moved on to energy policy. House minority leader Dick Gephardt, gearing up for a presidential campaign, proposed a new "Apollo project" to make the U.S. energy-self- sufficient by 2010. Last week another White House hopeful, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, gave a similar speech, calling for Americans to produce 20% of electricity from renewable sources by 2020. Both proposals are designed to force the White House to side with energy producers and against average Americans. The White House said it is sticking with its own energy plan. 
And when the first Senate hearing on Enron got under way, it felt less like an inquiry and more like a warm, ritual bath designed to soak away the stain of contributions. Senator Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, who got $2,000 from Enron and $11,500 from Arthur Andersen in the past decade, invited former SEC chairman Arthur Levitt, the nation's leading accounting hawk, to do the scrubbing and apply the rinses. That gave Senator Robert Torricelli of New Jersey, who was until recently the subject of a federal probe into his campaign finances, a chance to apologize to Levitt, who had pushed unsuccessfully for lawmakers to tighten accounting standards. "Congress did not respond," Torricelli intoned. "We were wrong. You were right." 
While Senators were making their acts of contrition, Republicans on the House side--with a nervous eye on the coming midterm elections- -were trying to score points by publicly flaying some scapegoats. Arthur Andersen auditor David Duncan, who the company says ordered the shredding of Enron documents at the giant accounting firm's Houston office, took the Fifth in front of the House Energy and Commerce Committee (but not before briefing the panel's investigators behind closed doors). Then Duncan's superiors appeared before the committee and tried to pin all the blame on Duncan rather than take responsibility for a "document retention policy" that seemed to encourage shredding. Republicans got more than twice as much campaign cash from Enron employees as Democrats did in 2000--$1.7 million compared with $683,000--which may be one reason the House panel plans on more hearings next week. 
None of these plot twists brought the story into the West Wing until the New York Times reported last week that conservative strategist Ralph Reed had received a $10,000-a-month consulting contract from Enron in 1997 with a little push from Rove, who was political adviser to then Governor Bush. Like so much about Enron's business practices, it is unlikely that such an arrangement would have been illegal. But the timing of Reed's Enron work had people who know about the finances of fledgling presidential campaigns clucking. A powerful force among Christian conservatives in the late 1990s, Reed was hired by Enron to bang the drum for energy deregulation in Pennsylvania at a time when the Bush team in Austin would have appreciated a low-cost, low-profile way of keeping Reed on their side, off their payroll and yet far from the crowd gathering around Steve Forbes and other conservative rivals. If Rove gave Enron a nudge about Reed--"Karl Rove gave Ralph Reed a good recommendation," said press secretary Ari Fleischer, and Rove says he doesn't recall-- then the young Bush campaign was at least capable of the same sort of creative accounting that ultimately brought down Enron in December: finding quiet, off-the-books ways to help itself and its friends. 
Democrats termed the disclosure serious and promised to investigate. Reed, a political consultant in Georgia, points out that Enron tried to hire a Democrat, James Carville, for the same work in 1997--something Carville, no friend of Rove's, acknowledges. And Rove told Time that if he spoke to anyone at Enron about Reed, it might have been only after Reed was hired. An Enron official, meanwhile, who says he and two others made the decision themselves, told TIME they had no contact with Rove about the matter. But a veteran G.O.P. organizer who was in contact with Reed in 1997 said Reed told him the Bush campaign had steered business his way--something Rove doesn't deny. 
After a year in office, one thing is clear about Bush's political operatives: when they make a mistake, they fix it fast. When their conservative instincts lead them down a path that much of the country isn't keen on, they are awfully good at changing the subject while holding to their original course. Which is why Bush, early last week, said his mother-in-law was one of the little people who got screwed by the corporate giant. On a trip to a West Virginia machinery shop Tuesday, Bush told workers that Jenna Welch, 82, had lost almost all of her $8,000 investment in Enron last year. And he fired up his own boilers a bit, saying he was "outraged" by what happened at the Texas firm. But the Bush team didn't stop there. By late last week, it got out a few more iron shields to wedge between the White House and the mess in Texas. On Friday the Administration announced that it had ordered a government-wide review of more than $60 million in federal contracts with Enron and Andersen. Mitch Daniels, Bush's budget director, said the move was "purely a management issue." 
Meanwhile, the long-simmering dispute between Dick Cheney and Congress about the Vice President's energy task force started bubbling again. The General Accounting Office, which is as close as Congress comes to having an independent auditor, announced that it would file a lawsuit against the White House this week if Cheney did not fork over the details of his energy task force's private meetings with Enron officials. The GAO had postponed the suit after Sept. 11, but when it became clear Cheney had no intention of complying with its request, or even negotiating, the tiny agency decided to fight. 
Congressional interest in those documents increased last week when House Democrats discovered what they think may be a subtle but significant last-minute change in Bush's energy policy, made before it was submitted to Congress. According to Rep. Henry Waxman, a California Democrat, language was added to the final energy plan that was designed to help Enron with a financially troubled power-plant project in India. Waxman obtained a copy of an earlier draft of the plan, dated March 30 and written by an interagency group. That version, sent to Cheney, included no reference to India's energy output, Waxman said. But when Cheney made his final energy plan public in May six weeks later, the proposals included a new section calling for increased energy production in India. The plan directed the secretaries of State and Energy to work with India to help that country maximize its domestic oil and natural-gas output. The provision was significant because Enron has a controversial $2.9 billion natural-gas-fired Dabhol power plant in India, but the plant's only customer, the state of Maharashtra, found Enron's prices too high and began buying power elsewhere. Enron was eager to get out of the Dabhol investment or get the facility back on line and had sought Washington's help. Cheney met with Lay on April 17, exactly one month before the final energy proposals were unveiled. Waxman asked Cheney in a letter late last week to explain how the provision evolved and who recommended it. 
Waxman's line of questioning is exactly the kind of inquiry that White House officials say the public has no patience for. Lengthy probes into the provenance of a few sentences in an already aging federal report, they add, is the sort of duck soup that turned voters off about Washington and politics for much of the Clinton era. Republicans believe this in part because they learned that lesson the hard way. The party's take-no-prisoners wing is still smarting a bit from 1998, when it did not realize until too late that its drive for Bill Clinton's scalp did as much if not more harm to their own party than it did to the President's. 
However much oxygen Enron has pumped into Democrats, it doesn't change the fact that Bush has the highest sustained approval ratings in memory--and a monumental set of tasks ahead of him. That explains why, after delivering his State of the Union speech Tuesday, he planned to hit the road for two days selling his proposals to the public. Many are sure to be popular: more money for defense, intelligence gathering, homeland security and border controls and more tools for police and fire fighters. If Bush has had to shelve his plans to reform Medicare and Social Security--money is tight, and the country is in no mood to experiment with retirement benefits-- that's not an entirely unpleasant outcome. Those waters are treacherous, and many wondered why he ever thought about diving in. 
Bush will try lots of little things to release the pressure building up in the Enron pipeline. He has indicated that he will sign the campaign-finance measure if it ever makes it to his desk. Aides indicated last week that he will also get behind efforts to strengthen the rules that require companies to disclose information about hidden liabilities. He will call on Congress to make sure that employees have ways to diversify their retirement savings so that other Enrons don't happen. And with unemployment rising, the former oilman is capping talk of tax cuts and boosting talk about jobs, jobs, jobs. 
But the main valve Bush will open now is the one labeled "war." In that arena, the public has given him a free hand to spend whatever he wants, finish off al-Qaeda in Afghanistan, hunt down its cells around the world and build up U.S. military muscle. He is already moving into the second phase of the war, tracking terrorists in countries like the Philippines, Somalia and Sudan. Sitting at Camp David two weekends ago, he told his aides he believed that roughly 100,000 al- Qaeda-linked terrorists might still be at large around the world. "We're not going to stop short," he said. 
All is fair in war and politics, but there are some battlefield tactics the combatants would rather not discuss. Democrats want to take away Bush's fatigues and drag him back to last year, to the days when his presidency lacked a clear purpose. The President wants to go in the opposite direction, wrapping the entire country--Democrats included--in a warm, unifying embrace, complete with new proposals to foster volunteerism and charity. Safe inside that hug of unity, he dares the Democrats to break the mood that faced down terrorism. A senior official predicted to TIME that voters who care about Enron and its White House ties will lose interest after the next big bombing raid. If Bush has his way, investigating the Administration's links to Enron or challenging his plans for mending the economy will seem as unpatriotic as questioning the choice of bombing targets in Tora Bora.

The [Enron] Spillover/Karl Rove
Did W.'s Playmaker...

Karl Rove loves a three-cushion shot. As the President's chief political brain, the Texan, 51, delights in crafting a message or staging a presidential visit that doesn't just score a political point but also plays to several constituencies at once. So when it was reported in the New York Times that Rove might have steered an Enron contract to Ralph Reed, a G.O.P. kingmaker whose support Rove needed, the political elite in Washington, which includes some longtime enemies, thought that just might be his kind of pool. 
All the key players involved denied any funny business, but that didn't stop the chatter. It doesn't take much to get people talking about Rove. He is the architect of Bush's two gubernatorial victories in Texas as well as his presidential race. He has also been the President's tutor, feeding him histories and biographies to read. Inside the White House he is at the center of every political and domestic policy decision. He helps determine where the President spends his political capital, and in an election year when both houses of Congress are up for grabs, he is watching over hundreds of races.
Last year Rove was criticized for meeting with officials from several companies in which he owned a substantial amount of stock. Rove dumped the stocks, but there was no way his financial portfolio didn't conflict with his political one, said critics, including at least one Democratic Congressman who has called for an investigation. Those holdings included $100,000 to $250,000 of Enron shares, which already had Democrats contemplating a look into Rove's relationship with the company. Though he has never worked for Enron and the shares he owned were bought out of his own pocket, last week's disclosure that Rove recommended Reed, who was hired by the company, may move congressional Democrats to summon him for testimony. 
That would be a rare spectacle for everyone in Washington who spends time charting and discussing Rove's moves. The top political adviser to every President takes on celebrity status around town, and like those who have come before him, Rove doesn't mind encouraging the perception that he has a hand in just about every political deal that goes down. As a result, people assume that every story they hear about him is true--which is why some insiders don't believe him when he insists he didn't pull strings with Enron to help curry favor with Reed. 
But some of his denials are worth believing. At the end of the 2000 presidential campaign, for example, the owlish Rove was suspected as the mastermind behind a scheme involving a stolen videotape of George W. Bush's debate preparations. Many were convinced that Rove had mailed the tape to the Gore campaign, hoping strategists there would secretly watch it. Then at just the right moment, Rove would leap out and expose them as sneaks willing to do anything to get ahead. Some in the press even published the whole yarn as if it were known to be true. But it was just hooey. A low- level former Democrat in a campaign consultant's office was prosecuted and jailed for sending the tape. Rove wasn't involved at all. It was a bum rap, but Rove probably doesn't mind. Those kinds of suspicions are the price he pays for being the President's playmaker.

The [Enron] Spillover/Ralph Reed
...Do A Favor For A G.O.P. VIP?

If Karl Rove did land an Enron consulting job for Ralph Reed, one thing is certain: Reed didn't really need his help. Reed's choirboy looks notwithstanding, he was no neophyte trying to get into the business. By the time he stepped down as executive director of the Christian Coalition in April 1997, Reed, now 40, was considered such a shrewd political operator and grass-roots organizer that any number of FORTUNE 500 firms were knocking on his door. 
Still, there is no doubt that the Bush campaign had plenty of reasons to make Reed happy. After taking over Pat Robertson's fledgling religious organization in 1989, Reed turned it into a political force, exercising something close to veto power over the Republican presidential nominee. If Reed had signed up with one of Bush's conservative rivals, Bush's White House dreams might have been threatened. But if Reed had too visible a role in the Bush campaign, his right-wing reputation might step on Bush's compassionate- conservative message.
The answer may have been to have Reed play an informal, behind- the-scenes role in the campaign while earning a tidy sum working for one of Bush's most dedicated supporters. Late last week the White House confirmed that Rove did indeed recommend Reed to officials at Enron in 1997. Both Reed and Rove, however, vehemently deny that this was part of any kind of deal to secure Reed's backing. Reed insists he was not even aware that Rove had put in a good word for him and claims that he had pledged his support to Bush as far back as April 1997, five months before he was hired at Enron. "I was always going to be with him," Reed told TIME. "The idea this [Enron job] was an additional inducement is not only untrue, it's insulting." He also dismissed any notion that the Bush campaign had to keep him at a safe distance, citing dozens of campaign and TV appearances as evidence to the contrary. 
Reed definitely paid dividends for Bush on the campaign trail. After the candidate's stunning loss to John McCain in the New Hampshire primary, Reed's firm came to the rescue in South Carolina, bombarding the state's 400,000 religious conservatives with negative phone calls and mailings about the maverick candidate from Arizona. Bush won handily. 
Reed was almost as successful at Enron. He spent most of his time advising the company on how best to drum up support for energy deregulation. He made about $10,000 a month for 12 to 18 months of work, focusing initially in Pennsylvania, and Enron got much of what it wanted from the state, which deregulated its electricity market without making California's costly mistakes. But even Reed couldn't help Enron persuade the state to let it immediately compete for the customers of incumbent utility PECO Energy. 
This isn't the first time Reed has been in hot water. During the 2000 presidential campaign, his firm publicly apologized for lobbying a Republican candidate on behalf of Microsoft, which was hoping to get a better hearing from a new Administration. The candidate, of course, was one of Reed's other clients at the time--Governor George W. Bush.

The [Enron] Spillover
Can Lawmakers Now Afford To Be Obstacles To Reform?

Washington has its own version of the business cycle: when times are good, get rid of pesky regulations that companies complain are holding them back; when things turn sour, start crying for rules. No legislator wants to appear to be blocking reform now, especially in an election year, but previous efforts have faded away when the headlines did. Here are four areas of reform and the hurdles they face. 
--By Mitch Frank. With reporting by Sally B. Donnelly/Washington
AUDITING LAWS 
"We were wrong." When Senator Bob Torricelli of New Jersey said those words in a hearing last Thursday, it marked a dramatic turnaround. For years, Congress has aided the accounting industry's efforts to avoid new auditing rules. Torricelli is one of many lawmakers (including Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman) who have pressured the SEC several times over the past decade to back off on tougher regulations for auditors. Clinton-appointed SEC chairman Arthur Levitt tried to enact rules that would have kept firms from auditing and consulting for the same clients and forced companies to publicly disclose more liabilities, such as executive stock options. Each time Congress quashed Levitt's efforts. But that opposition was gone at last week's hearing. "Perhaps the era of self-regulation is over," said Tennessee Senator Fred Thompson. But President Bush's SEC chairman, Harvey Pitt, doesn't share Levitt's concerns. As a lawyer and lobbyist for the accounting industry for more than 20 years, Pitt led the fight against Levitt's proposals. Now he's pressing for a new industry-funded oversight board. But the current board never flunked an auditor in 25 years of peer reviews. Pitt's proposal "lacks teeth and independence," says Levitt. The Senators may be talking about stricter regulation in televised hearings, but they're not proposing many bills. Will their change of heart last long enough to result in real action? 
401(K) REFORM 
It's impossible to find anyone on Capitol Hill these days opposed to new protections for 401(k)s. No members of Congress want voters to think they don't care about Enron employees who watched their retirement savings disappear into a black hole of creative accounting. Talking of how his mother-in-law lost $8,000 in Enron stock, President Bush put together a Cabinet team to study the issue. Senators Barbara Boxer and Jon Corzine are pushing a bill that would limit the amount of an employer's stock in its 401(k) plan and ease restrictions on how soon employees could sell it. Boxer only had to dust off a similar bill she proposed in 1997, when Texas retailer Color Tile went bankrupt. No one is vocally opposing the Boxer- Corzine bill--yet. "There's a lot of shrapnel up here," says a Senate staff member. "People are keeping their heads down." But businesses and their lobbyists don't like the idea, arguing that the restrictions would push employers to stop offering matching contributions. They fought Boxer's 1997 bill until it quietly died in committee. One person keeping quiet is Phil Gramm, usually a leading opponent of such restrictions. Gramm's wife Wendy served on the audit committee of Enron's board, and the Texas Senator has recused himself from Enron matters. His fellow Republicans are also holding their fire, for now. 
ENERGY DEREGULATION 
Anyone who watched both the struggle to keep the lights on in California and the implosion of Enron might be getting cold feet about deregulation. Not Joe Barton. The Texas Congressman, who chairs the House subcommittee on energy, hopes to get a bill further deregulating public utilities to the floor by the end of next month. Barton and other proponents see Enron as an isolated example. The White House has no plans to hold off on its energy bill and proposals for drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Opponents are adding Enron to their arguments, though no one new is fighting the bill. But the scandal has won converts to government oversight of energy-futures trading. Enron had persuaded Washington not to monitor the trades. 
CAMPAIGN FINANCE 
Enron broke the logjam on the long-stalled campaign-finance bill. House sponsors obtained 218 signatures--including those of 20 Republicans--last Thursday to force the G.O.P. leadership to take it to the floor. Charles Bass of New Hampshire provided a key Republican signature last week after failing to persuade Speaker Denny Hastert to allow debate. The bill still faces a tough vote; House majority whip Tom DeLay plans to fight it. But the 186 Representatives and 71 Senators who took Enron money may find the bill the easiest way to wash their hands. Opponents hope that Bush will veto it.

The [Enron] Spillover
Under The Microscope; After Enron, investors are looking more skeptically at companies whose bookkeeping seems confusing

As questions swirled around its accounting practices, Tyco International, an industrial and services conglomerate with $36 billion in annual revenues--and a beaten-down stock price--said last week it would split into four companies in a bid to "unlock tens of billions of dollars of shareholder value." The company's combative CEO, Dennis Kozlowski, predicted the breakup would add 50% to the stock price. Going him one better, Don MacDougall of J.P. Morgan Chase said the move would make the stock worth $80 to $90 a share-- double the current price. Haven't they heard? Post Enron, any hint of questionable accounting is the functional equivalent of finding asbestos in everything a company makes. So a day that dawned with promise for Kozlowski quickly turned to loss. By week's end Tyco shares were at $45, down 3% from the day before its breakup was announced--and down 24% since fresh accounting worries surfaced at the start of this year. 
Kozlowski insists that "Tyco has better disclosure in its financial statements than anybody out there." Almost two years ago, the company emerged from an informal Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry with no action against it, and in an unusual step, the SEC has put out word that no new inquiry is under way at Tyco. But while there appears to be nothing illegal about Tyco's bookkeeping, jumpy investors are suddenly setting a higher standard. They want to see clearly how a company earns, spends and invests. And Tyco--despite its planned reorganization--remains a complex conglomerate, with headquarters in tax haven Bermuda. Many investors feel it still doesn't reveal enough. Says James Chanos, president of hedge fund Kynikos Associates: "Investors just have to exercise a fair amount of diligence when looking at companies that appear confusing."
In a financial world shaking from the Enron scandal, many investors are viewing with fresh skepticism the bookkeeping methods of a range of companies, including even blue chips that are widely admired and accused of nothing illegal. Some of the companies that investors point to are American Airlines, the insurer American International Group, Coca-Cola, Electronic Data Systems, General Electric, IBM, J.P. Morgan Chase and Xerox. 
These marquee names say it all. Even companies once considered above suspicion are being subjected to increasing scrutiny. Under current accounting rules, management can essentially do whatever it pleases, says David Dreman of Dreman Asset Management, based in Jersey City, N.J. It can scatter explanations in impenetrable footnotes it is confident no one has the time or capacity to decipher. "There are enormous overstatements of earnings and understatements of expenses," he says. 
Enron's unraveling can be traced to investors' first whiff of "off- balance-sheet" partnerships that hid billions of dollars of the company's liabilities. By the time Enron crashed, it was primarily a trading firm. It had relatively few hard assets to cushion its fall when business faltered and hidden debts came due. The risks aren't nearly so great at asset-rich companies like Tyco and GE. But, as with Enron, seasoned analysts have trouble determining whence, exactly, they derive their profits. 
Since the Enron fiasco blew wide open, the influential Moody's Investors Service has requested additional information from some 4,000 companies that use accounting methods that Moody's believes make it harder to judge their creditworthiness. Companies are also deciding on their own that confusing books just aren't worth it. Last Wednesday, Bank of America went to great lengths to explain a $418 million gain in the fourth quarter from a subsidiary set up last year to deal with problem loans. The gain resulted from tax savings after bad loans were shifted to the subsidiary. Not wanting an Enron-like taint, the bank clearly spelled out to analysts the legal maneuver, and investors rewarded the extra disclosure by pushing the stock up 4% in a week. 
K Mart, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last week, announced on Friday that it was looking into internal accounting issues. The company offered no details. But the accounting getting closest scrutiny in the wake of Enron generally falls into three categories: 
REVENUE RECOGNITION The SEC says its No. 1 line of inquiry is into the ways that companies book their sales. The most glaring example of revenue fraud occurred at Sunbeam five years ago. (The company's infamous former CEO, "Chainsaw" Al Dunlap, just last month settled a shareholder suit stemming from his stint at the small-appliance maker.) Sunbeam recorded the sale of gas grills and other goods well before they left the warehouse. Many of the items never did get shipped. By offering retailers deep discounts to place orders months before they normally would and by booking those sales immediately, Dunlap was able to show escalating revenue and earnings. Eventually, though, the scheme collapsed as retailers couldn't sell enough appliances even at discount prices and had to cancel orders. 
The SEC warned Xerox three weeks ago about booking sales of copiers that, technically, are leased, not sold. Revenue from a lease is generally reported over the life of the lease, not up front. Xerox has said it will contest the SEC on this issue. 
Some telecom companies are getting a second look, partly because more than a few use Arthur Andersen, Enron's auditor, but also because many achieved their once spectacular growth partly by immediately recognizing revenue from long-term contracts, analysts say. Qwest has received the most attention because its merger with US West opened the door to other accounting issues. Qwest has denied that it did anything wrong. "Think about a bottle of wine," former SEC chairman Arthur Levitt said in a speech two years ago. "You wouldn't pop the cork on that wine before it was ready. But some companies are doing this with their revenue, recognizing it before a sale is complete, before the product is delivered to a customer or at a time when the customer still has options to terminate, void or delay the sale." 
MANAGED EARNINGS Critics of Tyco, which has bought hundreds of companies over the years, charge that it inflates write-downs for the costs of its acquisitions, in effect creating stored earnings it can summon at will to pump up quarterly results in a way that makes earnings growth appear to be the result of expanding sales or higher margins. These allegations are "totally inaccurate," Kozlowski says. But those denials aren't persuasive to David Tice, who runs the Prudent Bear Fund and practices short selling, a technique that bets on a stock to fall. He has sold Tyco stock short and asserts that Tyco's core growth rate is just 7% or so a year--not the 15% to 20% that the company reports. 
While investors sort that one out, they can also look at GE, famous for its steadily rising earnings and steadily rising stock price. GE is an acquisitive conglomerate known for reporting one- time gains and one-time losses in striking balance, keeping growth on a calm and steady course. The company has also benefited from earnings that flow from its overfunded pension plan. Last year, with the broad stock market down 13%, GE reported a whopping $1.7 billion of income from pension-plan investments. How could that be? Here's one possibility cited by stock analysts: by raising the estimated rate of return on the money set aside to fund employee pensions in the future, a company can immediately cut the amount of money it sets aside and let that flow to the bottom line. But if the higher returns never materialize, there will be an earnings hit later on. GE denies that it manages its earnings. "I don't want to be painted with that brush," CEO Jeffrey Immelt told analysts last week. 
Stock analysts also question the pension accounting of IBM, which two years ago assumed a 9.5% rate of return on pension investments and has upped that expected return to 10%. IBM has said the increase was based on its experience in managing the fund. 
Insurance companies routinely set aside reserves for future claims. Because insurer AIG has posted steadily rising profits for years, some analysts believe the company may over-reserve in good times and use the stored earnings to pump up results in bad times. AIG has said its policy for setting aside reserves is appropriate and fully disclosed in regulatory filings. 
Cisco has come under the lens, as have a slew of other tech companies, for its use of so-called pro forma earnings, which may leave out recurring expenses and are often referred to as "earnings before all the bad stuff." Last year Cisco asked investors to ignore a $2.2 billion charge for inventory loss, which most accountants consider to be a normal business expense rather than something extraordinary. 
HIDING DEBT This is where Enron got into trouble. Yet hundreds of companies shift liabilities off their books without breaking any laws or accounting rules. Many, like Enron, use special-purpose entities (SPE) that, as long as the entities receive at least 3% of capital from outsiders, can be left off the consolidated books of a parent company. 
There are other ways to hide debt. In the 1980s Coke divested most of its bottling operations and saddled them with most of the parent company's long-term debt. Coke kept stakes of just under 50% in the bottlers, giving it the leverage to force price increases for syrup even when the bottlers couldn't pass on those costs. Coke's large ownership interest means that it is on the hook for much of the bottling companies' liabilities, yet the bottlers' debts do not show up on Coke's balance sheet. For that reason, some analysts consolidate the bottlers with Coke in looking at the company's financial picture. 
Liabilities can also be covered over with extensive lease agreements. Both United and American airlines owe billions of dollars on long-term leases for aircraft. Those are real obligations but do not show up as debt. Data processor EDS is potentially liable for $500 million in financing costs for computers that its customers use- -an item that appears only in a footnote to a company report. And J.P. Morgan Chase has a nearly $1 billion liability as a 49% partner in an SPE called Mahonia that traded energy contracts with Enron. In accounting, there's always more than meets the eye. 
--With reporting by Bernard Baumohl and Unmesh Kher/New York 
OTHERS GETTING NEW SCRUTINY Here are some companies whose accounting practices have raised eyebrows among investors, analysts and regulators since Enron's collapse: 
--TYCO Denies that it bolsters earnings growth by taking excessive write-downs for merger costs and using them later 
--GENERAL ELECTRIC Says it doesn't smooth quarterly profits by carefully matching one-time gains and losses and by boosting income from its pension plan 
--AMR The parent of American, like many airlines, owes billions of dollars in long-term lease agreements that do not show up as debt on the balance sheet but for which it is liable 
--J.P. MORGAN CHASE Like other banks, it has "off-balance-sheet" partnerships (some of them traded with Enron) that have lost much of their value 
--K MART Now bankrupt, the discount chain says it is investigating the possibility that improper accounting methods distorted its balance sheet 
--XEROX is contesting a Securities and Exchange Commission warning not to book revenue from leased copiers as if they had been sold 
--QWEST Has drawn attention for the way it accounted for its merger with US West as well as for how it books revenue. The company denies any wrongdoing 
--EDS Finances clients' computers and is liable if a client cancels a contract. But EDS says it need not show this liability on its books 
--IBM Says it is justified in raising estimates of returns to its pension fund--a move that instantly boosts reported revenues 
--COCA-COLA Shifted billions of dollars in debt to Coke bottlers, in which it has large ownership stakes, and says it is in compliance with accounting rules

Nation; Global Agenda
The Incredible Shrinking Businessman Corporate titans are out. Government reforms are in. Is it the dawn of a new era?

When a rock-ribbed conservative columnist at the Wall Street Journal and the man who was Bill Clinton's chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission use the same sweeping adjective to describe a situation, you know they're talking about something serious. Testifying before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee last week, Arthur Levitt, former head of the SEC, identified the Enron affair with "an emerging crisis of systemic confidence in our markets." Three days earlier, Robert L. Bartley had written in the Journal of the "systemic failure" at the root of the matter, one that touched "Directors suspending their ethical guidelines... Accountants and lawyers studiously looking the other way... Wall Street analysts failing in their principal duty." 
It's the sense that Enron represents the failure of a system, not just of a Texas oil-and-gas-and-cybertrading company, that gives the case its weight. In capitalism's 700-year history, financial scandals are two a penny. As detailed in Charles Mackay's Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds, some of them had far more devastating impacts than Enron's collapse ever will. John Law's Mississippi Co., for example, bankrupted 18th century France, until Law was chased out of Paris and songs were sung in the streets advocating "the application of all his notes to the most ignoble use to which paper can be applied." From Credit Mobilier to Cendant, from Jay Gould to Ivan Boesky, under Republican Presidents and Democratic ones, wherever and whenever there is a chance to make a dishonest buck, someone will take it.
Enron stands out from this sorry list not by virtue of the company's size but because the scandal is of such a fundamental nature. At the heart of capitalism is the act of investment, which is nothing more than a decision by one party to lend money to another in the hope of a return. The system can't function without trust--trust that the money so lent will not be stolen or applied to illegal purposes, and trust that an enterprise's accounts will accurately reflect the state of its business. Company directors, lawyers and accountants are said to have "fiduciary" duties--the word derives from Latin for trust--that place upon them obligations to do more than collect fees and salaries. 
Time was when investors were drawn mainly from those rich enough to look after themselves. But those days are long past. From 1989 to 1998, the number of Americans who invested in shares--either directly or through mutual funds, savings accounts and retirement plans--grew from 52 million to 84 million. Enron matters because those charged with the trust of such investors--many of them new to the markets-- let them down. A system that has brought unimagined prosperity cannot survive if such betrayals become commonplace. 
The scandal may prove to be systemic in a broader sense. For reasons that are well understood--the years of turmoil between John Kennedy's assassination and Richard Nixon's resignation, the end of the cold war, the absence of a sustained national emergency that required a strong Federal Government--the authority of the American political process has been in a long decline. At the same time, the reputation of U.S. business leaders has grown extraordinarily. In the 1980s and '90s, Lee Iaccoca, Sam Walton, Bill Gates, Andy Grove, Jack Welch and their ilk became our new heroes. Businessmen seemed to combine a buccaneer's spirit with a slide-rule mind. "Washington" (the word had to be said with a sneer) was, by comparison with the worlds of our titans, disorganized and inefficient, quite hopeless. 
Not long ago, many would have placed Enron's Ken Lay--innovative, daring--in the pantheon of American business. That such a judgment could be made by those not otherwise known for idiocy places our value system into question. The task of companies is to provide returns for investors and so create jobs and spread wealth. But by the '90s, top businessmen had become celebrities, writing books (or having them ghostwritten), gracing covers of magazines and preaching the wonders of American management and transparent accounting practices to companies in other countries. After Enron, the audiences overseas for heroes of glamour capitalism may diminish; meanwhile Americans have become appreciative of safety and security--for themselves and their money. At such a time, it's natural to look to government, not institutions driven by the imperatives of the market. 
The Enron affair matured into a scandal just as it began to seem that the culture of celebrity was defunct; suddenly, we remembered that Barbra Streisand was not a political philosopher. Neither is Jack Welch or Bill Gates or, certainly, Ken Lay. In the '90s, we treated businessmen as if they were film stars (and we treated film stars like gods). But we lend stars our affections only; we lend businessmen our chance of future prosperity. A lesson from Enron: we would be wise to entrust that responsibility to those with their feet on the ground, not on a pedestal. Even if we built it for them.

The [Enron] Spillover/K Mart's Fall
Blame Enron?
Eric Roston

(Copyright 2002)

There are plenty of management shortcomings to blame for K Mart's bankruptcy. But the discount chain got a good shove from the Sept. 11 attacks--and from Enron. Here's how: 
Most states require large companies like K Mart to buy commercial surety bonds, which guarantee, among other things, worker's compensation payments to employees hurt on the job. During the roaring '90s, when risk wasn't a four-letter word, sureties were relatively inexpensive and were used for many purposes. But as the economy slowed, especially after Sept. 11, more and more companies defaulted, leaving insurers the bill.
Enron, which insured future gas deliveries with surety bonds, left J.P. Morgan Chase the task of claiming $2.5 billion from insurers that are fighting the bank in court. 
Many insurers in December decided to reduce their exposure to the surety-bond market. That helped create a supply shortfall, and insurers asked credit-starved companies like K Mart and United Airlines to pony up cash collateral for their sureties--cash that K Mart did not have. 
Wal-Mart and Target have good credit--and no surety problems. While there is no indication that surety will tip another company into bankruptcy--as K Mart claims--their cost is rising and scarcity increasing.

NYSE Moves To Delist Enron Stock
By Gaston F. Ceron

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The New York Stock Exchange said it is suspending trading in Enron Corp. (ENE) and moved to delist the embattled energy company's shares from the Big Board.
The NYSE said in a statement that it "has determined that the company's securities are no longer suitable for trading on the NYSE." The exchange's action affects not only Enron stock, but also other Enron securities, such as preferred convertible stock. 
Enron officials weren't immediately available for comment. 

Enron's collapse last year triggered a huge drop in the company's stock, sending it down to mere pennies a share, as well as layoffs at the Houston company. It also set off the biggest U.S. corporate bankruptcy ever. 
The NYSE moved to delist Enron after the company's stock traded below the critical level of $1 for 30 consecutive days, placing it in violation of the Big Board's listing standards. 
"The exchange notes that today's action is being taken due to the expected protracted nature of the company's bankruptcy process and the uncertainty at this time as to the timing and outcome of this process as well as the ultimate effect on the company's common shareholders," the NYSE said in a written statement. 
The exchange said it will apply to the Securities and Exchange Commission to delist Enron securities "upon the completion of applicable procedures, including any appeal by the company of the NYSE staff's decision." 
The last time Enron shares traded at the NYSE was Thursday. Trading in the shares has been halted since.

Christina Cheddar contributed to this article. 

Reached later, Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said the NYSE's decision wasn't a surprise to the company. 
"This will have no effect on our business," Denne said. "We are still evaluating the NYSE's decision and have not yet made a final determination of any action we may take."

(Updating to add further details) 
NEW YORK (AFX) - The New York Stock Exchange said it is delisting Enron Corp shares with immediate effect after they traded below the exchange's one usd threshold for more than a month.
The shares, which have been suspended from trading for the past several days pending the announcement of details of the company's sale of its wholesale energy trading unit to UBS Warburg, last traded at 67 cents. 
In a statement, the NYSE said Enron has the right to a review of the decision by a committee of the board of directors of the exchange. 
"The Exchange notes that today's action is being taken due to the expected protracted nature of the company's bankruptcy process and the uncertainty at this time as to the timing and outcome of this process as well as the ultimate effect on the company's common shareholders," said the statement.

Writer Of Enron Warning Letter Worked With Ex-CFO Fastow
By Jason Leopold

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The letter to Enron Corp. (ENE) Chairman and Chief Executive Ken Lay last August, warning that irregularities relating to Enron's off-balance sheet partnerships could bring about the company's demise, was written by Sherron Watkins, the company's vice president of communications in charge of corporate investigations, employee relations and policy, Enron confirmed late Monday.
The existence of the letter was disclosed Monday afternoon by the House Commerce and Energy Committee, which is investigating the one-time market leader's collapse. 
Watkins had worked for former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, whose involvement with some of the off-balance sheet partnerships raised questions of conflicts of interest. Enron removed Fastow from his position in October after reporting losses related to transactions involving the Fastow partnerships. 
The letter released by the House committee raised questions about the secrecy and accounting of the off-balance sheet partnerships. 
"I am incredibly nervous that we will implode in a wave of accounting scandals," the letter said. 
Watkins said in the letter that other Enron officials "consistently and constantly" had questioned the accounting methods to senior Enron officials, and directly to Jeff Skilling, Enron's former president and chief executive. 
"Mr. Skilling flatly denies the allegations in the letter related to him," said Judy Leon, a spokeswoman for Skilling. 
On Oct. 16, Enron announced hundreds of millions of dollars in third-quarter losses and a writedown of more than a billion dollars in shareholder equity relating to the partnerships. The company filed for bankruptcy Dec. 2. 
Watkins' letter is the earliest known communication to Enron's CEO that the handling of the partnerships could prove disastrous for the company. 
Letter Writer In Position To 'Learn Things' 

Robert S. Bennett, Enron's attorney, confirmed that Watkins wrote the letter, but didn't immediately know the date. Skilling resigned from the company Aug. 14, citing personal reasons. Skilling said in an interview last month that he had no idea the partnerships posed any threat to Enron. 
Bennett said Watkins had worked closely with Fastow and was in a position to "learn things" about Enron. Bennett couldn't describe the extent of Watkins' work for Enron, nor could a company spokeswoman. 
"She wrote the letter, which was initially an anonymous letter, and when it came to Mr. Lay's attention he became concerned," Bennett said in an interview with Dow Jones Newswires. Lay "went to the general counsel to investigate and get to the bottom of it." 
Bennett said Watkins met Lay for an hour last August to discuss the concerns she brought up in the letter, and he said she left the meeting "quite impressed" when Lay said he would investigate the issue. 
Lay directed Vinson & Elkins, a law firm with offices in Houston, to look into the concerns raised by Watkins, but not to "second-guess" the accounting advice from Andersen, the committee noted. 
Vinson & Elkins concluded that "further widespread investigation by independent counsel and auditors" was unwarranted. But the firm warned that "bad cosmetics" involving the transactions and the decline of Enron's stock posed the "serious risk of adverse publicity and litigation." 
The House Committee on Energy and Commerce acted unfairly by releasing the letter, Bennett said. 
"It's very unfair to suggest the company was trying to whitewash anything," Bennett said. Lay "wanted an answer quickly and not spend a year with a law firm doing an inquiry. I think this shows that what Mr. Lay did is very responsible. If the law firm said an investigation was needed, then Mr. Lay would have agreed." 
Enron, however, made only scant reference to the partnerships on Oct. 16, when the company released its third quarter earnings, which included losses related to transactions with the partnerships. 
It was those losses combined with other disclosures that led to a loss of investor confidence and eventually led to Enron filing for bankruptcy in December. 
Letter Writer Asked To Be Reassigned 

Reached late Monday evening, Philip Hilder, Watkins' Houston attorney, said Watkins worked for Fastow for a couple of months last summer and asked to be reassigned in late August because she was concerned about accounting irregularities she witnessed related to the Fastow partnerships. Hilder wouldn't elaborate. 
"She worked for Mr. Fastow for a short period of time last summer. Maybe a couple of months," said Hilder, who worked for the Department of Justice and was a former federal prosecutor. "She asked to be reassigned." 
Gordon Andrew, Fastow's spokesman, said Fastow "would not comment at this time on any aspect of the investigation." 
Watkins, who had previously worked in the company's broadband division as vice president, has been subpoenaed by the Securities and Exchange Commission but hasn't testified yet, Hilder said. Neither the Justice Department nor the various congressional committees investigating Enron's collapse has subpoenaed Watkins, he said. 
"It's unclear when Watkins will testify before the SEC," Hilder said. 
Hilder said Watkins wasn't a stakeholder in any of the partnerships set up by Fastow nor did she benefit financially from them, but Watkins was "involved" in some capacity in the various entities, the extent of which Hilder wouldn't disclose. Hilder said the letter Watkins wrote to Lay didn't include a date and was, at first, anonymous. He wouldn't say what the events were that led up to her meeting with Lay last August, why she wrote the letter or how her identity as the author became known. 
While Enron's most recent roster lists Watkins as vice president of communications, Hilder said Watkins title was previously vice president of corporate development and that her title may have changed with the company's bankruptcy and restructuring.

Enron DIP Financing Now Likely Halved To About $700M
By Carol S. Remond

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Despite receiving no cash upfront from the spinoff of its core trading business, bankrupt Enron Corp. (ENE) now stands to get a smaller-than-expected interim financing package.
Bankers are putting final touches on a downsized debtor-in-possession, or DIP, financing deal under which the energy company will have access to up to $700 million to $800 million, people familiar with the situation said. 
That's half of what the company was first expected to receive. 
Enron confirmed earlier Tuesday that it has entered a trading partnership with Swiss banking institution UBS Warburg (U.UBS). Under the deal, UBS will acquire all of Enron's oil and power trading business without cash changing hands. UBS won't take on any of Enron's liabilities, but Enron will receive a 33% share of the new venture profits for at least two years. 
Under the original financing plan approved last month shortly after Enron filed for Chapter 11 protection in New York, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and Citigroup (C) had agreed to put together a $1.5 billion interim financing deal to help the company back on its feet. 
But continued apathy among bankers recruited to help J.P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup foot the bill has now resulted in a smaller financing plan. 

A first $250 million DIP installment was made available to the company in early December. Enron has yet to tap that credit line. 
An additional $250 million will likely become available over the next couple of weeks after J.P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup approve the energy company's new business plan. 
Additional financing above that $500 million is contingent upon other banks agreeing to participate in the deal with J.P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup. 
Enron's new business plan, which was provided to the banks in early January, has not been made public. But people familiar with the situation said the company now has between $400 million and $500 million in available cash. 
That better-than-anticipated cash position is also cited as one of the reasons behind the DIP downsizing. 
Final approval of the DIP, which is crucial for Enron to continue operating, is now scheduled for Jan. 30. 
Once they approve Enron's new business plan, J.P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup are expected to float a syndication term sheet to other large banks. The banks first approached other financial institutions in mid-December, with the original $1.5 billion financing deal, but found that most were reluctant to take on more exposure to Enron. 
J.P. Morgan Chase's exposure to Enron stands at $2.6 billion. Meanwhile, Citigroup's Enron liabilities are believed to be around $1 billion.

Enron Executives, Andersen Sued By Shareholder

01/15/2002
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Executives of bankrupt Enron Corp. (ENE) were named as defendants in a class-action lawsuit filed Monday by an Enron shareholder in federal court in Houston. 
Also named as a defendant is Enron's auditing firm, Arthur Andersen L.L.P.
The Enron shareholder, Howard Bruce Klein, alleges "each of the defendants knew or recklessly disregarded the fact that...misleading statements and omissions would adversely affect the integrity of the market in Enron common stock. Had the adverse facts defendants concealed been properly disclosed, Enron's shares would not have sold at the artificially inflated prices they did," according to the filing. 
Enron and Andersen representatives didn't reply to phone messages left at their offices. In response to similar previous requests, Andersen spokesmen have declined comment. 
Klein is represented by Houston-based lawyer Tom Alan Cunningham. 
The Enron executives named in the suit are Chairman Kenneth Lay, former Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling and former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow. 
Nearly 40 shareholder class-action lawsuits are pending against Enron in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas in Houston. 
Enron filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in December after the company's equity collapsed in the face of revelations about of related party transactions involving executives including Fastow. The related party transactions kept hundreds of millions of dollars off Enron's balance sheet. The company is the subject of more than 60 civil lawsuits, congressional investigations and a federal criminal probe.

UBS won't pay anything in deal for Enron trading operation
By ALAN CLENDENNING
AP Business Writer

Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

NEW YORK (AP) - A Swiss investment bank won't pay anything to acquire Enron Corp.'s energy trading business nor assume any of the troubled company's debts but will share a third of the energy operation's profits with Enron and its creditors. 
Stamford, Conn.-based UBS Warburg, a division of Swiss banking giant UBS AG, and Enron will file for approval of the deal with the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department within five business days, according to documents filed Tuesday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan.
The plan to revive Enron's trading business calls for UBS Warburg to purchase the unit without paying any cash up front, said Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman. 
Enron and its creditors will initially get 33 percent of the new business' pretax profits and UBS Warburg the remainder, the documents indicate. After three years, UBS Warburg can begin to buy out some of those profit-sharing rights and eventually buy the rights to all of the profits. 
"This is an extremely positive deal for Enron and its creditors that confirms the substantial value of Enron's trading operation," said Enron chief financial officer Jeff McMahon. "We believe this is a first step among many towards an overall plan of reorganization and planned emergence from bankruptcy." 
Palmer said UBS Warburg is expected to lease Enron offices in Houston and employ about 800 of the division's workers. Court documents also indicated that UBS Warburg plans to lease Enron office space in Portland, Ore., Toronto and Calgary, Alberta. 
Enron's energy trading business generated about 90 percent of the company's $101 billion in revenue in 2000. The deal does not include existing contracts Enron has to supply power, valued at between $6 billion and $7 billion. 
Enron collapsed late last year amid revelations of complex partnerships used to keep billions of dollars in debt off its books and mask financial problems so it could continue to get cash and credit to run the trading business. 
UBS Warburg won the bidding for the trading operation, beating out Citigroup Inc., a large Enron creditor. 
The investment bank was selected after intense negotiations during a court-sponsored auction that began Thursday morning and ended more than 24 hours later. 
The deal with UBS Warburg is for 10 years, but allows the investment bank to to exercise a series of options to buy out Enron's profit-sharing agreement starting in the third year of the pact, Enron said in a statement. 
A creditors' committee approved the deal, but other Enron creditors have questioned it, saying they want more information about how the agreement was reached and how the proceeds will be allocated. 
The deal must be approved by Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez. A hearing is set for Friday. 
Some two dozen Enron creditors had already filed objections to the sale before the selection was announced. Dissatisfied creditors will have 10 days to appeal Gonzalez's ruling. 
Before its collapse late last year, Enron was the world's largest energy merchant and the nation's seventh largest company by revenue. Enron differed from competitors in its penchant for complex bets on everything under the sun - advertising space, broadband, paper, the weather and more than 1,000 other products. 
Trading of Enron shares, which sold for $83 a year ago but have changed hands at no higher than $1 since December, has been halted since Friday on the New York Stock Exchange pending the sale announcement. UBS' U.S.-traded shares fell 4 cents to $49.17 Tuesday morning on the NYSE.

Enron loans sting bank's bottom line

01/15/2002
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

CHICAGO (AP) - Northern Trust Corp. says losses on loans to bankrupt Enron Corp. have caused fourth-quarter earnings to fall short of Wall Street's expectations. 
Northern Trust reported net income fell 18 percent to $102.4 million, or 45 cents a diluted share, from $125.5 million, or 54 cents a share, during the same period last year. Thomson Financial/First Call said analysts expected the Chicago-based banking and financial-services company to report results of 54 cents per share.
Northern Trust says its results were dragged down by an increase in the amount of money set aside to cover potential loan losses, from $5 million to $45 million. On Monday, the bank disclosed it had $43.5 million in outstanding Enron-related loans, of which $24.6 million is in the form of loans unsecured by collateral. 
Chief Financial Officer Perry Pero said the bank has written off the $24.6 million in unsecured loans. 
Northern Trust was the trustee of Enron's 401(k) pension plan until the now bankrupt energy trader transferred in October to another provider. The bank held the assets but had no investment discretion, according to spokeswoman Sue Rageas. 
It was during the shift of trustees that a "lockdown" was imposed, barring employees from altering their plan holdings. The bank remains a co-defendant with Enron in litigation brought by Enron workers angry because they were not permitted to sell their Enron shares while their value was falling. 
Houston-based Enron filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last month after disclosing it used questionable bookkeeping practices to conceal the size of its debt. 
For the year, Northern Trust's net income was $487.5 million, or $2.11 a share, up from $485.1 million, or $2.11 a share, a year earlier.

CAPITAL VIEWS: Early Washington Noise On Budget, Enron
By John Connor

01/15/2002
Dow Jones Capital Markets Report
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

A Dow Jones Newswires Column 

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- The pace will pick up soon in the Nation's Capital in areas of interest to the business and financial communities.
Congress returns to work next week, with Congressional Budget Office Director Dan Crippen testifying Wednesday on the budget outlook before the Senate Budget Committee. The next day, a Senate committee will hold the first of many Enron hearings this year. 
President George W. Bush will deliver his State of the Union Address Jan. 29. 
And the Federal Open Market Committee will announce its latest monetary policy decision the following day, Jan. 30, which also will feature the Treasury Department's quarterly refunding announcement. 
President Bush will unveil his fiscal 2003 budget Feb. 4, which also is the day when Enron Chairman and CEO Kenneth Lay is scheduled to testify before two Congressional committees. 
On Feb. 12, the Senate Banking Committee will hear, in the context of the Enron debacle, from five former chairmen of the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
And sometime not long thereafter, in the latter part of February, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan will present what used to be known as his Humphrey-Hawkins testimony. 
Prospects of Congress enacting much if any meaningful legislation in this, an election year, are slim, but there should be no shortage of noise, particularly on the fiscal policy front as Democrats ask in wide-eyed wonder "who lost the surplus?" while Republicans accuse the Democrats of trying to raise everyone's taxes. 
Veteran budget observer Stan Collender of Fleishman-Hillard Inc., said preliminary expectations are that the Administration's budget and CBO's January forecast will show a fiscal 2003 deficit of between $10 billion and $25 billion. 
But he said those numbers aren't likely to include a variety of things that will add to the red ink, and warned that the fiscal 2003 deficit will be well above what is projected in January and February. 
"A (2003) deficit of $100 billion or more is not out of the question," Collender added. 
And somewhere along the line, perhaps sooner rather than later (the Treasury has cited February as a potential pressure point) the $5.95 trillion debt ceiling will have to be raised. 
On Enron, the old Watergate line of then Sen. Howard Baker, R-Tenn., - "what did he know and when did he know it" - is likely to get a thorough workout.

Lieberman Asked to Recuse Himself From Enron Probe

01/15/2002
PR Newswire
(Copyright (c) 2002, PR Newswire)

WASHINGTON, Jan. 15 /PRNewswire/ -- The following letter was sent today by Peter Flaherty, President of the National Legal and Policy Center to Senator Joseph Lieberman: 
I am writing to ask you to recuse yourself from any participation in the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee's upcoming hearing and consideration of the Enron case.
Last Thursday, Attorney General Ashcroft recused himself from the Enron case the same day he received a letter from Rep. Henry Waxman in which Waxman questioned the approximately $50,000 that had gone to committees affiliated with Ashcroft by Enron-related individuals and groups. 
As you know, the amount that you and committees affiliated with you received from Enron interests, Enron's top creditor -- Citigroup, Inc. and Enron's auditor, Arthur Anderson, dwarfed anything received by Attorney General Ashcroft. 
Enron contributed at total of $25,000 in 2000 to the group you founded, the New Democrat Network, according to IRS records. Also, Enron's biggest creditor, Citigroup, Inc. is listed as your largest single contributor ($112,546) for the period 1997-2002 by the web site Opensecrets.org, relying on Federal Election Commission records. Citigroup, Inc. also made $100,000 in contributions to the New Democrat Network in 2001. Arthur Andersen, Enron's auditing firm, contributed $20,000 to the New Democrat Network in 2001. 
In order to assure the public of the integrity of the Senate investigation and to avoid the appearance of a double standard, I hope you agree with me that recusing yourself is the only appropriate step for you to take.

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- The National Legal and Policy Center, or NLPC, asked U.S. Senator Joseph Lieberman to recuse himself from any participation in the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee's upcoming hearing and consideration of the Enron Corp. (ENE) case. 
In a press release Tuesday, the NLPC said Lieberman and committees affiliated with him received funds from Enron and Enron interests that made recusal the "only appropriate step" to assure the public of the integrity of the Senate investigation.
Specifically, the NLPC said the amount that Lieberman, a Democrat from Connecticut, and committees affiliated with him received far exceeded the roughly $50,000 that went to committees affiliated with U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft, who recused himself last week. 
Senator Lieberman wasn't immediately available for comment.

O'Neill says 'something clearly went awry' with Enron information disclosure

01/15/2002
AFX News
(c) 2002 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

NEW YORK (AFX) - Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill said something clearly went wrong with Enron Corp's disclosure of financial information, and employees of the firm will be punished if rules were broken. 
O'Neill said "something clearly went awry" in Enron's disclosure of financial information, in remarks to the National Retail Federation here.
In the US system of information disclosure, "individuals...are confident that they have the information they need to make sound decisions and the ability to act on that information as they see fit." 
But "in the Enron case, something clearly went awry," he said. 
"If anyone at Enron broke the rules, they will be punished," he concluded, noting the Justice Department's investigation.

USA: Treasury's O'Neill sees positive US economic signs.

01/15/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

WASHINGTON, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill said on Tuesday that he now saw some signs of positive growth among the mixed signals the U.S. economy was giving off. 
"The data that I'm looking at tell me the economy is and has been moving from a slow period to one where the data is kind of mixed and we are seeing some positives," O'Neill said on CNBC television.
"But I think the balance is now decidedly on the positive side and I think it foretells movement back into significant positive growth as we go through the year," he added. 
The Treasury chief, in New York to address a business group, said the economy should get a short-term lift simply from restocking inventories. After that, O'Neill added, "we need to kick in the investment side of business activity" to get a sustained recovery from recession that began last march. 
"But that's the uncertainty that we have, that the inventory reversal and movement back up will be followed by business investment picking up more of the???ed. 
In response to a question, O'Neill said he has not given up on reviving a package of economic stimulus measures to spur growth. A proposed package failed at the end of last year amid acrimony on Capitol Hill over how best to craft measures but O'Neill said he thought lawmakers might have changed their minds by now. 
If so, "we're very hopeful we can get it done in a few weeks," O'Neill added. 
He said there should not be a rush to judgment about what happened in the case of bankrupt energy trader Enron Corp. but said if it was shown that there were legal violations that contributed to its collapse, then there should be punishment. 
"I believe this: if people knowingly, intentionally violated the law, then they should be brought to justice," O'Neill said. Enron and its former officers are under investigation on several fronts. 
Enron was a major contributor to the successful presidential campaign of George W. Bush but gave money to both Republicans and Democrats who were seeking office. O'Neill said he was not concerned that Enron had undue influence over lawmakers or over the shaping of national energy policy. 
He said it was natural for people crafting energy policy and for lawmakers to talk to experts on the topic. 
"If you really followed the dictates of the people who are on the extreme edges of this, you would only talk to people who don't know anything, which doesn't seem to be a brilliant idea to me," O'Neill added.

Nevada Sen. Ensign on panel probing Enron

01/15/2002
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

WASHINGTON (AP) - Sen. John Ensign, R-Nev., who is among numerous lawmakers who took campaign money from Enron Corp., is also among those investigating the firm's collapse. 
Ensign took $7,500 in campaign contributions from Enron since 1989, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a campaign-money watchdog group.
Ensign is on the Senate Commerce Committee, and the panel's consumer affairs subcommittee, which is holding hearings on Enron's collapse. 
Ensign said the contributions "absolutely" wouldn't hinder his ability to rigorously investigate how Enron plummeted into bankruptcy and left investors, including company employees, holding nearly worthless stock. 
Ensign stressed that the Justice Department was the lead Enron investigator. 
"As it appears, fraud took place," Ensign said. "If that's the case, Justice needs to put some people in jail. It's very unfortunate that we had people perpetrate this sort of thing, especially when you are dealing with employees and the top people were trying to protect their own rear ends." 
Ensign also said the Bush administration should be lauded for not stepping in to help Enron, whose executives gave sizable donations to the president. 
As many as eight congressional committees plan to look into Enron, but Commerce was among the first to get started. Seventy-one senators and 188 House members - more than half of Congress - got money from Enron, according to the center. 
One other Nevada lawmaker has taken money from Enron in recent years: Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., got $1,000 in 1998. Reid doesn't sit on any committee that intends to investigate the Enron debacle.

Enron, which lobbied for corporate tax repeal, faces Congress probe over its own tax returns
By CURT ANDERSON
AP Tax Writer

01/15/2002
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

WASHINGTON (AP) - Enron Corp., which led a lobbying campaign to repeal a corporate tax as it neared collapse, will undergo scrutiny in Congress of its own tax returns to determine if shelters or other practices may have concealed its financial condition. 
Repeal of the alternative minimum tax sought by Enron was included by President Bush in an economic stimulus package and passed by the House, which added a provision that would have given Enron a $254 million infusion of cash. The package ultimately failed.
Now, Senate Finance Committee investigators are "interested in whether Enron has been complying with federal tax laws" said the panel's spokesman, Mike Siegel. 
Whether Enron used any shelters viewed by the Internal Revenue Service as set up mainly to avoid paying taxes is one key point. Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa, the top committee Republican, said the issue is "whether Enron used certain tax vehicles that might have masked the company's financial condition." 
Enron, the Houston-based energy conglomerate, faces investigations from a growing list of congressional committees, the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission following its collapse late last year in the nation's biggest corporate bankruptcy. The Finance Committee is one of two congressional panels with access to Enron's tax records. 
Even as its failure loomed last fall, Enron maintained a high-profile lobbying effort on a variety of tax issues. Enron led the AMT Coalition for Economic Growth, a business group dedicated to repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax, which is intended to guarantee that companies pay at least a minimal amount of income taxes. 
Bush also pushed for repeal in his economic stimulus package, arguing that the provision hits corporations hardest in down years. 
The administration disclosed Tuesday that Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay+ telephoned Mitch Daniels, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, in early October to discuss prospects for passage of the stimulus measure. 
The two had a general conversation about the legislation and discussed the overall outlook for the economy, said OMB spokeswoman Amy Call. Repeal of the alternative minimum tax was not addressed, she said. 
Enron stood to gain handsomely from language added to the stimulus package by Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. Under the original House-passed bill, billions of dollars in alternative minimum tax credits built up over past years by dozens of corporations would have been immediately redeemed - handing Enron a $254 million infusion of cash. 
Several corporate lobbyists say Enron was focused on prospective repeal of the tax, not the immediate refund of past credits. Thomas endured fierce criticism from Democrats for proposing the refunds, which he contended would enable struggling corporations to hire more people or boost investments. Other companies, including IBM and General Motors, would have gotten much larger refunds than Enron. 
David Wyss, chief economist at Standard & Poor's Co. in New York, said in any event the money would have done little to help Enron overcome its sinking credit rating and sliding stock price. 
"Maybe they could have staved off bankruptcy for another month," Wyss said. "But it would not have solved their problem." 
Senate Democrats blocked the Republican stimulus package. A second version, again passed by the House and endorsed by Bush, did not include the alternative minimum tax repeal or the immediate refund. 
Enron sought numerous other tax breaks from Congress, according to lobbyist disclosure records. Among them was a five-year extension of a tax credit for electricity generated by wind; Enron is a major producer of wind-generated power. 
An Enron affiliate, Enron Wind, provided a sample letter on its Internet site that people could send to members of Congress advocating extension of the credit. 
Like the stimulus package, however, extension of the wind credit failed to clear Congress and expired on Dec. 31. Lawmakers of both parties say it will be renewed for at least another year and probably made retroactive to the beginning of 2002. 
Enron would also have benefited from provisions of a House-passed energy bill involving oil and gas transmission lines, including tax breaks for certain transmission transactions. Those items would have helped the bottom lines of many other companies, too - and the bill also languishes in the Senate.

Fired Andersen Executive Says He Followed Company Orders
By Judith Burns

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- David Duncan, fired by Arthur Andersen Tuesday for his alleged role in destroying documents on Enron Corp. (ENE), was only following orders from Andersen's own attorneys, a spokesman said.
"Mr. Duncan is cooperating with all investigations of this matter. He did nothing wrong. He followed the instructions of an Andersen in-house lawyer in handling documents," the spokesman said. 
Andersen dismissed Duncan, saying it found widespread destruction of Enron-related materials after he called an Oct. 23 meeting. 
Chicago-based Andersen said an Oct. 12 memo from a company attorney on the firm's document retention policy doesn't appear to have prompted the destruction of electronic and paper records related to Enron.

USA: UPDATE 1-Fired Andersen partner to meet investigators Wed.
By Jeremy Pelofsky

WASHINGTON, Jan 15 (Reuters) - David Duncan, who was fired on Tuesday by auditor Andersen for his alleged role in destroying documents related to its review of Enron Corp.'s books, will meet with congressional investigators on Wednesday, a spokesman for the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee said Tuesday. 
"Mr. Duncan will be meeting with our investigators tomorrow," said Ken Johnson, the spokesman told Reuters on Tuesday. The panel has been probing Andersen's role in the collapse of the energy trading giant last fall.
"Frankly, now that he's been fired, he may be a little more motivated to be cooperative," Johnson said. "Prior to being terminated, he delivered six boxes of personal files and records to the committee and we're in the process of reviewing them right now." 
Earlier on Tuesday, Andersen said thousands of e-mails and large numbers of paper documents related to Enron were destroyed shortly after lead partner Duncan learned on Oct. 23 of a request by the Securities and Exchange Commission for information about the audit of Enron. 
Duncan could not be reached immediately for comment. 
The House Energy and Commerce Committee also said it would meet later with Sherron Watkins, the Enron executive who wrote a letter to Chief Executive Kenneth Lay last August in which she raised concerns about the company's accounting. 
"We're in the process of setting up a meeting with her," Johnson said at a press briefing. FIRST STEP TO ASSIGN BLAME 
The firing of Duncan was the first public step by the accounting firm to assign individual blame for the problems with its Enron audits. The Houston-based energy giant last month filed for the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history. 
Three other partners responsible for the Enron work were placed on leave by Andersen. 
"This is a useful beginning, but there is much more to be done," Rep. John Dingell, the ranking Democrat on the House panel, said in a statement read by his spokeswoman. 
The collapse of the company came after posting its first quarterly loss in more than four years on Oct. 16, as it took $1 billion in charges against earnings and cut shareholders equity by $1.2 billion. 
Enron debt was listed under partnerships, considered special-purpose entities, in effect keeping the debt off its own books. Andersen was responsible for auditing the company's balance sheets. 
Earlier on Tuesday, the New York Stock Exchange formally suspended trading in Enron shares and related securities while moving to delist the stock. Its shares last traded for 67 cents on Jan. 10, far below the record $90.56 hit in August 2000.

ROUNDUP Andersen fires Enron auditor who knowingly destroyed documents

01/15/2002

(c) 2002 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

NEW YORK (AFX) - Arthur Andersen LLP said it has fired the leading partner on its Enron audit after it discovered he ordered documents to be destroyed even after learning that the Securities and Exchange Committee wanted to see them. 
The Big Five firm said it has dismissed David Duncan and sent three other partners involved in the case on administrative leave.
Andersen said its initial probe of the Enron matter revealed that Duncan ordered employees to destroy thousands of emails and numerous related papers. 
"These activities were on such a scale and of such a nature as to remove any doubt that Andersen's policies and reasonable good judgment were violated," the firm said. 
The effort began following an urgent meeting that Duncan called on Oct 23, shortly after learning that Enron had received a request from the SEC for information on its financial accounting and reporting. 
"This effort was undertaken without any consultation with others in the firm and at a time when the engagement team should have had serious questions about their actions," said Andersen. 
The firm denied that an Oct 12 e-mail referring to company policy in document handling or any other conversations it knew of around that time had authorized the activity. 
Most of the emails and documents were destroyed in the days following that meeting, although the activity only ended after the lead partner's assistant sent an e-mail to other secretaries on November 9 -- one day after Andersen received a subpoena from the SEC -- telling them to "stop the shredding", said the firm. 
Andersen reiterated its statement of last week that it has successfully retrieved some documents from electronic backup systems, and said it is attempting to restore more. 
The firm also said that is installing new management in its Houston offices, where the audit team was based. 
Andersen managing partner and chief executive officer Joseph Berardino said: "We promised to be forthright and to take action where appropriate. This was a painful decision, but it was absolutely the right thing to do. We are prepared to take all appropriate steps necessary to maintain confidence in the integrity of our firm." 
Arthur Andersen said it would dismiss anyone found to have improperly destroyed audit work papers as well as any employee found to have purposefully deleted Enron-related e-mails or destroyed Enron-related documents after having been informed of the November 8 subpoena. 
"Based on our actions today, it should be perfectly clear that Andersen will not tolerate unethical behavior, gross errors in judgment or willful violation of our policies," said Berardino. 
Andersen's revelations came shortly after the New York Stock Exchange said it is delisting Enron shares with immediate effect. 
It attributed the move to the "expected protracted nature of the company's bankruptcy process and the uncertainty at this time as to the timing and outcome of this process as well as the ultimate effect on the company's common shareholders." 
The shares have also fallen below the exchange's one usd threshold for more than a month. 
Enron shares have been halted from trading for the past several days pending the announcement of details of the company's sale of its wholesale energy trading unit to UBS Warburg. They last changed hands at 67 cents. 
Earlier, Enron said that UBS Warburg will not pay any cash upfront to acquire the unit, but will instead pay Enron royalties equal to 33 pct of the unit's income for 10 years. 
UBS Warburg has a series of options that allow it to begin buying out Enron's royalty interest in the third year of the agreement. 
Following the exercise of the first call, the royalty payment rate will drop from 33 pct to 22 pct. A second option in the fourth year would lower royalties payments to 11 pct. The final option in the fifth year would allow payments to cease altogether. 
If UBS Warburg decides not to exercise these series of options, the royalties will increase from year five through 10. 
UBS is acquiring a staff of about 800 people along with the company's computer systems and hardware. 
Additionally, as Enron lawyers made clear on Friday, the company's trading book is not part of the deal. 
The book contains Enron's derivatives trading positions, which will be slowly unwound. 
The deal still requires approval by Judge Arthur Gonzalez of the US bankruptcy court in the Southern District of New York. 
The court is expected to announce that decision on Friday.

Arthur Andersen fires chief Enron auditor; 3 other partners sent on leave

01/15/2002
AFX News
(c) 2002 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

NEW YORK (AFX) - Arthur Andersen LLP said it fired David Duncan, the lead partner on its Enron Corp audit, and will send three other partners involved in the case on administrative leave. 
Arthur Andersen said the three partners to be sent on leave are Thomas Bauer, Debra Cash, and Roger Willard, who were all asssigned, along with Duncan, to its Houston offices.
The accounting firm said its probe of the Enron matter revealed that thousands of emails were destroyed and numerous related papers rushedly destroyed after the US Securities and Exchange Commission issued a subpoena for such documents on Nov 8. 
The destruction of the Enron-related documents was ordered by Duncan, it said. 
Arthur Andersen said it believes that its own policies of "reasonable good judgment" were violated by the four partners. 
Arthur Andersen said its inquiry into the destruction of the Enron-related documents is continuing and that additional persons, beyond the four identified today, are being probed. 
It said it will take action against any employee found to have purposefully deleted Enron-related audit work papers, emails or documents after learning on Nov 8 that such materials were being subpoenaed by the SEC. 
It reiterated its statement of last week that it has successfully retrieved some documents from electronic backup systems, and said it is attempting to restore more such documents. 
The accounting firms said the dismissal of Duncan and the placement of the other three partners on leave were based on "preliminary facts relating to Andersen's inquiry into the disposal of documents related to the action." 
Arthur Andersen also said it is installing new management in the Houston offices. 
Arthur Andersen managing partner and chief executive officer Joseph Beradino said: "We promised to be forthright and to take action where appropriate. This was a painful decision, but it was absolutely the right thing to do. We are prepared to take all appropriate steps necessary to maintain confidence in the integrity of our firm."

USA: Business group wary of new regs from Enron case.
By Peter Kaplan

01/15/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

WASHINGTON, Jan 15 (Reuters) - The head of corporate America's biggest lobbying group on Tuesday said the government should not rush to impose new business regulations in the wake of Enron Corp.'s collapse. 
Thomas Donahue, the president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said the organization would oppose any immediate, "radical overhaul" of laws and regulations stemming from the Enron debacle.
"We have seen one problem with one company and one accounting firm, and with it everybody is rushing to judgment and rushing to: 'We've got to pass legislation,'" Donahue said at a press briefing on the Chamber's 2002 agenda. "Pray we don't until we know what we're talking about." 
Houston-based Enron filed the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history on Dec. 2. Its auditor, Andersen, has said its employees destroyed documents related to the former energy giant's balance sheet. 
Enron's collapse has prompted a criminal probe by the Justice Department. The Securities and Exchange Commission and Labor Department are also investigating. 
President George W. Bush ordered a review headed by Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill of U.S. pension and corporate disclosure rules to avoid a repeat of the energy trading firm's collapse, in which thousands of employees lost their retirement savings. 
Meanwhile, some lawmakers in Congress are eyeing possible legislation to protect investors and employees from similar breakdowns in future. 
Sens. Jon Corzine, a Democrat from New Jersey, and Barbara Boxer, a Democrat from California, have proposed a law limiting how much company stock can be put into employees' 401(k) plans. Sen. Paul Sarbanes, a Democrat from Maryland, has asked the General Accounting Office to look into the adequacy of financial reporting and employee retirement plan rules. 
Florida Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson has said he also is considering legislation to protect 401(k) account holders' rights to sell shares when they want. And the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has proposed new requirements for reporting on derivatives and hedge funds. 
Another Chamber of Commerce official at the briefing said the organization does support a bill by Ohio Republican Rep. John Boehner that would let retirement plans providers offer investment advice to individual plan members. 
But Donahue, of the Chamber of Commerce, said the president and Congress should move cautiously when it comes to more radical measures. He characterized the Enron collapse as an isolated case and said there are already rules and regulations in place to protect investors. 
"Let's not start reinventing the process," Donahue said. "Let's adjudicate the process that's in place." 
"After that's done, if there's a habitual problem in American industry and the American accounting industry because of that then we have to change the system," Donahue said. "Right now there is no such habitual problem." 
Donahue said class-action attorneys "are lining up now to see if they can line their pockets on behalf of some number of shareholders from anybody they can target on this."

USA: US official sees Enron slowing energy mart change.

01/15/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

WASHINGTON, Jan 15 (Reuters) - The Enron Corp. debacle won't end federal and state efforts to further restructure U.S. energy markets, but it will slow the process for the next two or three years, a top Bush administration energy official said on Tuesday. 
"I think we've gone too far to go back," said Vicky Bailey, Assistant Secretary of Energy for International Affairs and Domestic Policy.
Bailey, speaking to reporters at a U.S.-Canada energy conference, said that Enron's problems along with last year's California energy crisis will drag out the process of bringing more competition to the nation's electricity market. 
"You've got the bookends of the California crisis and Enron. It doesn't help," Bailey said. It slows (restructuring efforts) down for probably two or three more years." 
Bailey said it was unfortunate that the Enron fiasco would effect energy restructuring, because energy issues were not the cause of the company's downfall. 
"The Enron issue is a financial issue, banking issue, accounting issue," she said. "It shouldn't be the death knell for energy legislation, because that's larger than Enron." 
During the seven years that Bailey served as a member of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, she said Enron officials were "out front" and "aggressive" in pushing to open U.S. energy markets to competition. 
"There was nothing wrong with that. We needed somebody out there championing that," said Bailey, referring to Enron. 
With congressional scrutiny of Enron, Bailey said she did not think another energy firm would be willing to step in any time soon to become the new cheerleader for restructured energy markets. "I think you'll see a fair amount of timidness," she said.

Power Trading Business Could Be Good Fit For UBS Warburg
By Cheryl Winokur Munk and Christina Cheddar

01/15/2002
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- UBS Warburg's winning bid for Enron Corp.'s (ENE) power trading business could prove to be a good strategic move for the Swiss investment bank, analysts said.
The purchase of Enron's trading operations marks UBS Warburg's entry into a new business line that adds to its experience in equity and fixed-income trading. The deal is in line with UBS's stated goal to expand its U.S. market share, a focus since its 2000 purchase of brokerage firm PaineWebber Inc. 
"It will be a valuable extension of our worldwide trading activities," said John Costas, chief executive of UBS Warburg in a recent statement. 
Enron's demonstrated track record and high-quality traders offer "potentially a very complimentary fit to the trading operations of a brokerage firm," said Gene Pisasale, senior investment officer with Wilmington Trust Co. 
Although observers are skeptical that the trading unit could reclaim its top dog status in the power trading industry, UBS's backing could revive the business that has been virtually dormant since Enron's bankruptcy in early December. 
Putting UBS's name behind it should eliminate concerns about the soundness of the business, said John Leonard, an analyst with Schroder Salomon Smith Barney in London. 
"I don't think that UBS is taking a lot of risk," said Romain Burnand, European bank analyst at J.P. Morgan in London. He said UBS's risk seems to be limited to potential negative cash flow if the trading activity does not resume quickly enough. 
A spokesman for UBS Warburg, a unit of UBS AG (UBS), did not immediately return telephone calls seeking comment. 

Still, there are questions about just how much business Enron's old trading operation can recapture under UBS control, given the already crowded industry playing field. Enron had about 20% of the market, said Leonard of Schroder Salomon Smith Barney. 
UBS will be armed with Enron's technology and the talent of some of its employees. According to a person familiar with the transaction, UBS is expected to keep between 500 to 800 of Enron's employees. 
The staff will include executives who ran Enron's trading floor, but not any of Enron's corporate employees, the person said. 
Since trading is a relationship business, the retention of key staff is an important part of the picture. However, there are concerns among industry watchers that Enron's staff may have lost important momentum in the weeks that Enron's business wasn't operating. 
"Enron's trading business was so big," said Commerzbank Securities analyst Andre Meade. "It had such a big market share that it had an information advantage that is unlikely to persist." 
Also, having gone through the painful adjustment of having to operate without Enron, some customers may be hesitant to go back, according to Meade. 
Indeed, the energy market has moved on since Enron's abrupt exit and typically new entrants in the energy market have had difficulty obtaining top-tier status. However, since many energy traders have credit ratings below A-level, UBS may have an edge over its competition, some industry observers said. 
UBS is rated Double-A-Plus, and good credit goes a long way in the energy market. 
"It's a question of stability," said ABN AMRO energy analyst Paul Patterson. "What you find is that it gives (trading partners) more confidence." 
The importance of confidence among trading partners cannot be overstated. Many likened Enron's own collapse to a run on a bank. As the trading parties rushed to unwind their deals, Enron's situation began to spiral out of control. 
Historically, energy traders with Triple-B credits haven't been penalized, for their lower credit ratings, but that situation may be evolving post-Enron. 
For that reason, it is important for UBS to maintain its status, observers said. 

UBS hasn't indicated whether it will seek a separate rating for the trading business, as is the case with many energy trading companies. 
A person familiar with UBS said the credit of UBS' trading business will likely be considered along with the credit of its parent. However, credit rating agencies will make the final determination. 
Officials from Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service weren't immediately available to comment. 
Eileen Fahey, a banking industry analyst for Fitch Investors Service, said the addition of the trading business adds an element of risk to UBS's profile. 
"It's a new business for them. They had scaled down their commodities trading," she said. However, the analyst sees the move as consistent with UBS Warburg's strategy of becoming a large, core investment bank. 
Furthermore, UBS has the advantage of buying "a premiere platform," according to Fahey. 
Historically, the strength of the UBS credit rating has been based on the strength of its private client business and the support of the Swiss government, she said. However, neither of these strengths are applicable to the energy trading business. 
Fitch's review will look closely at how much capital the business will require, how much liquidity the business can generate and in which areas will the company focus. These details are unknown at this time. 

Reached later, UBS spokesman David Walker declined to provide details about the new venture until after the bankruptcy court hearing to discuss the deal on Friday. He did, however, say UBS is hoping to get the business up and running in 30 days, providing it gets all the necessary approvals. 
According to a person familiar with the transaction, UBS only expects to trade gas and power, and will abandon some of the other business lines Enron previously traded such as pulp and paper, metals and weather-risk. 
Fitch's Fahey expects UBS will be best suited to trade short-term contracts for power and gas. UBS could have difficulty competing for long-term contracts because physical assets and logistical experience are important advantages the firm will lack, she said. 
Long-term contracts, however, tend to be the most profitable. According to Commerzbank's Meade, short-term contracts reap profit margins in the "single digits." 
Without pipes and wires, the UBS trading business also will have difficulty trading some short-term contracts that rely on assets, Meade said. These include ancillary services such as spinning reserve, or energy a power plant needs to have as an operating reserve.

USA: UPDATE 1-US lawmaker seeks Enron pension, accounting probes.
By Kevin Drawbaugh

01/15/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

WASHINGTON, Jan 15 (Reuters) - The chairman of a powerful Senate committee probing Enron Corp.'s collapse on Tuesday requested investigations into financial reporting and employee retirement fund investments in company stock, matching a White House call last week for reviews in the same areas. 
Maryland Democratic Sen. Paul Sarbanes asked Congress' investigative arm to look into laws governing employee stock ownership in retirement funds such as 401(k) plans, as well as how corporations report their finances to the public.
In a move that will bring the hard-hitting General Accounting Office into the debate over regulatory responses to the Enron affair, Sarbanes kept up Congress' push for answers on how Enron collapsed by focusing on two key policy issues. 
"Accurate and honestly presented financial information is essential to the efficiency of our capital and security markets, yet in recent years costly accounting irregularities have proliferated," Sarbanes, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said in a statement. 
Houston-based Enron filed the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history on Dec. 2, and last week the Justice Department launched a criminal probe of the company. The Securities and Exchange Commission and Labor Department are also investigating. 
A sharp decline in Enron's share price last fall sapped the savings of thousands of the fallen energy trader's employees whose 401(k) accounts were heavily invested in Enron stock. Similar losses have been seen in recent years at other firms. 
"Investment of retirement funds in company stock can enable employees to share in the fruits of their labor - as reflected in a company's stock price. However, the reported results of Enron's bankruptcy raise significant issues about the adequacy of our laws and their enforcement," Sarbanes said. 
President George W. Bush, who got major campaign support from Enron and its top executives, last week called for reviews of retirement fund and financial reporting rules, as well. 
Sarbanes asked the GAO "to evaluate the governance system of the accounting profession in the United States and consider the extent to which defects in that system may have contributed to or increased the risks of such irregularities," he said. 
Questions about Enron's financial reports and their review by its auditor, Andersen, are at the heart of the SEC probe. 
Chicago-based Andersen also audited the books of other companies that later disclosed bookkeeping irregularities, such as Waste Management Inc and Sunbeam Corp. 
The accounting profession largely regulates itself through the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. 
Sarbanes has scheduled a banking committee hearing for Feb. 12 on Enron. Five other congressional committees are looking into Enron, with other hearings set for Jan. 24 and Feb. 4.

Enron debacle costs state millions of dollars

Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

SANTA FE (AP) - The collapse of Enron Corp. cost four of New Mexico's largest investment funds $54.5 million - less than 1 percent of their values, officials said. 
The losses did not significantly affect the land grant and severance tax permanent funds, the Education Retirement Board investment fund or the Public Employees Retirement Association fund, investment managers said.
Enron, an energy-trading company, entered the biggest corporate bankruptcy in U.S. history on Dec. 2, leaving countless investors burned and thousands of employees out of work. 
"I'm sorry we got into it," Phil Archibeck, chief investment officer for the state Investment Council, said of the Enron holdings. "Nobody knew the stock would be hit that way." 
The land grant and severance tax permanent funds lost $26 million - one-quarter of 1 percent of the funds, which are worth a combined $12 billion, he said. 
"This (Enron) was not a large holding related to the size of the funds," Archibeck said. "Although you hate to lose the money, the portfolio was diversified." 
The Education Retirement Board investment fund lost about $20 million - about three-tenths of 1 percent of the $6.5 billion fund, said Frank Foy, the fund's chief investment officer. 
"It's a big hit, but it's not going to hurt the fund," he said. 
The PERA fund lost $8.5 million - less than one-tenth of 1 percent of the $8 billion fund, said Bob Gish, PERA's chief investment officer. 
"This shouldn't cripple the fund in any way," he said.

Forbes.com Exclusive; Enron: the Wrong Focus

01/15/2002
Business Wire
(Copyright (c) 2002, Business Wire)

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--January 15, 2002--Everyone seems to be focusing on how Enron hid its debt by allocating it to supposedly independent private partnerships. But perhaps the real focus should be on Enron's creation of revenues. 
In "Enron The Incredible," Forbes.com staff editor Dan Ackman explores how Enron booked its revenue and how incredible its reported performance was. Some of his findings:
-- A practice called gross accounting rather than net accounting 
led Enron to get away with reporting such huge numbers, 
appearing to "outperform the world." 

-- Compared to companies with similar sales, Enron's revenue per 
employee was $5.3 million, more than triple Goldman Sachs 
($1.7 million). And Microsoft's revenues-per-employee, were, 
by contrast, $610,000. 

-- Compared to companies with a similar number of employees, 
Enron's revenue per employee was more that four-times Chevron 
and more than 13 times Micron Technology

Nation & World
Farewell to all that

U.S. News & World Report

Even with all that has attended the implosion of energy giant Enron Corp., last week's disclosure was seismic: As the company hurtled toward the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history, Chairman Kenneth Lay picked up the phone and called two cabinet members, telling one he would welcome government help. After considering Enron's plight, Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and Commerce Secretary Donald Evans say they declined to step in. 
It's not unusual, of course, for even the closest of political friends to melt away in the face of an ally's death spiral; the company is now virtually radioactive in Washington. But for Enron, which has spread money freely in political circles and enjoyed an outsize reputation as one of the capital's most powerful players, this ultimate denial was less a denouement than another chapter in a less appreciated story: Despite several big policy wins, Enron may not have been the political juggernaut its extraordinary connections suggested.
Pushing into an expanding array of businesses, Enron had sharply escalated its lobbying attack in Washington in recent years, boosting its spending by a stunning 400 percent since 1996. It had buttressed a small army of highly paid lobbyists with nearly $6 million in campaign contributions since the 1990 elections. And then there were all those close ties to the Bush administration. 
Undeniably, Enron has enjoyed considerable success in Washington. Both House energy legislation and Vice President Cheney's national energy plan include key Enron provisions, such as speeding up approval for new energy facilities and encouraging electricity deregulation. In 1993, with the backing of Wendy Gramm, then the chairwoman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the wife of Texas Sen. Phil Gramm, Enron fended off stronger regulation of energy derivatives, the complex financial instruments on which it built its trading empire. (Just weeks after the CFTC vote, Wendy Gramm joined Enron's board of directors; Phil Gramm, a Republican, counts Enron as his top corporate contributor, and, as former chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, he helped thwart energy trading regulations.) Enron had strong input in the appointment of the chair of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, who has backed regional electricity transmission groups--a central part of Enron's business plan. 
Despite these victories, however, Enron suffered significant political setbacks before the curtain came crashing down. It couldn't, for example, persuade the Bush administration to push for telecommunications providers to open up their networks--something that would have allowed Enron to provide high-speed services, like movies on demand. "In the energy world, they had a lot more chips on the table to play with," says one former Enron lobbyist. "In [others], they had to negotiate their way in--they were like a start-up." 
Enron tried hard. Even by Washington's revolving-door standards, its lineup of former government officials was impressive: former top energy regulators, members of Congress, key congressional staffers, top White House officials, influential tax writers, and officials from the Treasury, Commerce, State, and Defense departments. But Enron's collapse, which has cost investors billions of dollars and employees their jobs and savings, has fanned partisan flames because of the company's remarkable ties with the Bush administration. Bush officials who have worked for Enron include economic adviser Lawrence Lindsey, Trade Representative Robert Zoellick, Army Secretary Thomas White, and Commerce Department general counsel Theodore Kassinger. Bush himself counts Enron as his biggest single benefactor, hauling in nearly $625,000 in contributions over the years, according to the Center for Public Integrity. Lay has personally donated at least $883,000 to candidates, about 90 percent Republicans. 
A vivid example of Enron's Bush connections is newly disclosed details of meetings between Enron officials and the vice president and his aides, including while Cheney was drafting the administration's hush-hush energy policy. Cheney had previously acknowledged a half-hour meeting with Lay. But last week, the White House said Cheney aides met five other times with Enron officials last year. The final meeting occurred a little more than a week before the company said it was writing off $1.2 billion--news that touched off its bankruptcy. 
Empire building. Enron's sharpest increase in lobbying coincides with Bush's arrival in Washington. But as the company's agenda expanded, it was forced to ramp up its Washington efforts to protect its interests in the new territories. Early last year, for instance, company lobbyists began working the administration on steel and trade protection--part of Enron's attempts to extend its trailblazing empire into steel products. 
But Enron failed to derail legislation that would require trading firms to disclose more information about their activities. It could only watch as the FERC waded into California's electricity crisis with price controls. The company suffered a setback when the president bailed out of the Kyoto Protocol, which calls for capping greenhouse-gas emissions. Such limits would help the company trade pollution credits while also giving a boost to natural gas, which could help Enron's pipeline business. Enron was also frustrated in its push for national retail competition in electricity. "They had a lot of relationships," says a former Enron lobbyist. "But when it came to making things happen, they couldn't exert enough influence." 
In Washington, seldom does an interest win all the time, but Enron's failures have come in crucial areas. The company also didn't help itself with what some saw as an abrasive style. "There was a sense of entitlement--`We are Enron, dammit,' " says one former company lobbyist. He said the company swept its offices for bugs and hired private detectives to follow competitors, including Jeffrey MacKinnon, a utility lobbyist. "It's amazing what they were willing to do," MacKinnon says. 
Meanwhile, even before last week's developments, investigation of Enron's collapse was growing broader. On top of several congressional and regulatory probes, the Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation--although Attorney General John Ashcroft has recused himself, having accepted about $57,500 in Enron-related contributions for his failed 2000 Senate campaign. (The Justice Department's Houston office has also recused itself, citing too many homegrown ties to Enron.) Investigators are examining everything from the behavior of Enron's auditors to the impact of the crash on investors to the stupefying range of partnerships the company created to help pump up its earnings. Congressional investigators expect to receive millions of documents, and they are stepping up visits to company offices, U.S. News is told. 
Even Enron's past Washington successes may be fleeting. Though Enron triumphed in the battle over regulating derivatives, FERC has effectively reopened the issue by considering new rules that would require energy firms to disclose more information about their derivatives exposure. When the Senate takes up its energy bill next month, lawmakers are expected to show new support for regulatory reforms that Democrats proposed even before the Enron crash. 
Concluding there was little Washington could offer, Enron all but shuttered its lobbying operation soon after filing for bankruptcy. As the company is learning, money and attitude may not guarantee success, but there's nothing like the stench of failure to bring the walls tumbling down. 
More questions for the auditor 
Vanishing Act 
The smoke around Enron's spectacular collapse is beginning to choke the bean counters. Arthur Andersen, the energy firm's auditor for 16 years, shocked investigators last week when it announced that some of its employees disposed of "a significant but undetermined number of electronic and paper documents and correspondence" relating to Enron in recent months. The firm said it did not know whether some of the destruction occurred after government investigations of Enron were underway; U.S. Rep. Billy Tauzin said such actions could be criminal and he would expand his probe. -M.B.

The Nation Enron Chief Was Warned of Problems Energy: A top officer's memo to Chairman Lay, found by congressional investigators, cautioned that 'funny accounting' practices could embroil the firm in scandal.

WASHINGTON -- Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth L. Lay was warned last summer by a company vice president that the energy company's financial practices might cause it to "implode in a wave of accounting scandals," congressional investigators said Monday. 
The vice president, Sherron Watkins, complained in an August letter to Lay and other senior Enron executives that a "veil of secrecy" surrounding the company's "funny accounting" of complex partnerships had not been adequately disclosed to the public and merited further investigation, according to excerpts from the memo.
The seven-page memo was found by investigators sifting through 40 boxes of Enron documents obtained from the company after it filed the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history Dec. 2. The investigators said it raises troubling questions about the extent to which Enron officers and the company's auditor, Andersen, were aware of the financial transactions and accounting practices that contributed to the energy giant's fall. 
But Robert S. Bennett, Enron's Washington lawyer, said Lay took the employee's concerns seriously--and, in fact, met with her and ordered an investigation. He said the review by an outside law firm found that "no further investigation was necessary." 
"This really isn't fair to the people under investigation," Bennett said. 
Since Enron's collapse, investigators have alleged that the Houston company used a network of partnerships to mask debt and make its balance sheet appear stronger. In mid-October, the company acknowledged accounting problems relating to those partnerships and slashed shareholder equity by $1.2 billion. 
Congressional committees are investigating whether Enron and its auditor withheld information from employees and investors that led to billions of dollars in losses as the company's stock plummeted. 
Investigators said they plan to interview Watkins, whom they declined to name publicly but who was confirmed as the author by her attorney, Philip Hilder. 
Watkins worked for Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow as vice president of corporate development. She wrote the memo anonymously, Hilder said, and then sought out Chairman Lay to express her concerns directly. 
"She doesn't perceive herself as a heroine; she was just doing her job," said Hilder, who said Watkins had written the undated memo in mid-August. After talking to Lay about it, Hilder said, she asked to be reassigned so she would no longer report to Fastow. 
Before Watkins joined Enron, Hilder said, she worked for Andersen--the accounting firm that has come under fire for not sounding alarms on Enron's precarious financial condition. 
Watkins, in her late 30s, still works for Enron in a variety of capacities, her lawyer said. Hilder said she remains on the job because she "felt loyalty to the company." 
"She's been there for eight years," he said. "It's very difficult to just pick up and leave if you have a disagreement." 
The excerpts from her August letter provide a window on an internal debate underway at Enron about the company's accounting practices before its problems were widely known. 
Watkins wrote that she had complained directly to Jeffrey K. Skilling, who resigned as Enron's chief executive Aug. 14. Skilling has denied any knowledge of the firm's financial problems. 
"Mr. Skilling flatly denies the allegations in the letter related to him," said Judy Leon, a spokeswoman for Skilling. 
The memo was written about the time that Lay was reassuring investors and telling employees that Enron would eventually see "a significantly higher stock price," according to one Aug. 27 e-mail from Lay released last weekend. Instead, Enron's stock plummeted as investors grew more concerned about the controversial partnerships. On Dec. 2, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. 
Ken Johnson, a spokesman for the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said the memo "clearly shows that top Enron executives, including Kenneth Lay, were warned of serious financial problems months before the company reduced shareholder equity." 
"What's also troublesome is that some people may have tried to hide the truth or simply did not want to know it," Johnson said. 
According to excerpts from the memo released Monday, Watkins questioned the company's accounting methods for numerous partnerships involving Fastow and for other "special purpose" entities. 
Fastow was replaced Oct. 24. On Nov. 8, the company announced that it had overstated its profit since 1997 by $586 million. 
But as early as August, several senior Enron employees were "consistently and constantly" questioning the company's accounting methods and use of stock swaps with related entities, Watkins wrote. 
"It sure looks to the layman on the street that we are hiding losses in a related company and will compensate that company with Enron stock in the future," she warned. 
House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.) and Rep. James C. Greenwood (R-Pa.), chairman of the subcommittee on oversight and investigations, sent letters to Enron, Andersen and the Houston law firm Vinson & Elkins seeking records on their review of the concerns. Tauzin questioned whether Enron officers had instructed Vinson & Elkins not to second-guess "the accounting advice and treatment provided by" Andersen. 
The review by the outside attorneys concluded that the concerns did not warrant "further investigation by independent counsel and auditors," given that they raised no facts that had not either been known or disclosed by company executives and auditors, according to congressional investigators. The firm, however, warned of "a serious risk of adverse publicity and litigation," investigators said. It was unclear when the firm completed the review. 
A spokesman for Vinson & Elkins said the firm is reviewing the request for information. 
Separately Monday, Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.), who chairs the Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, added his panel to the growing list of those looking into the Enron matter. 
Sarbanes has asked five former chairmen of the Securities and Exchange Commission to testify at a Feb. 12 hearing that will explore accounting and investor protection issues surrounding the problems with Enron and other public companies, such as Waste Management and Sunbeam Corp. 
The panel will include Arthur Levitt Jr., Richard C. Breeden, David Ruder, Harold M. Williams and Roderick M. Hills. A spokesman for Sarbanes said Enron's collapse, which wiped out the retirement savings of thousands of employees and cost investors billions of dollars, has brought investor protection to the forefront of the legislative agenda. 
The senator also asked the General Accounting Office on Monday to investigate how Enron's employee funds were handled. 
The banking committee's ranking Republican is Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, whose wife, Wendy, is on Enron's board of directors. 
In another development, Andersen, known until last year as Arthur Andersen, said an Oct. 12 memo sent by the accounting firm's in-house lawyer "never told the audit team that they should destroy documents for past audit work that was already completed." Time magazine reported this week that the memo directed the destruction of Enron documents in possible violation of the law. 
Congressional investigators were focusing on the memo in the hope it would explain why Andersen had destroyed what they termed a "significant" number of documents related to Enron.

PAT KIERNAN, CNNfn ANCHOR, THE MONEY GANG: Congressional investigators say an Enron (URL: http://.www.enron.com/) employee warned the company`s chairman about the company`s accounting practices months before the firm filed for bankruptcy. The Enron executive wrote an internal letter of warning that said problems could, as the memo explained it, implode the company. 
ALI VELSHI, CNNfn ANCHOR, THE MONEY GANG: Yesterday the top Enron story concerned another memo. This one from a lawyer for Enron`s auditor, Arthur Andersen. A congressional committee note authorized the destruction of documents pertaining to Enron. "Time" magazine`s Wall Street correspondent, Dan Kadlec, broke that news over the weekend he joins us know for a look at this and everything else that we can fit on Enron into the next few minutes.
DAN KADLEC, "TIME": You talk about smoking guns. You know, destroyed evidence and memos that were ignored by the chairman of the company, if not ignored at lease not given proper attention to. I mean, these things really opened the door to broader issues and possibly charges. You know, it`s been serious all along but this is really getting hot now. 
KIERNAN: The auditors know better. 
(CROSSTALK) 
KADLEC: You`ve got this pattern with Arthur Andersen, you know, their behavior in this case is obscene anyway. But you go back and you got this pattern with the fines and the penalties they`ve paid Waste Management (URL: http://www.wastemanagement.com/) and Sunbeam (URL: http://www.sunbeam.com/) , you know, it just looks like a pattern for doing business at this place and there`s serious question whether the firm`s even going to survive at this point. 
ALI VELSHI, CNNfn MONEY GANG ANCHOR: All right. Now the smoking gun unfortunately doesn`t tell us what -- what we`re missing. It doesn`t tell us whether these are even material documents. Do we know that in effect that they are? 
KADLEC: We don`t know. We don`t know. Odds are the material stuff has been saved. Okay. That`s beyond -- we don`t know if a few things were ditched down here or not. Mostly what has been gotten rid of is emails and informal memos but these are the kinds of things that an investigator would love to have. 
KIERNAN: Yeah. 
KADLEC: . because you`re a little more revealing in an offhanded comment or an email that things that show motivation and intent and this stuff is now missing. I mean, what they have are the work papers but what`s that but just. 
VELSHI: Presumably drafted by people who know not to break the wrong things exactly. 
KIERNAN: From the prospective of the investor the audit is very important in that it is the shareholders advocate in the financial process making sure that everything is as it appears to be and the accounting firms have been very successful in convincing regulators that they don`t need to be regulated. 
KADLEC: This whole concept of self-policing is under a black cloud. I mean, we saw it all this year and last with the analysts, I mean, Wall Street and IPOs and underwriting are supposed to be a self-policing mechanism, well it didn`t work there. You know, the auditors are supposed to self-police but they have this thing called peer review. I mean, please that just means that I`m looking at what you`re doing and. 
(CROSSTALK) 
KADLEC: . and you know, next -- you know, you`re going to do the same thing for me next week. So, you know, you`re really inviting additional oversight and Congressional inquiries, there`s just no ending where this thing is going to go. 
VELSHI: Where does the word scandal or conspiracy -- at what point do you start looking at that? Could this just be ineptitude on two separate parts, both Enron and Arthur Andersen and they just both happen to coincidentally be doing the wrong thing at the same time? 
KADLEC: I mean, that gets to the question of who knew what and when. 
VELSHI: Right. 
KADLEC: But it`s the age-old question. The pattern -- on the evidence we see it suggests that somebody knew something and was trying to hide it. I mean, that`s a far as we can go, you know, more evidence is sure to come out. 
VELSHI: Enron`s best defenses that this happened -- not Enron, but Andersen`s best defense is that this has happened to them before. Sloppy. 
KADLEC: Let`s face it, other accounting firms have missed things and it`s not a bad defense. I mean companies that want to hide something can hide it and an auditor may not be able to pick it up every time. But the fact that they were paid a million dollars a week to work for this company, there`s just a lot of things that don`t look good. 
KIERNAN: Dan Kadlec, Wall Street columnist, "Time" magazine. Thanks for being here. 
KADLEC: OK.

Andersen`s Role in the Enron Collapse

ALI VELSHI, CNNfn ANCHOR, THE MONEY GANG: We`re continuing on, on the Enron (URL: http://.www.enron.com/) topic. One of the early shareholder lawsuits against Enron and Arthur Andersen comes from Amalgamated Bank . 
PAT KIERNAN, CNNfn ANCHOR, THE MONEY GANG: This case raises a lot of questions about whether small shareholders were left out of the loop about the worsening financial condition at Enron.
William Lerach is one of the lead lawyers for Amalgamated and he joins us from San Diego. Thanks for being with us, Mr. Lerach. 
WILLIAM LERACH, ATTORNEY, AMALGAMATED BANK: Thank you. 
KIERNAN: Bill, let me start by asking you just to summarize exactly what your allegation is and what the lawsuit hopes to achieve as far as compensation. 
LERACH: Amalgamated Bank, a union-owned bank that manages the pension moneys of working people, janitors, laborers, workers, suffered a large loss as a result of the fraud at Enron. The lawsuit alleges that Enron and Arthur Andersen artificially inflated the reported profits of Enron by over $600 million and overstated Enron`s net worth or shareholder equity by over $1 billion during a three-year period. During which 29 top officers and directors personally profited by selling off 1.1 billion shares of their Enron stock at inflated prices, all of this in violation of the federal securities laws. 
VELSHI: Now, noted attorney Robert Bennett working on the Enron side says there`s no proof that any of these 29 executives did anything wrong. What`s your response to that? 
LERACH: Mr. Bennett is being well paid to try to put a positive spin on an impossible situation. This is the largest dose of insider trading we have ever encountered in the 30 years that we`ve been prosecuting these kinds of cases and remember, Enron has now admitted that its financial statements contained hundreds of millions of dollars of phony profits during the time those executives were selling off their stock. If those executives didn`t know it, it was only because they deliberately closed their eyes to what was in front of them. 
CHRIS HUNTINGTON, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT, THE MONEY GANG: William, if I could just ask you a practical question: 
Now that Enron is in bankruptcy protection and certainly you guys out there in the shareholder lawsuit community are seeking class action status, can you just walk us through some of the mechanics of when you might achieve class status, when you might actually get a hearing on your case, when you might actually potentially see some money for your clients? 
LERACH: Well, first of all, the case is actually moving forward rapidly. Amalgamated Bank has made an emergency motion to the court to freeze the $1.1 billion of insider trading proceeds. Remember, Enron is bankrupt. So Enron won`t be able to pay any money. So we`re trying to attach these insider trading proceeds so they`ll be there at the end of the day when we win the case to fund a recovery or a settlement. 
Now the court has ruled in a big victory for Amalgamated Bank that the court has the power to grant this extraordinary remedy. Next what we`re going to do is trace where that $1.1 billion is and if we find out that it`s in offshore bank accounts or otherwise being secreted, then the court, in my opinion, will probably attach it. As the case goes forward, it will take some months for the complaint to be upheld by the court and for class certification status to be obtained but that will all happen later this year. 
VELSHI: You know, you may make a good legal argument and may get a ruling in your favor in the end but what - if we have to go through that entire process of finding out what happened to the proceeds of that $1.1 billion, finding out if they`re offshore, getting the court to attach it, what is the actual chance of recovery in the end? 
LERACH: Oh, there`s a very good chance of recovery here for the victims of this fraud. The Enron officers and directors, in addition to the insider trading money, are covered by $400 million of directors and officers` insurance. In addition, Arthur Andersen, while it`s in a terrible fix, is a very profitable enterprise with over $9 billion of revenue a year and as this case expands and unfolds, several other defendants, many of whom will be institutions with large resources and large insurance, are surely going to be added to the case as defendants. 
HUNTINGTON: How do you account for the fact that shareholders and employee pension funds happily rode Enron`s stock price up to $90 a share and it really, with the exception of the lock down period when the funds were - the 401(k) was shifting administrators, there was really nothing to prevent folks from selling their Enron shares for quite some period of time. 
LERACH: Of course - of course nothing to prevent them from selling their shares other than the fact that the company was representing that it had never been more profitable, lying, that the company was representing that its future had never been brighter, lying, and the securities analysts were - who were, by the way, employed by the investment banking firm, so we`re getting hundreds of millions of dollars from Enron to peddle Enron bonds and stock to the public were issuing ever more rosy analysts` forecasts. How can you fault the victims? All the investors were doing was what investors are supposed to do. Look at the information the company and the analysts give you and if it looks good, believe it and invest. 
VELSHI: William Lerach, thanks very much for joining us here on THE MONEY GANG. 
LERACH: Thank you. 
VELSHI: William Lerach is the managing partner at Milberg Weiss. They`re representing Amalgamated Bank in its suit against Enron. 
KIERNAN: Our thanks to Chris Huntington as well.

Commentary Bush to Lay: What Was Your Name Again?
ROBERT SCHEER
Robert Scheer writes a syndicated column.

If you believe President Bush, Kenneth Lay--one of his top financial backers and his "good friend"--was merely an equal-opportunity corrupter of our political system, buying off Democrats and Republicans as needed. It is a convenient claim designed to unlink Bush from the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history. 
But, as the good ol' boys in Texas--and now Bush spokesman Ari Fleisher--like to say, "That dog won't hunt."
On Friday, Bush attempted to distance himself from the Enron scandal by stating that CEO Lay "was a supporter of Ann Richards in my run in 1994," obscuring the fact that Lay gave Bush three times as much money as he did the Democratic gubernatorial incumbent whom Bush was trying to unseat. Bush added that he really did not get to "know" Lay--the man he nicknamed "Kenny Boy"--until after he won the governor's race. 
I can't speak to the varying levels of intimacy of their relationship, but Bush had considerable contact with Lay two years earlier when the Enron leader served as the chair of the host committee for the 1992 Republican convention in Houston, where Bush the senior was nominated for his second term as president. 
At that time, Investor's Daily reported that "recently, Lay has turned Enron into a corporate bastion for the GOP." After the elder Bush's defeat, the Bush family switched its political ambitions to George W.'s prospects for governor, and Lay came up with the first of many contributions to that effort. 
Lay's loyal support of the Bushes may have been gratitude for the decisive role that the first Bush administration played in Enron's meteoric rise. Building on the Republican-engineered deregulation of the electricity industry that began in the 1980s, Enron got a huge boost during the first Bush administration with passage of the 1992 Energy Act, which forced utility companies to carry Enron's electricity on their wires. 
In fact, Lay publicly thanked Bush with a column in the Dallas Morning News a week before the 1992 election. Calling Bush "the energy president," Lay wrote that "just six months after George Bush became president, he directed Energy Secretary James Watkins to lead the development of a new energy strategy." That resulted in the legislation making Enron's exponential growth possible. 
Lay was effusive in expressing his gratitude, writing that the Bush "strategy is the most ambitious and sweeping energy plan ever proposed." 
That gift to Enron was coupled with a major exemption granted by Wendy Gramm, then chair of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission in the Bush administration, an exemption that permitted Enron to begin lucratively trading energy derivatives. Gramm then joined the board of directors of Enron and served on its auditors committee, where much of the false reporting now being exposed seems to be centered. Her powerful role in the company did not stop her husband, Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas), from pushing through legislation that further weakened government oversight of Enron's activities. 
After Bush the elder's defeat in 1992, the ties between Enron and the Bush camp grew even stronger. In March 1993, Enron hired Bush's Commerce secretary, Robert A. Mosbacher, and his secretary of State, James A. Baker III, to line up contracts for Enron around the world. As Enron's representative, Baker--later George W.'s Florida election strategist--even went on a trip accompanying the ex-president to Kuwait to do big business in the nation Bush had fought the Gulf War to save. 
The trip was criticized by Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, who said that he had turned down millions in proffered deals to do business in Kuwait after the war. 
"I represent 540,000 American men and women, not some private company," said Schwarzkopf. "They were willing to die in Kuwait. Why should I profit from their sacrifice?" 
A decade later, the new Bush administration turned immediately to Lay to get his bearings on an energy policy. Lay met with Vice President Dick Cheney's energy group six times. This was no surprise, given the close ties between Lay and Bush during the latter's days as Texas governor. Consider, for example, that as governor, Bush did not hesitate to call then-Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge and assure him that Lay--then eager to deregulate Pennsylvania's electricity market--was the finest of men, representing the most worthy of companies. 
Keeping true to family traditions, the president has always aggressively supported far-reaching deregulation of utilities--it is, in fact, his political mantra--and Enron appears to be the biggest benefactor of that philosophy. Whether the contacts between them were actually illegal and not merely an egregious betrayal of Enron's employees, shareholders and consumers, it remains for the eight investigations planned or underway to reveal what Bush and White House insiders knew, and when they knew it.

Commentary When Going Gets Tough, the Tough Shred
DANIEL SCHORR
Daniel Schorr, senior news analyst for National Public Radio, won three Emmy awards for his coverage of Watergate.

It was Watergate in the 1970s and Irangate in the '80s. Will Enrongate become the national scandal of the new century? 
"Gate" has become a metaphor for the corrupt use of power. It remains to be seen whether the Bush administration, consorting with a giant corporation, contributed the regulatory laxity that made possible the victimization of employees, investors and the nation.
Now, as in the past, investigators will have to cope with the cover-up impulse, which is not limited to government officials. For months, the Bush White House has resisted providing the General Accounting Office--the investigative arm of Congress--with data about the workings of Vice President Dick Cheney's energy task force, which produced anti-regulatory policy recommendations much to Enron's liking. The GAO has filed an unprecedented lawsuit against the White House, trying to pry loose the information. 
Yet much of the information is buried in the files of the bankrupt corporation and its accountants in the Andersen company. With a free-enterprise whiff of Watergate, Andersen has now acknowledged that "individuals" disposed of "a significant but undetermined number of electronic and paper documents" related to Enron. The destruction apparently continued after a subpoena had been received from the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
This "Quick-Henry-the-shredder" reflex took me back three decades to June 1972. On the morning after five burglars had been caught in Democratic headquarters in the Watergate office building, G. Gordon Liddy, chief of the enterprise, drove to the office of the Committee to Reelect the President on Pennsylvania Avenue and started shredding files. He shredded everything connected with the project--including hotel soap wrappers and even $100 bills from illegal campaign funds. 
A week later, L. Patrick Gray, acting director of the FBI, was called to the White House and told by Nixon aide John Erlichman to "deep-six" the contents of the safe of H. Howard Hunt, Watergate operative, in the Executive Office Building. "Deep-six" meant that Gray was to drop the contents off the Potomac bridge. Gray chose to keep the material in his home and burn it six months later. 
The prize Watergate suppression was, of course, the erasure of 18 minutes of a discussion between President Nixon and Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman on a tape subpoenaed by the Watergate special prosecutor. From the context it appears that Nixon and Haldeman were discussing who ordered the break-in and why. Nixon denied making the erasure. His new chief of staff, Alexander Haig, testified to some possible "sinister force." 
Fast-forward to 1985 and the explosive revelation that the Reagan administration had been dealing with the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's Iranian government to trade antitank missiles for Tehran's help in recovering Americans held hostage in Lebanon. A further development was that proceeds of the missile sales were diverted to support the anti-Communist Contras in Nicaragua. 
Atty. Gen. Edwin Meese ordered an investigation, and immediately Oliver North, the National Security Council staffer managing the enterprise, started shredding. Into the machine he fed paper copies of electronic messages, telephone logs--everything. 
At one point the pile next to the shredder stood 1 1/2 feet high. When the shredder jammed, North went around the building looking for another secure shredder. North's secretary, Fawn Hall, spirited some particularly sensitive papers out of the White House hidden in her clothes. 
Adm. John Poindexter, head of the NSC, tore up the "intelligence finding" bearing President Reagan's signature that authorized the arms shipments. 
During the Clinton administration there was some shredding, tampering and temporary removal of documents related to the investigation that started with the failed investment in the Whitewater Development Co. in Arkansas. White House counsel Bernard Nussbaum was criticized for transferring Whitewater files from the office of lawyer Vincent W. Foster Jr. after Foster's suicide. 
But, unlike Watergate and Irangate, Whitewater was not a scandal that threatened the rights and livelihoods of Americans. Enrongate could be such a scandal, and so it's time to take notice when you hear the shredder at work.

Re "White House's Failure to Sound Alarm Faulted," Jan. 13: Criticism of the Bush administration for not sending a warning to investors about Enron's impending collapse seems more the product of political motivations than sound reasoning. Putting the federal government in the business of providing investment advice would surely create great potential for mischief and conflicts of interest. Private investors and their professional advisors are responsible for the wisdom of their investments. 
The federal government is not without responsibility. If the laws regarding disclosure are inadequate, the Congress can fix that. If companies do not comply with the laws, the federal government can take legal action. Best of all, the Senate should stop its irresponsible behavior and enact meaningful campaign finance reform. And the president should fix the National Labor Relations Board, if Congress lets him, so that it enforces the Supreme Court's 1988 Beck decision preventing unions from improperly using members' money for political purposes. Without that, campaign finance reform would be problematic. The culprit in this issue is really the Congress.

Re "Resist Revenge," editorial, Jan. 13: Don't think of it as revenge; it is simply fairness and the search for truth. Bill Clinton's presidency was sabotaged by conservatives who hated him for his intelligence, humor and good looks. If George W. Bush's presidency folds because, with his involvement in the oil business, a conflict of interest appears, it is his own fault and not some plot by liberals.

When running for president, Bush promised that, if elected, he would bring a new morality into the government. With the Enron scandal, the country did not have to wait long. But with Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft, etc., jumping ship, who will be left to prosecute Enron?

Re "Auditor Says It Destroyed Enron Records," Jan. 11: Even though I'm a layman, I know to keep my personal tax records for seven years in case I'm audited. Why have the accountants for Enron destroyed thousands of tax and business documents? Something to hide? 
Was Bush's name involved in these transactions? Or how about the other high-ranking officials who have since bowed out of the investigation due to possible conflicts of interest; did they make enormous profits selling shares as the everyday employees were restricted from selling their shares as they slid from $80 to worthless?

Re "Compassionately Conserving Enron," Commentary, Jan. 10: Arianna Huffington is fast becoming the patron saint of fair play. The Enron debacle is a microcosm of the Bush administration's indifference to average citizens' endeavor to provide a cushion for the autumn of their lives. Greed, the cancer of capitalism, must not be allowed to run rampant while the members of the ruling classes hide in their bunkers, counting out their millions. If "it's the people's money," the slogan of the man who swaggered into the White House, then give it back to the people who are now hurting. And watch that "lockbox," the working man's last vestige of security.

Enron Could End Up Where It Started Energy: The auctions of assets would remove core businesses, leaving a pipeline operator.

Enron Corp.'s proposed sale of its core energy-trading business to UBS Warburg, raises the question: Without its crown jewel, what is Enron? 
Until only a few months ago, the Houston-based company was the world's largest energy trader and was pushing its vision of deregulated markets into new states and new commodities.
But now, under bankruptcy court protection, Enron is frantically unloading assets, including its once-dominant trading operation, its Oregon utility, its best natural gas pipeline and a variety of international assets. 
If all of these deals are completed, Enron could end up much as it began, a smallish operator of scattered pipelines. 
The heady days when Enron tried to dominate the energy world and the halls of power are over, and its financial meltdown will haunt for years whatever company survives in the form of lawsuits and investigations. 
"Without these assets, Enron is not much," said utilities analyst Andre Meade of Commerzbank Securities in New York. 
"It's going to be a very small entity. My guess is Enron just gets liquidated and never emerges from bankruptcy ... or they might get acquired," Meade said. 
Enron, recently 21,000 employees strong, has fired 6,200 workers and will jettison even more in the months ahead through asset sales and more expected layoffs. A company spokeswoman Monday could not say how big the resulting company would be and how many people it would employ. 
Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne acknowledged the shrinking of Enron but said that "the pipelines are a self-sustaining business." Enron began in 1985 as a traditional natural gas pipeline operator, so "we'll be coming full circle," she said. 
The latest unloading of assets is the auction of Enron's trading business to UBS Warburg, the New York-based investment banking arm of Swiss financial services firm UBS. UBS won a bidding war Friday for Enron's trading operation, which once handled an estimated 25% of all the wholesale energy trading in the nation. 
Enron and UBS were working to complete details of the agreement Monday and delayed filing documents detailing the agreement with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. 
Enron will sell the entire operation to UBS Warburg, rather than the 51% ownership stake it previously was said to be negotiating, according to published reports. UBS Warburg would pay no cash up front for the business but would give Enron 33% of any pretax profit generated by the trading business for at least two years. 
Enron has all but closed its trading operation, which employs about 850 people and in 2000 generated 90% of the company's nearly $101 billion in revenue. The sale does not include any existing contracts for commodities, which are valued at more than $6 billion. 
Bankruptcy Judge Arthur Gonzalez will hold a hearing on the proposed sale Friday, one day later than previously planned. 
Although Enron's creditor committee backs the sale to UBS Warburg, some other creditors are objecting because they fear that profits would find their way to Enron and not to creditors, who are owed more than $31 billion. 
Enron recently agreed to let Dynegy Inc. buy the 17,000-mile Northern Natural Gas Pipeline, which Enron had pledged as part of the failed $9-billion takeover by its small cross-town rival. 
Dynegy pulled out of the agreement Nov. 28, the day Enron fell into junk-bond status, with Dynegy contending it had not realized the depth of Enron's problems. 
Dynegy is getting the pipeline for $23 million on top of the $1.5 billion in capital it had invested in Enron as part of the takeover agreement. But Enron was mired in an all-but-fatal cash crunch as investors and trading partners fled, and it filed for bankruptcy law protection Dec. 2. 
Enron still hopes to regain that pipeline as part of a $10-billion lawsuit it filed against Dynegy for pulling out of the merger. 
Enron also owns all or part of three smaller pipelines. The largest is Transwestern Pipeline, which operates 2,500 miles of pipe between Texas and the California border. Other Enron businesses include energy marketing and services, which sells electricity, natural gas and energy-management services primarily to business customers who want to bypass the traditional utility. 
Enron is selling assets including its Portland-based utility, Portland General, and international power plants and other assets. 
Enron's trading business was well-regarded and if it can be resurrected, it could give Enron a stream of profit "that would be a nice little start of a business," said Chris Ellinghaus, utility analyst with Williams Capital in New York. 
"The trading business has a lot of credibility to win back," Ellinghaus said. "But that was the part of Enron that actually worked. It was all those other things that they got into that got them into trouble" including investments in water and telecommunications ventures. 
"If they had just stuck with the core business, they would have done just fine," Ellinghaus said.

Ex-Enron Execs Launch Firm to Market Energy

PHILADELPHIA -- Several former Enron Corp. executives launched Monday a firm to market energy services to small and medium-sized businesses instead of large industrial customers the bankrupt giant had sought. 
Celeren Corp. was negotiating the final details of an expected $15-million deal with its first customer, a New York firm, and expected to announce that deal by the end of next week, said President Thomas A. Brigger.
Brigger, Celeren Chief Operating Officer Donald S. Parker and others left Enron in July to organize their new venture, well before the Houston-based energy trader rocked the financial world with its Oct. 16 disclosure of a $638-million third-quarter loss and its bankruptcy filing Dec. 2. 
Brigger had been mid-Atlantic regional manager for Enron Energy Services' outsource fulfillment operation, and Parker had been mid-Atlantic regional director of asset risk management. 
"The group we were with, Enron Energy Services, was doing very well. Our group had nothing to do with accounting," Brigger said.

Compaq, HP Detail Retention Bonuses Merger: Packages are designed to keep important employees during integration of the technology companies.

Hewlett-Packard Co. and Compaq Computer Corp. would shell out $634 million in bonuses to key employees as an incentive to stay on board if their merger goes through, the companies disclosed Monday. 
Hewlett-Packard would pay $33.1 million to 10 top executives and $337 million to about 6,000 selected employees over two years, according to an updated merger prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Compaq would pay $22.4 million to seven top executives and $242 million to an undisclosed number of employees over two years, the filing said. 
The companies disclosed in their original prospectus on Nov. 15 that HP Chief Carly Fiorina had turned down a merger-related bonus package that would have been worth $8 million, and that Compaq leader Michael Capellas forfeited a $14.4-million plan. Both companies said the CEOs wanted to avoid the appearance of conflicts of interest as they fight hard for the deal. 
The retention bonuses are designed to keep important employees during the difficult integration of the massive technology companies. HP has 86,000 employees; Compaq has 66,500. At least 15,000 layoffs are expected if the deal goes through. 
HP's bonus plan was crafted by board members Sam Ginn, Phil Condit and Walter Hewlett, the co-founder's son who originally voted for the deal and is now encouraging shareholders to torpedo it. 
Compaq's retention package was developed by directors Lawrence Babbio, Judith Craven and Kenneth Lay, the head of shattered Enron Corp. Lay resigned from Compaq's board last month. 
HP and Compaq say their $24.2-billion deal is essential for their long-term growth and would bolster their position in servers, data storage, personal computing and high-tech services. The companies expect merging would save at least $2.5 billion a year by 2004, or $5 to $9 a share. 
Opponents believe the deal is too risky, would shrink the contribution of HP's profitable printing division and overexpose the company to the weak personal-computer market. Hewlett and Packard family interests with 18% of HP shares are against the deal. 
Palo Alto-based HP and Houston-based Compaq are awaiting regulatory approval before setting a date for a shareholder vote. 
European regulators have until Jan. 31 to announce a decision on the deal or to inform the companies they need more time to study it. 
HP shares fell 36 cents, about 1.5%, to $22.52 on the New York Stock Exchange, while Compaq lost 36 cents, or 3%, to $11.14, also on the NYSE.

As he prepares for his State of the Union address January 29, President Bush is riding high. His war against terrorism is going well, he signed a compromise education bill into law last week, and he has rediscovered his cowboy swagger, declaring that Congress will raise taxes only "over my dead body." More than 80 percent of Americans approve of his job performance. 
But there's trouble ahead. Americans are turning their attention from Osama bin Laden back to domestic problems, especially the recession and unemployment, and Democrats are again attacking Bush on an issue that has plagued him from the start: his coziness with big business and his strong policy tilt toward corporate America. Making the problem markedly worse for the White House is the growing furor over the collapse of Enron Corp., the once mighty energy firm with close ties to Bush and the GOP. Last week, the Justice Department began an investigation into possible wrongdoing--the latest in a series of congressional and media probes into a financial debacle that, at minimum, raises questions about whether big corporations and rich contributors have unfair access to the administration (story, Page 22). "You expect a Republican president to be tied to the corporate interests," says Al From, founder of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council. "But George W. Bush said he'd be a different kind of Republican, and he hasn't done that. . . . Enron will take the halo off him."
Even Bush's advisers admit his current popularity has been inflated by a public desire to rally around the commander in chief, and they anticipate his approval ratings will soon begin to slide. As the nation returns to some semblance of normalcy, adds presidential historian Robert Dallek, Bush will pay a price for his lingering reputation as "the representative of big business and oil and gas and tax breaks for the rich. People are asking if he is just looking out for big business and his corporate friends." 
On domestic issues, says Dallek, Bush reminds him of Charles Wilson, President Dwight Eisenhower's defense secretary and the former president of General Motors, who in 1952 declared that what was "good for General Motors" was "good for our country." "Bush is cut from the same cloth," the historian says. " . . . But people have to feel the president is on their side, that he cares about them. And for Bush, the jury is very much out." 
With the midterm elections looming, pressure is growing on Bush to respond to the wishes of corporate America, which contributed generously to his 2000 campaign and remains a bulwark of Republican fundraising. To that end, White House counselor Karl Rove and other senior aides have been meeting privately with business leaders to assess what is doable this year. Among the possibilities, according to Bush advisers: relief from the corporate alternative minimum tax (already passed by the House and pending in the Senate); tax breaks on depreciation expenses and new capital investments; new protections from lawsuits; legislation to write off operating losses of some airlines and chemical companies; relaxation of workplace and environmental rules; and opposition to healthcare legislation that could raise costs for businesses. 
Bush-appointed regulators already are floating a proposal to relax air-pollution regulations at upgraded power plants--a move long sought by the energy industry, which has strong ties to Bush and Vice President Cheney. Both are former energy executives. Among those who sought the weakened standards was former Montana Gov. Marc Racicot, the incoming chairman of the Republican National Committee and Bush pal. All this has prompted Democratic members of Congress and the attorneys general of nine northeastern states to threaten to challenge the plans if they are implemented. Environmentalists are also up in arms. 
Pocket watch. It's part of a broader picture in which Democrats and their allies will make Bush's corporate attachments an issue in the midterm campaigns this fall--with the Enron case front and center. "Enron is a metaphor for the way they approach managing the economy," Democratic National Chairman Terry McAuliffe said in an interview. " . . . They're in the pockets of big business." 
The White House has a different explanation. "President Bush is a populist," Rove, Bush's chief strategist, told U.S. News. "For him the model is not the big corporation but the entrepreneur--the risk takers, the small-business people." 
The public doesn't see it quite that way. An ABC News/Washington Post Poll taken before the terrorist attacks found that 67 percent of Americans believe "large business corporations" have "too much influence" in the Bush administration; 64 percent said "the oil and gas industries" have too much power; and 72 percent said "wealthy people" are too influential at the White House. 
Not that the White House is upset by the corporate connections. Quite the contrary. Bush is proud of his background in private enterprise, as a Texas oilman and as managing partner of the Texas Rangers baseball team. He tells aides those experiences taught him a great deal about the economy and about the importance of keeping the business climate healthy. "It's not good for the country to bash business," says White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer. " . . . The fact is we all benefit from growth, and the more widely growth is spread in our society, the better it is for everyone." 
Related interests. A U.S. News review--reinforced by a new survey of the top 100 Bush appointees conducted by the nonpartisan, Washington-based Center for Public Integrity--shows that the administration is filling up rapidly with a substantial number of former CEOs, corporate lobbyists, and other top leaders of commerce and industry. Just as important, Bush has appointed a number of leaders from industry to key government jobs where they will be making policies that could benefit their former companies or the interests they represented. 
Of Bush's top 100 appointees, 34 came directly from for-profit businesses (even though some had served in government before) and 16 were from lobbying firms and law firms with significant lobbying operations, according to the center. An additional 27 were drawn from state, local, and federal governments; 19 were from nonprofit groups, including educational institutions and think tanks; four were from other categories. The center found that 20 of the top 100 officials in the administration have positions in departments or agencies that involve oversight of, or financial dealings with, their former private-sector employers or clients. At the time of their nominations, 57 had investments of $50,000 or more in companies with either regulatory issues or contractual business with the government. 
President Bill Clinton's administration also contained corporate leaders, among them former Goldman Sachs executive Robert Rubin as treasury secretary and former energy executive Mack McLarty as White House chief of staff. But Bill Allison, the center's managing editor, says Clinton drew more of his senior advisers from politics, government, organized labor, academia, and the think tanks. (A precise comparison with Clinton's appointees was not feasible, Allison says, partly because many records from the Clinton era were not available.) Allison adds: "This is not to say you should never ever pick someone from the business community or erect a wall of separation. It's a question of access and bias. Who are these people [in the Bush administration] listening to?" 
Not surprisingly, the business sector--particularly the energy industry--has a very loud megaphone. The top 100 Bush appointees collectively had the biggest concentration of their holdings in the energy sector, according to tabulations by the Center for Public Integrity. Other major sectors: metal and mineral industries as well as financial companies. 
At the vitally important second level of the administration, where many policies are hammered out--the subcabinet--the corporate connections are particularly apparent. In some cases, Bush has filled important subcabinet jobs with industry lobbyists and corporate executives who have a decidedly pro-business outlook. Among them: Agriculture Under Secretary Mark Rey, a former lobbyist for the timber industry who now has jurisdiction over the U.S. Forest Service, and Deputy Interior Secretary Steven Griles, a former lobbyist for energy, chemical, and waste-disposal interests who is a key figure in developing the administration's controversial energy policy that would encourage drilling on public lands. 
The subcabinet picks reinforce Bush's first round of corporate appointments, including Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill, former chairman and chief executive officer of Alcoa; Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, former CEO and chairman of G. D. Searle & Co., a pharmaceutical company, and General Instrument Corp.; White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card, former president and CEO of the American Automobile Manufacturers Association and former vice president of governmental relations for General Motors; and Commerce Secretary Donald Evans, former CEO of Tom Brown Inc., an oil and gas company with offices in Midland, Texas. 
Naturally enough, the corporate-oriented appointees have set a wide range of pro-business policies in motion. Among them: proposals to allow more energy development on public lands, including the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge; an ongoing re-evaluation of rules that limit road building in national forests; a rollback of ergonomic workplace standards opposed by many businesses; and opposition to the Kyoto Protocol, which would have required stringent action by business and industry to minimize climate change. 
Secret meetings. Coming under particularly heavy fire was Cheney's pro-development energy policy, formulated in secret meetings with business executives and lobbyists. Those meetings are the subject of a growing dispute between the White House and congressional Democrats who, through the General Accounting Office, are demanding a list of attendees. Says Allison: "This [energy policy] is the way energy companies believe this should work--it's the blueprint of the guys who think about development and drilling--and the question is whether or not government should take the same view as the oil companies." 
Another growing source of contention is Bush's economic stimulus plan, now stalled in the Democrat-controlled Senate. One provision backed by the White House would allow companies to write off 30 percent of their new investments annually for three years. Democrats favor a substantially lower tax break. Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle has tried to link such pro-business provisions to his larger critique of Bush's economic policy; he says that Bush's $1.35 trillion tax cut gave a huge windfall to wealthy individuals and that it's unfair to give similarly large breaks to corporations. 
While Bush has departed from conservative orthodoxy in some ways--spending more money on education, for example, and avoiding GOP "wedge issues" like crime and race--he has been more of a traditional conservative on domestic policy. Yet his views are firmly rooted in the GOP past. For most of the past century, the Republican Party was almost synonymous with corporate America. In 1925, President Calvin Coolidge declared famously, "The chief business of the American people is business." And in 1962, Dwight Eisenhower proudly called the GOP "the party of business." Says Republican pollster Frank Luntz, an informal adviser to the White House: "Republicans believe in free markets. That should come as a surprise to no one." 
Not that Bush has given business everything it wants. In 2001, he deferred consideration of corporate tax breaks in favor of individual tax cuts, and he has shown a willingness to allow patients to sue HMOs in state courts, which business interests oppose. (Bush has shown little interest in a capital-gains-tax cut because he doesn't believe Congress would pass it in the near future.) 
Yet business leaders are delighted with their new leader. "This guy is a Harvard M.B.A., he ran a lot of businesses, and he has a lot of guys on his staff who used to be in positions where they met a payroll," says Tom Donohue, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. "They've got an instinctive and practical understanding" of business's needs, Donohue says, adding that Bush was "fundamentally correct" and "courageous" in rejecting the Kyoto climate-change treaty as potentially harmful to the U.S. economy and in rolling back or reviewing some of Clinton's strongly pro-environment policies. 
Democrats believe that kind of praise from the business community can be turned to their advantage. "The public thinks his agenda is to fight for people in the boardroom and not the folks sitting behind computer screens or working in other jobs," says John Podesta, another former White House chief of staff for Clinton. "If things go badly and the economy stays soft, there's no sense he's in there `fighting for us.' " 
Such perceptions haven't had much effect on Bush's war-inflated popularity so far. But the situation could change--especially if Democrats succeed in arguing that special interests are benefiting from Bush's policies at Middle America's expense. That loss of faith could send his approval ratings tumbling and jeopardize his presidency--just as it did for his dad a decade ago. 
Some of the faces of `Bush Inc.' 
President Bush has been installing corporate leaders and lobbyists in prominent positions throughout his administration, especially at the subcabinet level, where many important policies are formulated and implemented. In the private sector, many of these appointees actively pushed for a pro-business agenda that included development of natural resources on public lands--an ongoing source of controversy in Washington and across the country. A new study by the Center for Public Integrity examines the backgrounds of the president's top 100 appointees.

Leavitt accepted $10,000 from Enron

Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

SALT LAKE CITY (AP) - Gov. Mike Leavitt met with Enron Corp. executives last year and solicited and received a $10,000 political contribution from the now-bankrupt energy giant. 
Leavitt said Monday that he met with Enron officials, including chairman Kenneth L. Lay, in the normal work of his office.
"I probably first bumped into Enron government affairs officials four or five years ago," he said. 
He does not recall who suggested last year that Enron receive a solicitation for his yearly $10,000-per-person fund-raiser, according to a copyright story in the Deseret News. 
"They do business in a number of Western states, although they don't operate in Utah to my knowledge," Leavitt said. 
The fund-raiser is sometimes used to help get GOP Western governors elected, so it makes sense the company would want to contribute, Leavitt said. 
Enron's check came in on Nov. 6. On Nov. 16, Enron officials met with Leavitt in his Capitol office to discuss energy policy, the governor said. 
Leavitt said he doesn't specifically recall what they wanted to talk about, although he surmises that they wanted to discuss transmission of electricity in the region. 
Enron, based in Houston, became a major player in Texas and national politics through connections with a number of politicians, including President Bush. Now, four congressional committees, several lawsuits and a federal criminal investigation are bearing down on Enron. 
Leavitt, who considers Bush a friend and political ally, invited Enron lobbyists to his $10,000-per-person Cast and Blast fund-raiser at his family's Loa ranch last September. After the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the event was rescheduled for November and turned from a weekend of fishing and hunting to skiing and skating. 
Fewer lobbyists and industry leaders attended the rescheduled event, but Enron's vice president of government affairs Paul Kaufman did, said Leavitt spokeswoman Natalie Gochnour. 
Lay is now being investigated for selling off $101 million of his Enron stock during the last year as Enron executives were sending out upbeat memos to Enron employees, whose pension funds backed by Enron stock would ultimately be lost in the company's bankruptcy. 
Leavitt said he never discussed Enron's money troubles with any Enron official. 
The $10,000 contribution came a month before Enron donated $100,000 to the federal Democratic Senate Committee the fund-raising PAC of Democratic U.S. senators. 
After Enron laid off thousands of workers and declared bankruptcy in December, the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history, the Democratic group announced it would donate the money to the laid-off workers. 
Leavitt has not decided what to do with Enron's $10,000, said Gochnour.

***********Enron excerpts only************
As the latest group of Taliban and al Qaeda prisoners arrived at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, human rights activists are questioning whether the makeshift prison meets with the spirit of the Geneva Conventions. A letter from an Enron employee to the company's Chief Executive recently came to light, and it reveals that this employee was aware that something was seriously wrong with the company's financial situation. Ken Burns discusses his new documentary, "Mark Twain." 
AARON BROWN, NEWSNIGHT CORRESPONDENT: And good evening again, everyone. I'm not exactly sure what it means, but the program tonight has more variety in it than any we've done in four months. There is war news and there is Enron news and both are interesting and important. But neither dominates the program. Maybe it's a sign of something, or maybe it's just a short break in both stories.
Enron, I'm absolutely certain, has a long way to go and I was troubled reading the e-mails that came in after Friday's program about accusations of bias. The accusations of bias were split, pretty much down the middle. Some felt we had gone too soft on the administration. Others felt, in the words of one writer, "we were licking our lips in anticipation of bringing the Republicans down." It is, I think, pointless to argue with either. The coverage was very careful. 
So I'll tell both sides in this, please relax, take a breath. Let's just see where this goes. It is very early in a complicated story. The business side is complicated. So is the politics. 
If there is a scandal there, if there is one, I hope we're the ones who uncover it. That's our business, but that's different from wishing for a scandal. We're proud of our coverage of the attacks on 9/11, but we didn't wish for it to happen. The right thing to do and what this program and CNN ought to do, is just keep on digging, and the digging has just started. 
So now, onto the whip we go on this 100 days since the war began, and the whip begins at the Pentagon, CNN's Bob Franken. Bob just back from Cuba, a headline please. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)*******************
While all of us are working to make sense of the Enron collapse, thank goodness for the company's auditors, Andersen. We may not understand the complexities of business accounting, but we do understand memos from lawyers telling accountants to destroy documents. 
William Sapphire of the New York Times today titled his column, Andersengate. As Sapphire put it, the accountants seemed to forget that the "P" in CPA means public. 
CNN Financial News Correspondent Allan Chernoff is here again to help us sort through this one, and there's plenty to sort through tonight. Allan. 
CHERNOFF: Aaron, tonight we have a new piece of the Enron puzzle. In fact, it is a letter from an Enron employee to the company's Chief Executive. The employee was well aware that something was rotten in Houston.

CHERNOFF (voice over): The letter to Chief Executive Ken Lay from an anonymous female Enron employee, who appears to be well acquainted with the company's accounting and it's (UNINTELLIGIBLE) partnerships. 
"It sure looks to the layman on the street that we are hiding losses in a related company. I am incredibly nervous that we will implode in a wave of accounting scandals. There are probably one or two disgruntled, redeployed employees who know enough about the funny accounting to get us in trouble." 
The letter was written in August, two months before Enron confessed its profits had been inflated. Congressional investigators believe the writer met with Ken Lay for an hour to discuss here concerns and that Enron later told its attorneys not to second-guess the accounting advice of Andersen, the auditor that had approved Enron's books. 
Tonight, Andersen is working damage control, releasing an e-mail about the Enron audit from in-house attorney Nancy Temple, to a partner at the Houston office, saying: 
"Consider reminding the engagement team of our documentation and retention policy." 
Included in that policy, "only final documents will be retained. Graphs and preliminary versions of information will be destroyed currently. Deletion of information from electronic files will be accomplished in such a way that precludes the possibility of subsequent retrieval by Arthur Andersen personnel or third parties." 
Temple has told Andersen she was referring to an audit that was in progress, not previous audits that were later found to be faulty. Staffers at the House Energy and Commerce Committee say Andersen destroyed documents as late as last November, after Enron had restated its financials and the SEC had begun a formal investigation. Documents that should have been held indefinitely, according to accounting experts. 
ALAN ANDERSON, AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF CPAS: Well, if the records were subject to subpoena, and they are destroyed after the subpoena was rendered, that would be more than unusual. That would be illegal. 
CHERNOFF: Andersen Chief Executive, Joseph Beradino, is fighting dearly to save his company's battered reputation. 
JOSEPH BERADINO, ANDERSEN CHIEF EXECUTIVE: Andersen will have to change to restore the public's interest and confidence, and we are working hard to identify the changes we need to make. 
CHERNOFF: Andersen was also the auditor that approved financials at Sunbeam, and Waste Management, companies that paid fines for crooking their books. 
(END VIDEOTAPE) 
CHERNOFF (on camera): Another Big Five accounting firm is in trouble tonight. The Securities and Exchange Commission is censoring KPMG. The firm violated auditor independence rules at a time when it was a major investor in the short-term investments trust. KPMG was also the auditor of the fund, part of the AIM family of mutual funds. The SEC found that KPMG had no procedures in place to avoid such conflicts. Aaron. 
BROWN: Well that's great. Now I got to keep two accounting firms separate. Let's go back to Andersen and Enron for a minute. When you're talking to people out there, no one knows how this is going to play out. But when you're talking to people, do they believe that Andersen, which is a huge company, will survive this? 
CHERNOFF: There are questions being raised about this. We can't right away say that this is going to take the company down. 
BROWN: No, I don't - right, we're not - I just want to know what people are thinking out there. 
CHERNOFF: The entire profession is in serious trouble right now, and they are going to have to do something to improve their image. Clearly Andersen is in the deepest trouble right now. 
BROWN: If I were being even more cynical than I woke up this morning being, I would come away with the feeling that these accounting firms, to get the business that they get, and these are multi-million dollar accounts, will wink and nod if it is in their company, in the company's interest. Is that - am I being unfair here? CHERNOFF: Not in the least. In fact, there is you could argue, an inherent conflict of interest, because you are hired by a certain company to review their books. If they don't like the way you review it, well they can go hire somebody else. There's another scandal here, potentially. You could call it a scandal, in that the accounting firms also have had these auditing practices, and very often, and this was the case right here with Enron, the firm was doing auditing and also doing consulting at the same time. 
BROWN: Allan, thank you. We're all going to get smarter about this before it's over. Up next, this step's a little easier to understand. Small town murder story. We thought twice about doing it until we learned the town hasn't seen a murder in more than 30 years, so we'll take a look at that. And that's nowhere near the only interesting thing about it, as you'll hear when NEWSNIGHT continues on a Monday.

New poll suggests Californians haven't been this gloomy for years
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Not since the mid-'90s have more Californians believed 
the state is headed in the wrong direction. 
And it may get worse. Nearly 60 percent of state residents expect the economy 
to worsen in the next year, while about 40 percent see a brighter horizon, 
according to a new poll. 
The telephone survey of 2,001 adult Californians was done over eight days in 
early May by the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California. The poll 
was conducted in English and Spanish. 
The twin culprits were the souring economy and the electricity crisis. 
"Californians clearly see the electricity crisis as a harbinger of other 
growth-related problems," said Mark Baldassare, the research institute's 
survey director. "This crisis and general economic uncertainty have severely 
undermined public confidence in California's future and in its leaders." 
Change has come swiftly. 
In January, 62 percent of state residents said California was headed in the 
right direction, compared to 48 percent this month. 
Other key findings include: 
82 percent of respondents said population growth over the next 20 years will 
make California a less desirable place to live. 
86 percent of respondents said the electricity crisis will hurt the state's 
economy. 
43 percent of respondents favor building more power plants, up from 32 
percent in January. The second most popular solution, re-regulating the 
electricity industry, was the favored solution in January. 
Traffic congestion, affordable housing, air pollution and a shortage of good 
jobs top the list of negative consequences respondents foresee from the 
state's population growth. 














Grid officials, others studying planned blackouts
By Jennifer Coleman 
Associated Press Writer 
SACRAMENTO (AP) -- Could Californians be waking up to hear a weather report, 
a pollen count and an electricity blackout forecast? 
It's not out of the question, say some lawmakers. 
"I actually think it's a thoughtful plan ... to give folks an opportunity to 
understand the likelihood of blackouts on a daily basis," Assemblyman Fred 
Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, the Assembly's point man on energy. 
Keeley compared it to "weather forecasting, to be able to look at the next 
three or four days, have a percentile about the likelihood of blackouts." 
The Independent System Operator, keeper of the state's power grid, is 
expected to release a report Monday detailing how such a plan would work. 
The idea is "to provide a lot of information so people can make choices to 
live with blackouts on a temporary basis this summer," Keeley said. 
Peter Navarro, a University of California, Irvine, economics professor, 
released a report last month with a consumer group that recommends the state 
set a price limit on what they'll pay for power. And if generators don't 
lower the price, the state should schedule blackouts to cut consumption, he 
said. 
The report by Navarro and the Utility Consumers' Action Network says the 
state's current method of "highly disruptive random rolling blackouts" needs 
to be revamped. 
UCAN suggests that the state be divided into blackout zones that utilities 
could notify ahead of time that power would be cut at a specific time and for 
a certain duration. 
Scheduling blackouts could attract criminals to outage areas, Keeley 
acknowledged, and possibly could subject the state to legal liability for 
traffic accidents or other incidents if power is deliberately shut off. 
"That is a genuine problem and genuine concern," Keeley said. "I think we 
would have to work with local governments so they could have a sufficient 
advance notice to be able to foresee that and try to deploy their resources 
appropriately." 
Critics of the planned blackouts said power producers simply could sell their 
unused electricity to other states, or trim back production to keep supplies 
short. 
Assemblyman Mike Briggs, R-Fresno, plans to introduce a bill this week that 
would have the Public Utilities Commission notify businesses and homeowners 
as much as one month ahead of time when they would have their power cut. 
"We owe the people of this state some kind of schedule," Briggs said. "If 
businesses and individuals knew what days their power could potentially be 
shut off or blacked out, they could plan for that blackout accordingly." 
The Central Valley Republican said the ability to plan for outages would be 
especially benefit farmers, who need power to irrigate their crops. 
Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, who convened a special subcommittee on 
blackouts, has also suggested the state should consider scheduling daily 
blackouts to cut the state's power use and drive down prices. Democratic 
Assembly members plan to introduce their own version of a blackout plan. 
Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Marina del Rey, has said she envisions giving consumers 
three to five days notice that their power will be cut during a particular 
period, so businesses could opt to shut down or shift their operations to 
nonpeak hours such as nights and weekends. 
And by treating blackouts as a first option rather than a last resort, the 
state could cut its peak power needs and drive down prices, Bowen said. 
California power consumers would in essence form "a reverse cartel to stop 
the market manipulation and the price gouging," she said. 
The planned blackout suggestions come as state officials grow increasingly 
concerned that power prices will keep rising this summer, even beyond the 
extraordinary levels the state already has been paying on behalf of three 
cash-strapped privately owned utilities. 
Gov. Gray Davis said the state paid $1,900 per megawatt hour at one point 
last week. 
The state has dedicated $6.7 billion since mid-January to purchase power for 
Pacific Gas and Electric, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and 
Electric. 
Those expenditures will be repaid this summer when the state issues $13.4 
billion in revenue bonds. The bonds will be repaid by ratepayers over 15 
years.

Governor told to try seizure in power war 



By Philip J. LaVelle 
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER 
May 19, 2001 
A major San Diego business group urged Gov. Gray Davis yesterday to take 
emergency steps in the energy crisis, including seizing power plants -- an 
action the governor said may be in the cards. 
Davis met over lunch for nearly two hours with members of the San Diego 
Building Owners and Managers Association, overseers of about 250 commercial 
properties here. 
The meeting, at the University Club at Symphony Towers downtown, was closed 
to the media. 

In remarks to reporters later, Davis repeated his hard line against 
out-of-state energy producers, relating a threat made to a dozen power 
executives in a private meeting May 9.

"I told the generators face to face, as close as I am to you .?.?. 
'Gentlemen, you are going to lose your plants, and I'm going to sign a 
windfall-profits tax, unless you help us get through this summer without 
blackouts and without staggering prices.'?" 
Davis also said he told them: "You know you've been ripping us off, acting in 
a predatory manner. If you do it this summer, you leave me no choice but to 
take your plants and sign a windfall-profits tax. So the ball is in your 
court, gentlemen." 
Building association executive Craig Benedetto said the group had "a frank 
exchange" with Davis. "We want to do our fair share (on conservation), but 
we're also concerned about the supply side," he said. The group "strongly 
urged him to use his emergency powers to do whatever is necessary, including 
seizing plants." 
Association President Cybele Thompson said Davis asked for a string of 
conservation measures. Yet some cannot be implemented without state 
intervention, she said. For example, Davis urged that air-conditioning 
thermostats be set at 78 degrees, but "a lot of our leases don't permit it," 
she said. 
While in San Diego, Davis received an honorary doctor of science degree from 
Scripps Research Institute.





Davis intensifies attacks on Texas firms 



By Ed Mendel 
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER 
May 19, 2001 
SACRAMENTO -- Gov. Gray Davis is stepping up his attacks on Texas energy 
companies, shifting blame in the California electricity crisis to the home 
state of President Bush. 
"We are literally in a war with energy companies who are price-gouging us," 
Davis told reporters while responding to Bush's energy plan this week. "Many 
of those companies are in Texas." 
The governor suggested that most of the power plants that California 
utilities sold under a failed deregulation plan were purchased by energy 
companies in the Southwest. 
Anyone could have purchased the California power plants, Davis said, "but the 
people who bought them just happened to be from the Southwest .?.?. " 
However, a state Energy Commission report shows that when California 
utilities sold more than 20 power plants capable of producing 20,000 
megawatts, Texas firms purchased plants producing about 7,000 megawatts. 
Davis also suggested that the Bush administration is failing to give 
California the same price relief on electricity that Texas has imposed on 
itself. 
"So if Texas can have some kind of price relief," Davis said, "I think 
California is entitled to price relief." 
But the cap that Texas adopted in March prevents energy companies from 
offering to sell power for more than $1,000 per megawatt-hour -- far above 
the $346 average that California expects to pay for non-contracted power this 
spring. 
The campaign operation for Davis, who is up for re-election next year and has 
been mentioned as a potential Bush opponent in 2004, distributed a news 
release yesterday saying that "Davis is emerging as a national spokesman for 
the Democrats on energy issues." 
The governor yesterday appointed two members of former Democratic 
presidential candidate Al Gore's campaign, Mark Fabiani and Chris Lehane, as 
interim communication consultants. He named Gore's former deputy chief of 
staff, Nancy McFadden, as senior adviser. 
The governor will give the Democratic response to Bush's weekly radio address 
today. 
While Davis blames the Lone Star State, none of Pacific Gas and Electric's 
power plants, which produce 7,400 megawatts, was sold to Texas firms. They 
were sold to Duke of North Carolina, Mirant of Georgia, and Calpine of 
California. 
The biggest purchaser of Southern California Edison power plants was AES 
Corp. of Virginia, which obtained 4,706 megawatts. Reliant, a Texas firm, 
bought plants from Edison that can produce 4,000 megawatts. 
Destec of Houston and NRG Energy of Minneapolis purchased two Edison plants 
with an output of 1,583 megawatts. Dynegy of Houston and NRG Energy purchased 
plants producing 1,347 megawatts from San Diego Gas and Electric. 
Davis has said in nationally televised interviews that there is an historic 
transfer of wealth from California to Houston. A large electricity marketing 
firm with close ties to Bush, Enron, also is based in Houston. 
But Davis has focused much of his criticism on Reliant, whose profits soared 
last year. Reliant openly rejected Davis' call last week for generators to 
accept a 30 percent reduction in the debt they are owed by California 
utilities. 
Reliant also was the only generator that appealed a federal court order to 
provide emergency power to California. Davis began singling out Reliant after 
it charged the state $1,900 per megawatt hour for emergency power needed by 
the California grid. 
Reliant's president, Joe Bob Perkins, said in a teleconference with 
California reporters yesterday that Reliant charged the high price because it 
did not want to run a small reserve plant that can only be used for a limited 
number of days. 
The state of California, which has spent about $7 billion buying power for 
utility customers since January, made emergency purchases of 336 megawatt 
hours from Reliant on May 9 and 10, paying $1,900 per megawatt hour for a 
total of $638,400. 
In Texas, the Public Utilities Commission adopted a $1,000 per megawatt hour 
cap on bids to supply emergency power as a "circuit-breaker" in case prices 
somehow skyrocketed after Texas deregulates next year. 
"I realize that amount has been reached in California," said Terry Hadley, a 
spokesman for the Texas PUC. "Nothing close to that has been reached in 
Texas." 
Hadley said the most paid for emergency power by the Texas grid operator was 
$500 per megawatt hour in 1999. He said the average price is $47 to $48 per 
megawatt hour. 
Texas has a surplus of power, unlike California, which has to import about 20 
percent of its power. Texas also has a self-contained power grid that covers 
about 85 percent of the state, including Houston, Dallas, San Antonio, and 
Austin. California is part of a sprawling Western power grid. 
Davis and others have been pushing for wholesale price caps on power in the 
West. The Texas PUC rejected price caps and adopted a high bid cap as a 
fail-safe, saying that would still allow prices to signal whether new power 
plants are needed. 
The governor yesterday also appointed a new energy adviser, Kellan Fluckiger, 
who is on loan from the Independent System Operator, which operates the 
California power grid.






Head of PUC unveils evidence of power plant manipulation 



ASSOCIATED PRESS 
May 19, 2001 
LOS ANGELES ) The head of the California Public Utilities Commission provided 
a state Senate committee with evidence showing three power generators reduced 
electricity production and then benefited from the resulting high prices. 
While testifying before the committee Friday, PUC President Loretta Lynch 
displayed charts that tracked electricity prices and power generation at 
three plants on a single day last November. 
According to the graphs, after the plants reduced production during the 
middle of the day, the state was forced to declare two separate power 
emergencies which indicate electricity reserves had fallen seriously low. 
After the shortfall in supply helped cause a spike in prices, the companies 
operating the three plants suddenly increased their electricity production to 
almost full capacity, allowing them to capitalize on the much higher rates. 
"We certainly see a pattern," Lynch told the committee, which is 
investigating alleged manipulation of the state's wholesale power market by 
energy suppliers. "Many generators are playing on their experience and 
playing, to an extent, California." 
Maintenance records reviewed by investigators show that there were no valid 
reasons for the plants to cut back production, Lynch said. 
She would not identify the power plants involved, however, Lynch did say that 
they are owned by at least two companies. 
Sen. Joseph Dunn, who heads the special committee investigating alleged 
market manipulation, said Lynch's testimony, on its face, is "very damning." 
He said his committee has uncovered additional preliminary evidence showing 
that several power companies have allegedly engaged in similar behavior. 
During a break in Friday's hearing, a spokeswoman for a trade group of major 
power suppliers told the Los Angeles Times that there have been no 
coordinated efforts to shrink supplies to increase profits. 
"There has been no collusion," said Jean Muoz of the Independent Energy 
Producers Association. 
The PUC and state Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer are jointly investigating the 
exorbitant wholesale power prices that have cost California billions and 
brought major utilities to financial ruin





California economy braces for $5.7 billion electric rate hike 



By Michael Liedtke
ASSOCIATED PRESS 
May 19, 2001 
SAN FRANCISCO ) Higher power costs zapped restauranteur Marino Sandoval and 
his customers even before California regulators decided this week how to 
allocate a $5.7 billion electricity rate hike ) the highest in the state's 
history. 
Faced with soaring natural gas rates that tripled his utility bill, Sandoval 
last month raised the prices at his popular Mexican restaurant chain, El 
Balazo, by as much as 20 percent on some items. A giant burrito that cost 
$4.95 at the end of March costs $5.95 Saturday. 
"We had to do it because it seemed like the price of everything, from our 
beans to our tortillas, was going up almost every day. Our higher prices have 
everything to do with the higher energy prices," said Sandoval, who runs six 
restaurants in San Francisco and the East Bay. 
From hotels to bagel shops, businesses throughout California have been 
raising their prices or imposing special surcharges to offset rising power 
costs. Most of the increases so far have reflected higher natural gas costs, 
which utilities have been passing along to their customers throughout the 
state's power crisis. 
Now, businesses and households are bracing for electricity rate increases 
that could balloon the bills of the largest users of the state's two biggest 
utilities, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison Co. 
The higher rates, which will begin appearing in June's utility bills, 
threaten to jolt the state's already jittery economy. 
"Pretty soon, we may see California staring down the barrel of a recession," 
said Dave Puglia, a vice president for APCO, a public affairs firm hired by 
California business interests to study the economic effect of the state's 
energy woes. 
Until now, California businesses have only had to pay a fraction of the 
state's staggering electricity bill, which is on a pace to reach $70 billion 
this year ) about 10 times more than in 1999. 
By itself, the $5.7 billion rate increase approved by the California Public 
Utilities Commission probably isn't enough to topple the state's roughly $1 
trillion economy ) the sixth largest in the world. 
"It will cause some hardships, particularly for some small business owners, 
but from the macro point of view, these rate increases aren't going to have a 
major impact on California's output," predicted Sung Won Sohn, chief 
economist for Wells Fargo & Co., which runs the biggest bank headquartered in 
the state. 
But some business leaders are worried the hike will represent the coup de 
grace for many companies already reeling from rising expenses for gasoline, 
natural gas, health care benefits and workers' compensation insurance. 
Against this backdrop, many employers also face pressure to raise their 
workers' wages to help pay for California's high housing costs. 
"If this keeps up, at some point, we are going to reach a breaking point in 
the economy," said Allan Zaremberg, president of the California Chamber of 
Commerce. 
The California Chamber is part of the California Alliance for Energy and 
Economic Stability, a coalition that sought to shift more of the electricity 
rate increase from businesses to households. 
Under the plan approved by the PUC, businesses are expected to pay about $4.6 
billion more for electricity and households will pay an additional $1.1 
billion. 
Even if they are spared on their utility bills, consumers still will be 
pinched by higher prices for goods and services as businesses pass along 
their electricity price increases. 
Some California firms, particularly those making commodities sold around the 
world, won't be able to substantially raise their prices without losing 
business from customers who will buy from competitors in other states and 
countries. 
Manufacturers of cement, glass, paper products and steel are among the 
companies that probably won't be able to pass along their higher energy 
costs, Puglia said. 
The rate increases mean that utility bills will consume about 25 percent to 
30 percent of a big manufacturer's budget, Puglia estimated, up from about 15 
percent now. 
"I wouldn't be surprised if we see some companies go out of business because 
of this," said Justin Bradley, director of energy programs for the Silicon 
Valley Manufacturing Association, a high-tech trade group. 
Even if they don't shut down completely, many companies likely will lay off 
workers as they cut costs to pay for power. The California Manufacturers and 
Technology Association estimates that the energy crisis will result in the 
loss of 135,755 jobs ) or about 40,000 more than the entire dot-com industry 
has laid off nationwide during the past 16 months. 
Painful though they may be, higher electricity rates and some resulting 
layoffs are a better alternative than the increased number of blackouts that 
probably would have occurred if retail prices hadn't been raised, according 
to most economists. 
"People are wildly exaggerating how much this is going to hurt the California 
economy," said Stephen Levy, director of the Center for Continuing Study of 
the California Economy, a Palo Alto research firm. "The rate increases are 
part of a long-term solution for California. We needed them to stabilize the 
market. On balance, this is a good thing." 
Even though his monthly utility bill at one of his restaurants rose from 
$1,500 last year to $4,500 this year, El Balazo's Sandoval shares Levy's 
optimism. After all, customers continue to pour into his restaurants, despite 
his restaurant's higher menu prices. 
"Business is so good that I have been too busy to think about whether I am 
going to have to raise my prices again," he said. "If I have to, I will. I 
don't think people are going to stop eating because of this."





Price information sought from natural gas companies 



By H. Josef Hebert
ASSOCIATED PRESS 
May 19, 2001 
WASHINGTON ) A federal regulatory agency late Friday directed natural gas 
companies selling in California to provide detailed information for better 
investigations of possible price gouging and market abuses. 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said it viewed the unusually high 
prices of wholesale natural gas in California as "a matter of serious 
concern" but didn't have enough information to determine if they are illegal. 
It noted that the spot price of natural gas charged at the California border 
has been exceedingly high since December when it ranged between $11.79 and 
$18.80 per thousand cubic feet, compared to $4 to $7 elsewhere in the county. 
The most recent prices at the California border exceed $9, more than twice 
the wholesale price in other parts of the country. Such a disparity over such 
a long period of time would not be expected in a competitive market, the 
agency said. 
California officials have argued for months that FERC should intervene and 
more aggressively investigate high natural gas prices, which have been a 
major cause of some of the run-up in electricity costs in the state. Many of 
the state's power plants run on natural gas. 
The order asks for a wide range of information at the end of each calendar 
quarter including volumes of gas sold, prices, transportation rates, daily 
operational pipeline capacity and volumes flowing in and out of the state. 
Allegations of price gouging and market manipulation have been at the center 
of a hearing by a FERC administrative law judge all this week. The hearing 
will continue next week. 
The case involves a major natural gas pipeline owned by the Houston-based El 
Paso Corp., which supplies Southern California. 
California regulators, and two of the states financially troubled utilities, 
filed a formal complaint with FERC, alleging that manipulation by two El Paso 
subsidiaries ) one a gas marketer and the other an operator of the pipeline ) 
led to $3.7 billion in natural gas overcharges since March 2000. 
El Paso Corp. has strongly denied the allegation. 
For the past week, attorneys for El Paso have questioned witnesses from the 
California Public Utilities Commission in an attempt to disprove the charges. 
The witnesses admitted they failed to consider some additional factors that 
could have affected prices in their analyses, but they did not back away from 
their conclusion. 
In support of their argument, California officials have provided internal El 
Paso memos ) which have not been disclosed publicly ) that allegedly discuss 
market control in connection with gas flowing through the pipeline. 
Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner has said the documents contain 
statements "that could lead one to believe there was an abuse" of pipeline 
capacity. He is not expected to make a ruling on the case until later this 
summer. A final decision on what action to take, if any, would be up to the 
full commission. 






Davis Sharpens Attack on Bush Energy Plan 
Power: He also hires high-profile consultants in effort to boost his 
political standing. 

By DAN MORAIN and MARK Z. BARABAK, Times Staff Writers


?????SACRAMENTO--Gov. Gray Davis is going on the attack as the Democratic 
Party's point man against President Bush's energy plan, even as he seeks to 
bolster his drooping standing in California by hiring consultants who honed 
their crisis-management skills during the scandal-ridden Clinton 
administration.
?????Davis was expected to again criticize Bush's energy plan today as he 
makes the official Democratic response to Bush's weekly radio address.
?????In the last week, Davis has variously blasted the president's energy 
plan and Texas energy companies on an ABC talk show, on CNN, and in an 
opinion piece for the Washington Post. In an interview with Associated Press, 
Davis vowed to "hold everyone accountable: myself, the energy producers and 
the president of the United States."
?????"We are literally in a war with energy companies who are price gouging 
us," Davis said Friday. "Many of those companies are in Texas. Mr. President, 
you didn't create this problem, but you are the only one who can solve it."
?????At the same time, Davis all but acknowledged his own political problems 
when he announced that he has retained two political aides, Mark Fabiani and 
Chris Lehane. The two, who also do work for Southern California Edison, will 
be paid by taxpayers at a combined rate of $30,000 per month--more than the 
$13,750 earned by the governor himself.
?????Lehane, known for his tart-tongued commentary, was Vice President Al 
Gore's main campaign spokesman, and had a knack for getting under Bush's skin 
during the 2000 campaign.
?????Fabiani, a Harvard law school graduate, became a highly partisan and 
acerbic White House defender when President Clinton was mired in 
investigations ranging from the Whitewater land deal to the Monica Lewinsky 
affair. Fabiani developed his reputation for being able to handle crises 
while defending Mayor Tom Bradley against various investigations near the end 
of the late mayor's tenure.
?????In political circles, the nickname of their firm is Masters of Disaster.
?????Davis' decision to retain Lehane and Fabiani comes as the governor's 
once-sterling poll numbers have fallen sharply and he faces persistent 
criticism over his handling of the energy crisis.
?????Their arrival also corresponds to Davis' increasingly aggressive stand 
on the energy crisis. In recent days, Davis for the first time has attacked 
an individual generator, Reliant Energy of Houston, for charging a record 
$1,900 per megawatt for electricity on two days last week. He also dared 
President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney to "stand up" to their 
"friends" in the energy business by capping wholesale electricity prices 
charged in California.
?????Davis' more assertive stance comes as Democrats nationwide step up their 
attacks on the president, using the energy plan to launch a broader assault 
on Bush's leadership and policies.
?????"One of the glaring flaws in the Bush energy plan is that it offers no 
short-term relief for consumers," said Dan Pfeiffer, a spokesman for the 
Democratic Governors Assn., which Davis chairs. "And there is no better 
example of that than the fact he does nothing to control runaway prices in 
California."
?????In addition to portraying Bush as ignoring the plight of California--the 
nation's largest electoral prize--Democrats see Bush's energy response as a 
way of confirming their broader assertion that he is captive to oil interests.
?????"This is a way for us to show how they are really an administration and 
a party that is bought and paid for by special interests," said Jenny Backus, 
a spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee.
?????To press the case, the party has created a snide Web 
site--www.grandoldpetroleum--and will soon start running TV ads attacking GOP 
lawmakers over the energy issue, including in California.
?????Paul Maslin, the governor's pollster, said Davis had given the president 
a grace period after he took office in January to see how Bush would address 
the energy problem. But the governor grew increasingly frustrated when it 
became clear "we weren't going to get any help from Washington."
?????For his part, Bush made glancing reference to California in a speech 
Friday at a hydroelectric plant in Pennsylvania, part of his tour to sell the 
administration's energy blueprint. The president praised Californians for 
doing "a fantastic job in conservation."
?????"And yet they're lacking energy. They're having blackouts," Bush said. 
"We all must be deeply concerned about our fellow citizens in the great state 
of California. But the problems in California show that you cannot conserve 
your way to energy independence."
?????While Bush did not mention the governor, the president's deputies have 
rushed to criticize him.
?????Virginia Gov. James Gilmore, head of the Republican National Committee, 
suggested Davis was hypocritical to attack Bush when "the president is the 
one who came forward with the first energy plan we've seen in years."
?????"He's going to have to answer the question of what he's done as 
governor," Gilmore said. "While he's in the process of attacking, one might 
suspect he may be diverting attention away from his own record."
?????On Thursday, Environmental Protection Agency administrator Christine 
Todd Whitman was overheard criticizing Davis to Iowa Republican Party 
official Darrell Kearney.
?????"He's had plenty of time to do something, and he hasn't done anything," 
she said as she left a meeting room in Nevada, Iowa, where Bush had just 
finished speaking.
?????Some more independent observers see political liabilities in the Bush 
plan, namely the focus on long-term solutions at a time voters are growing 
increasingly upset about high gas prices and soaring utility bills.
?????"While [the administration] talks about how we approach things in the 
next five years, there's not a lot of empathy or understanding for what's 
affecting people now," said Stuart Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political 
analyst in Washington.
?????"Maybe it's unfair to talk about Bush and Cheney's oil backgrounds and 
Texas backgrounds," Rothenberg said. "But it's an obvious thing for critics 
to do."
?????Rothenberg predicted a backlash that could cost Republicans control of 
Congress next year, "if the energy issue continues to grow and Americans 
really become concerned. . . . It puts the burden on the White House and 
Republicans to change that."
?????Davis' new aides, while considered expert in solving the kind of 
political crisis threatening Davis, pose the potential of controversy on 
their own.
?????As consultants, Lehane and Fabiani, unlike government officials, are not 
required to file conflict of interest statements detailing their holdings and 
sources of income.
?????However, in an interview on Friday, Lehane acknowledged that he and 
Fabiani have worked for about two months as consultants for Southern 
California Edison. He insisted there is no conflict.
?????Davis is struggling to win legislative approval of a deal he struck with 
Edison to rescue the utility from bankruptcy. Several lawmakers oppose the 
deal, contending that it is too rich for Edison.
?????"Both sides [Edison and Davis] are in agreement on what needs to be done 
here," Lehane said. "As the governor said . . . we are literally in a war 
with these out-of-state generators."
?????Although Lehane and Fabiani will be working on broader communications 
issues for Davis, Harry Snyder of Consumers Union, a critic of the 
Davis-Edison deal, blasted Davis' decision to hire consultants who also work 
for the utility.
?????"Davis has done everything politically wrong," Snyder said. "He hasn't 
done anything that is consistent with the democratic process. It is the worst 
abuse of power that I have seen in 25 years of lobbying."
?????Others suggested that Davis was helping himself by bringing the duo 
aboard.
?????"Mark is the premier crisis manager in the country in terms of 
communication strategy," Democratic political consultant Bill Carrick said. 
"He has tremendous experience. . . . He takes the incoming. You get hit with 
something in the morning. He knows how to turn it around by the afternoon."
?????Lehane said the governor's decision to hire them does not suggest Davis 
will become more pugnacious, although he added that Davis is "not someone 
afraid to pick a fight when someone, like the out-of-state generators, 
represent policies that are bad for the people of California."
?????"Gov. Davis has been very successful in politics for quite some time in 
this state," Lehane said. "He has a keen understanding of how this state 
works and how politics in this state works. I don't think his style is going 
to change or be any different than he has been throughout his career."

PUC Allegations Detailed 
Hearing: The commission president tells a Senate panel that maintenance 
records show no valid reason for generators to cut power production. 

By ROBERT J. LOPEZ and RICH CONNELL, Times Staff Writers


?????The head of the California Public Utilities Commission Friday provided 
fresh details showing that power generators scaled back electricity 
production and then benefited from the resulting high prices.
?????In sworn testimony before a state Senate committee, PUC President 
Loretta Lynch said the companies' behavior helped drain so much electricity 
from the state's grid that officials were forced to declare emergency alerts.
?????Lynch's testimony followed her comments Thursday to The Times that state 
investigators have found evidence of power plants being shut down 
unnecessarily to create "artificial shortages," often when the state was most 
desperate for electricity.
?????During her testimony Friday, Lynch went beyond her assertions about 
unnecessary plant shutdowns and accused generators of also needlessly 
throttling back generation.
?????The PUC and state Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer are jointly investigating the 
exorbitant wholesale power prices that have cost California billions and 
brought major utilities to financial ruin.
?????Generators have said they never engaged in any conduct intended to 
manipulate wholesale electricity prices, including unnecessarily shutting 
down their plants or reducing supply. The facilities, theysay, are aging and 
have run so hard during the state's crisis that they often require extensive 
maintenance.
?????But the details released by Friday by Lynch added to the questions 
surrounding the generators' activities.
?????Lynch displayed charts that track electricity prices and power 
generation at three plants on a single day last November. After the plants 
reduced production during the middle of the day, the graphs show, the state 
was forced to declare two separate power emergencies because electricity 
reserves had fallen seriously low.
?????The shortfall in supply helped cause a spike in prices. With that, the 
companies operating the three plants suddenly increased their electricity 
production to almost full capacity, allowing them to capitalize on the much 
higher rates.
?????"We certainly see a pattern," Lynch told the committee, which 
isinvestigating alleged manipulation of the state's wholesale power market by 
energy suppliers. "Many generators are playing on their experience and 
playing, to an extent, California."
?????Maintenance records reviewed by investigators show that there were no 
valid reasons for the plants to cut back production, Lynch said. She declined 
to identify the power plants involved, saying only that they are owned by at 
least two companies.
?????Sen. Joseph Dunn (D-Santa Ana), who heads the special committee 
investigating alleged market manipulation, said Lynch's information, on its 
face, is "very damning."
?????He said his committee has uncovered additional preliminary evidence 
showing that several power companies have allegedly engaged in similar 
behavior.
?????"We are looking at data that is suspicious," Dunn said.
?????During a break in Friday's hearing, a spokeswoman for a trade group of 
major power suppliers said there have been no coordinated efforts to shrink 
supplies to increase profits.
?????"There has been no collusion," said Jean Muoz of the Independent Energy 
Producers Assn.
?????She said many of the plants bought by out-of-state generators under 
California's flawed deregulation plan are more than 30 years old. The plants 
have been running at high levels to help the state with its energy crunch, 
she said.
?????Muoz told reporters that the plants owned by out-of-state companies 
last year produced 60% more electricity than the previous year.
?????Although no firm has been singled out by the PUC or the attorney 
general's office, Atlanta-based Mirant Corp. said inspectors have visited 
company plants more than 100 times this year and have found no wrongdoing. 
"Mirant has run its plants voluntarily and continually throughout the 
crisis," the company said in a statement Friday.
?????But Lynch said Friday that visits to more than 80 plants by PUC 
investigators since December show that generators are not always producing 
all the power they can.
?????"It appears that there have been numerous instances within the past 
half-year where generation units were not producing the amount of electricity 
that they were capable of producing," Lynch said.

Utility Exec Rejects the Governor's Criticism 
Power: Leader of Reliant Energy defends policies and says Davis' rhetoric 
could harm California. 

By NANCY VOGEL, Times Staff Writer


?????SACRAMENTO--The top executive of a Houston-based energy company singled 
out for criticism this week by Gov. Gray Davis defended his company Friday 
and warned that the governor's rhetoric will ultimately hurt California.
?????"On Wednesday we were called obstructionist," said Joe Bob Perkins, 
chief executive of Reliant Energy, which bought five Southern California 
power plants when the state launched deregulation in 1998.
?????"I don't think it's obstructionist to supply record amounts of power 
from old plants in order to keep the lights on," Perkins said. "I don't think 
it's obstructionist to invest more than $80 million in 2000 alone to upgrade 
the plants and reduce emission levels. I don't think it's obstructionist to 
continue to run our facilities at times when there's been no guarantee of 
payment."
?????In a telephone conference call with reporters, Perkins said, "California 
officials must lessen the rhetoric and focus on efforts to mitigate the 
impacts of summer blackouts."
?????Perkins said threats of windfall profits taxes and plant seizures could 
scare off substantial business from California.
?????For months, Davis has disparaged private power plant owners in 
California as gougers and profiteers, but until last week he did not single 
out individual companies.
?????Last Thursday, after state power buyers paid an extraordinary $1,900 per 
megawatt-hour, Davis broke the confidentiality he had maintained on state 
power purchases and named Reliant as the seller.
?????Reliant has sued to get out of its obligation to sell power to the state 
and refused to discuss forgiving some portion of the $307 million it is owed 
by California utilities.
?????"They're one of only a couple of generators that say absolutely no way, 
no how are they going to negotiate for anything less than 100%," Davis 
spokesman Steve Maviglio said after the Reliant executive's remarks.
?????The governor's recent attack has made some Reliant officials wonder if 
he is building a case to seize control of its power plants. Davis has 
threatened to commandeer plants to bring down wholesale power costs.
?????Perkins said his company set a high price last week to discourage the 
state from buying the power, which was produced at a small, inefficient plant 
near Santa Barbara that cannot run more than nine days a year because of air 
pollution regulations.
?????Reliant officials said they wanted to reserve the plant for use later 
this summer.
?????Maviglio said Reliant's argument "defies logic."
?????"When you make a bid . . . you want somebody to buy the power."

PUC Chief Alleges Price Collusion 
Power: She cites evidence that plants were shut down to create "artificial 
shortages." An industry spokesman calls the accusation "idiocy." 

By RICH CONNELL and ROBERT LOPEZ, Times Staff Writers 

?????State investigators have uncovered evidence that a "cartel" of power 
companies shut down plants for unnecessary maintenance to ratchet up prices, 
the head of the California Public Utilities Commission asserted Thursday.
?????PUC President Loretta Lynch said her agency, working with the state 
attorney general's office, is probing patterns of plant outages that have 
created "artificial shortages," particularly when the state has issued 
emergency alerts because of seriously low levels of electricity.
?????"There are instances where plants could have produced, and they chose 
not to," Lynch said in an interview at The Times.
?????"And it is clear that there are instances that plants, when called to 
produce, chose not to produce," even when they were obligated to do so under 
special contracts with the state and utility companies.
?????Lynch said the ongoing investigation has already produced enough 
information for the PUC and attorney general's office to take legal action 
against the generators next month. The exact nature of that action, she said, 
is still under review.
?????Lynch, who is an attorney, did not name specific suppliers or provide 
documentation of her assertions. She said that information will remain 
confidential until court proceedings are undertaken.
?????Generators have long denied any attempt at manipulating the power market 
in any unlawful way, including orchestrating plant shutdowns. They say the 
facilities are so old and have been run so hard during the power crisis that 
breakdowns are a recurring problem.
?????Lynch and Gov. Gray Davis, who has been particularly critical of 
out-of-state generators, have not suggested that every plant shutdown has 
been unwarranted.
?????In fact, the governor's top advisor on power plants released a statement 
last week saying inspectors determined that a Bay Area plant shutdown was 
justified and that the company's officials were "accommodating."
?????State Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer was not available for comment on his joint 
investigation with the PUC. A spokesman would only confirm that Lockyer's 
office is investigating plant shutdowns as part of a wide-ranging probe of 
possible civil and criminal violations.
?????So far, the attorney general's office has subpoenaed documents in 91 
categories from generators, including records of plant operations, pricing 
practices and information the merchants may have shared with one another 
about California's power market.
?????"We're looking for behavior that would violate antitrust or unfair 
business practice laws," Lockyer has told The Times.
?????Although he has not provided details of his office's findings, he 
recently said the inquiry is "beginning to get interesting."
?????Lynch said evidence of allegedly unnecessary plant shutdowns was amassed 
during interviews by investigators and in a review of the voluminous 
subpoenaed records, obtained after intense legal battles with the power 
companies.
?????In addition, investigators have been entering plants where unplanned 
shutdowns have occurred to examine operations and maintenance records, Lynch 
said. At times, the investigators have been denied access and have had to 
exert legal pressure to get in, she said. 
?????The plant shutdowns are a key factor in the soaring power prices, which 
have gone from $200 a megawatt-hour in December to as high as $1,900 last 
week.
?????"I would argue it's no accident," Lynch said of the high prices. "That 
in fact it's [due to] the coordinated behavior of a cartel."
?????The power generators have repeatedly said they have acted within the 
rules of California's flawed deregulation program, which allowed them to buy 
power plants formerly run by the state's three largest utilities.
?????Gary Ackerman, a spokesman for a trade association of large power 
producers, said Lynch's allegations were "the height of idiocy."
?????The reason many plants have been down in recent months, he said, is that 
power producers must perform maintenance now in anticipation of heavy summer 
demand.
?????He said he doubted that state investigators could prove wrongdoing 
because there was no conspiracy to turn off supplies.
?????"My members do not make money by shutting down their plants so their 
competitors can make money," said Ackerman, executive director of the Western 
Power Trading Forum.
?????State analysts have argued, however, that power traders can reap 
extraordinary profits by withholding power because the prices for the power 
that is sold are so high.
?????According to Lynch, investigators have found that some companies were 
more aggressive than others in allegedly using plant shutdowns to manipulate 
the state's power market.
?????She said investigators have also found a suspicious pattern: When 
operators of the state electricity grid declare a Stage 1 alert--meaning that 
electricity reserves have dropped below 7%--plants that do not need repairs 
suddenly are yanked offline. That, she said, aggravates the shortages, and 
the cost of wholesale electricity soars.
?????Before December, state analysts alleged that power traders had driven up 
prices primarily through bidding. At the time, the market was designed to pay 
all power suppliers the highest amount accepted by the state's grid operator.
?????That changed in December, when new federal regulations restructured 
California's wholesale power market to loosen price controls, Lynch said. 
Since then, a new pattern of plant shutdowns has emerged--"not coincidentally 
in my view," she said. Now, she added, the state has endured "historically 
high levels of unplanned plant outages."
?????The investigation is not focusing on power plants still operated by 
utility companies because they have not been "going off [line] at record 
levels," Lynch said.
?????The California Energy Commission reported last week that the state's 
electrical grid has been sorely tested by plant shutdowns at a rate several 
times higher than in the last two years.
?????A Times analysis of state data found that, throughout the last two 
months, about 12,000 megawatts of production was offline, more than a third 
of the peak power used in California on a typical day. That has been about 
evenly divided between scheduled and sudden plant shutdowns.
?????By contrast, shutdowns in the same period of 1999 and 2000 took only 
3,300 to 5,700 megawatts offline.
?????Last month, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ordered electricity 
supplier Williams Energy Marketing and Trading to pay $8 million in 
connection with allegations that plants were improperly shut down to raise 
prices. The company agreed to settle the case without admitting any 
wrongdoing.
?????However, FERC released a study in February of closures at three other 
California plants that it concluded were not undertaken to create a scarcity 
of power.
?????After talking to plant operators by telephone, reviewing documents and 
visiting the three plants, federal inspectors concluded that "the companies 
appeared to have taken whatever steps were necessary to bring the generating 
facilities back online as soon as possible by accelerating maintenance and 
incurring additional expenses."

Critics Say Bush Proposal Leaves California in the Dark 
Effect: President's energy plan may not even offer a silver lining for the 
power-deprived Golden State. 

By JENIFER WARREN and ROBIN FIELDS, Times Staff Writers 

?????California lawmakers, analysts and others waist-deep in the state's 
power crisis reached a single conclusion Thursday about the White House 
energy plan:
?????By the time many of President Bush's proposals kick in, it will be too 
late to do the Golden State much good.
?????"This plan does absolutely nothing to help California get through the 
next critical 18 months," groused state Sen. Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey). 
"You can't focus just on the long term here. Because the patient will be dead 
before we get the life-support systems in place."
?????Gov. Gray Davis and others say the single best step Bush could take to 
help the state is to impose controls on runaway electricity prices that are 
draining California's treasury and forcing massive utility rate increases.
?????Instead, the president has offered an energy blueprint anchored by an 
expansion in drilling for natural gas and oil, increased reliance on nuclear 
power and more than $10 billion in tax credits for conservation and energy 
development.
?????Most of Bush's proposals, however, are slow-acting remedies, and many 
others already are being applied in California, which was hit by energy woes 
far ahead of other states.
?????The plan's dozens of incentive programs designed to boost output or 
promote conservation cannot be ramped up in time to protect the state from 
blackouts and painful spikes in electricity prices, experts say.
?????"Overall, the message in this plan is, 'Drop dead, California,' " said 
Eric Heitz of the Energy Foundation, a San Francisco-based research and 
advocacy group.
?????"I don't think it delivers another megawatt to California," added 
Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission.
?????State economic analysts say the plan fails California by viewing the 
power crisis as an ongoing emergency, rather than a temporary one. 
California's supply crunch should ease dramatically by summer 2003, once 27 
new power plants--15 of them licensed, 12 in the pipeline--start churning.
?????"It's not that we don't have long-term problems," said Stephen Levy, 
director of the Palo Alto-based Center for Continuing Study of the California 
Economy. "It's just that energy isn't among them."
?????Others, including many environmentalists, say Bush could have made a 
noticeable impact by, for example, beefing up energy efficiency programs--a 
quick, clean and relatively inexpensive way to cut demand.
?????"Why not provide aggressive incentives [rebates] to get people to 
purchase more efficient air conditioners?" asked Dan Reicher, assistant 
Energy secretary in the Clinton administration. "Over the course of the year, 
a program like that can make a dramatic difference" because air conditioning 
consumes nearly one-third of California's peak energy supply.
?????Instead, Reicher noted, Bush earlier this year rolled back efficiency 
standards for air conditioners, a move that critics say will require the 
country to build 43 new power plants.
?????Even the few elements of the plan that looked promising for California 
were clouded by doubt.
?????Bush, for example, directed the Energy secretary to explore ways to 
relieve a key transmission bottleneck, known as "Path 15," between Northern 
and Southern California. But he specified that the upgrade, which requires 
building a 90-mile line at an estimated cost of $225 million, be funded by 
"nonfederal contributions"--meaning the financially strapped utilities might 
be expected to bear the cost.
?????Gov. Davis, who lately has stepped up his pleas for help from 
Washington, said the Bush plan offers too little too late for California and 
criticized the president for allowing "the price-gouging energy companies, 
many of which reside in Texas, to get away with murder."
?????Davis said the state is "doing everything possible to build and conserve 
our way out of the problem," but it desperately needs federal price controls 
on energy costs. In 1999, California energy users spent about $7 billion; 
this year, even with consumption down 5%, the bill could top $50 billion.
?????But Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney, who led the task force that 
prepared the plan, are opposed to price caps, preferring to let market forces 
reign.
?????Davis said that laissez faire approach puts California's economy in 
peril.
?????"Just saying, over the long haul, everything will work out is turning a 
blind eye to the bleeding and hemorrhaging that exist in this state," Davis 
said. "Small businesses . . . literally will go out of business because they 
can't afford these rates."
?????Analysts who studied the Bush plan say they are particularly 
disappointed because it covers a lot of ground already plowed by California.
?????Bush recommends building 1,900 power plants over the next 20 
years--about eight plants a month. But California is already on a 
plant-building spree that will give it a comfortable supply within two years.
?????The president also wants to streamline approval of plants and is pushing 
for a renewed commitment to nuclear power. The California governor, however, 
has already ordered expedited licensing of new plants under an executive 
order issued in February.
?????There is little evidence, meanwhile, that Californians are eager to 
approve an expansion in nuclear power. Nationwide, not one new nuclear plant 
has been licensed in more than 20 years. And a Times Poll in February found 
that 60% of Californians oppose more nuclear reactors in the state.
?????"You can barely build clean-burning gas plants here, let alone nuclear 
plants," said Edward Kahn, a San Francisco-based energy consultant with 
Analysis Group/Economics.
?????Among other elements of the plan that could affect California is a 
proposal to allow federal authorities to take private land for power lines. 
Currently, the U.S. government's power to forcibly acquire private property 
applies only to highways and gas pipelines. Expanding that power is likely to 
enrage property owners and property-rights advocates, who typically expect 
backing from Bush-style conservatives.
?????"I'm just surprised that this administration would want to preempt the 
state's [authority] over its own land," said Lynch of the PUC.
?????The issue is already heated in California. Communities in southwestern 
Riverside County have mobilized to resist San Diego Gas & Electric's attempts 
to use eminent domain to obtain private land for 31 miles of transmission 
lines. The Legislature is considering a bill that would require state energy 
officials and utilities to grab public land first before reaching for private 
acreage.
?????Bush also proposed a unified, private national electricity grid, an idea 
that seems at odds with Southern California Edison's effort to sell its 
transmission lines to the state. But Edison officials said they hope to have 
their deal worked out long before the president's idea comes to fruition--if 
it ever does.
?????Unveiling his energy program in St. Paul, Minn., Bush said he is "deeply 
concerned about the impact of blackouts on the daily lives of the good people 
of the state of California."
?????But S. Davis Freeman, the former Los Angeles Department of Water and 
Power chief who is now the governor's energy advisor, said Bush has let down 
the state by failing to "answer the 911 call."
?????"It's like your house is on fire," Freeman said. "You call the fire 
department, and they say, 'No, we're not coming, but we're building a 
super-duper firetruck that will be ready five years from now.' "

Wall St. Cautious Over Energy Sector's Outlook for Next Year 
Stocks: Earnings for many oil and natural gas producers are expected to top 
out in 2001 as prices stabilize. 

By JOSH FRIEDMAN and TOM PETRUNO, Times Staff Writers 

?????President Bush's energy plan, unveiled Thursday, helped spark a broad 
rally across the energy sector and among firms that stand to benefit by 
selling equipment and services to oil and natural gas companies.
?????Yet Wall Street has been taking a cautious stance toward energy shares 
in recent months, and Thursday's rally doesn't change much, some analysts and 
money managers say.
?????Despite the long-term earnings boost the sector could get under Bush's 
plan, many oil and gas companies are expected to post lower earnings in 2002 
than in 2001, analysts estimate.
?????That reflects expectations that crude oil and natural gas prices will at 
best stabilize at current levels--which are down sharply from their 2000 
peaks--or head lower.
?????Thus, after heady gains in 1999 and 2000 as oil and gas prices rocketed, 
many energy stocks have stalled this year.
?????The American Stock Exchange index of 15 major natural-gas-related 
stocks, for example, is down 4% year to date. The Standard & Poor's index of 
six large oil and gas exploration and production companies has lost 5.3%.
?????Schlumberger (ticker symbol: SLB), a leading oil-field services company, 
has seen its shares pull back 15% since Jan. 1, even with a gain of $1.78 to 
$67.99 on Thursday.
?????By contrast, the blue-chip S&P 500 index is down 2.4% this year.
?????Craig T. Callahan, manager of Icon Energy stock mutual fund and chief 
investment officer at the Icon Funds group, said investors need to be choosy 
to find good buys today in the energy sector.
?????"We're leaning more toward the refiners than the drillers because 
they're the better bargains," he said. "And at this point the good news looks 
fully priced into the services and equipment group."
?????After betting big on the energy sector in early-1999, Callahan took 
profits earlier this year. "We just don't see energy as a leader anymore--its 
leadership days are done," he said.
?????Callahan shrugged off any potential windfalls from Bush's proposal. "We 
look at these companies from the bottom up and pretty much ignore the macro 
trends," he said.
?????For the near term, investors have to cope with the prospect that 
earnings at many energy companies will decline in 2002.
?????Chevron (CHV), for example, is expected to earn $7.20 a share this year, 
according to analysts' consensus estimate as tracked by IBES/Thomson 
Financial. But next year the company's earnings are expected to fall to $6.20.
?????At the stock's current price--it rose 41 cents to $95.66 Thursday--the 
price-to-earnings ratio based on estimated 2002 results is 15. That is lower 
than the average blue-chip stock P/E of 21, but experts note that energy 
stocks generally have lower P/Es because of the inherently cyclical nature of 
the business.
?????Still, some analysts believe the Bush energy plan could revive interest 
in many energy shares, if investors take a longer-term view.
?????Companies that explore for, produce and refine oil and gas could be 
among the biggest beneficiaries of Bush's initiatives, said Corey McElveen, 
stock analyst at Morningstar Inc. In particular, he cites Phillips Petroleum 
(P) and Exxon Mobil (XOM), which already have operations in energy-rich 
Alaska. Phillips rose $1.72 to $65.87 on Thursday, while Exxon Mobil eased 77 
cents to $88.73.
?????Callahan, however, favors companies that focus on refining. Ashland 
(ASH), Pennzoil-Quaker State (PZL) and Sunoco (SUN) are among the refining 
stocks with reasonable valuations and plenty of upside, he said.
?????Ashland eased 17 cents to $43.50 Thursday, Pennzoil-Quaker added 5 cents 
to $15.96 and Sunoco rose 98 cents to $41.45.
?????Some money managers prefer to leave the traditional oil and gas stocks 
for others--in favor of alternative energy issues.
?????John Hammerschmidt, manager of Turner New Energy & Power Technology 
Fund, likes the potential of companies such as Energy Conversion (ENER), 
which is seeking to develop cheaper and sturdier solar panels, and AstroPower 
(APWR), another solar firm.
?????Energy Conversion jumped $3.53 to $31.28 on Thursday while AstroPower 
leaped $3.38 to $54.93.
?????In the fuel cell industry, Hammerschmidt pointed to Ballard Power 
Systems (BLDP), whose products are being used in clean-running buses in Los 
Angeles and elsewhere, and FuelCell Energy (FCEL). A tax credit for fuel-cell 
vehicles, as proposed by Bush, "could be huge" for such firms, he said.
?????Ballard jumped $8.37 to $57.60 and FuelCell rose $4.98 to $85.28.
?????But fuel cell companies, are, for the most part, far away from 
profitability, Hammerschmidt warned, so they may make for an especially 
speculative and risky investment.
?????Many alternative-energy shares also rallied strongly in 2000--only to 
tumble.






Municipal Utilities Seek Exemptions From Blackouts 
Power: Those connected to state grid, L.A. not among them, say their 
customers should not be deprived to aid others. 

By SCOTT GOLD, Times Staff Writer 

?????A group of California cities that run their own electric utilities and 
have plenty of power to weather the energy crunch this summer will ask the 
federal government today to exempt them from blackouts.
?????Their quiet campaign challenges the very foundation of the power grid in 
California, and could change the dynamics of how electricity is doled 
out--just as the state is bracing for a summer of rolling outages.
?????Most Californians pay large, investor-owned utilities like Southern 
California Edison Co. for power. But about a quarter of households, from the 
tiny desert city of Needles to the state capital, are billed for electricity 
by cities, counties or local districts that run their own nonprofit 
utilities. There are 30 "municipal" utilities.
?????Four of them--serving Los Angeles, Burbank, Glendale and the Imperial 
Valley, east of San Diego--are independent of the state power grid and do not 
face any outages. But the others are required by contract to give electricity 
back to the California Independent System Operator, which runs the grid, by 
participating in rolling blackouts--although they have plenty of power to 
serve their customers.
?????"It makes them wonder why they went out and did their jobs," said 
California Municipal Utilities Assn. attorney Tony Braun.
?????These utilities argue that they are suffering for the myopic decisions 
behind the deregulation of California's electricity market and the power 
shortage.
?????"We believe our power was purchased for the citizens of Riverside and 
that we don't have the right--nor does anyone else--to take it away from them 
when they need it," said Riverside Utilities Director Tom Evans. "Our 
customers are being denied something that they are fundamentally entitled to."
?????Leading the campaign is the tiny Los Angeles County city of Vernon, 
which filed a complaint last week asking the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission to exempt it from rolling blackouts.
?????Vernon's public utility has 2,000 customers, all but 30 of which are 
industrial operations such as glass manufacturers and meatpacking plants. The 
city launched its own distribution system primarily to lure industry with 
electric rates that are typically among the lowest in the state, said Jorge 
Somoano, Vernon's assistant director of resource management.
?????FERC set a deadline today for other municipal utilities to support the 
campaign. Up to half, including Riverside, are expected to either file their 
own complaints or file documents supporting Vernon, said Washington attorney 
Bonnie Blair, who represents municipal utilities in Azusa, Banning and Colton.
?????Even the campaign's supporters are unsure whether it will succeed. Blair 
acknowledged that there is no precedent for presenting this type of legal 
challenge to FERC, which is expected to decide on the issue by mid-June. And, 
she said, municipal utilities might have a tough time proving they have done 
enough to insulate themselves from the energy crisis.
?????Some cities with municipal utilities, such as Anaheim, are not planning 
to join the campaign.
?????Marcie Edwards, general manager of Anaheim Public Utilities, said the 
relationships between municipal utilities and Cal-ISO are too complicated to 
make a clean break. She said it is rare that a power shortage can be blamed 
entirely on the large investor-owned utilities--including this summer's 
energy crunch. And until that can be proved, she said, municipal utilities 
still have an obligation to support California's power grid.
?????"It's not right to go either way 100%," she said. "The fact remains that 
municipals still have an obligation to serve."
?????Most of the municipal utilities are linked to the grid through 
agreements with Cal-ISO that call for them to share electricity in an 
emergency.
?????Those utilities tend to believe that the agreements were reserved for 
natural disasters, such as earthquakes, or other sudden and monumental 
problems, such as a plane running into a transmission line.
?????"The failure or inability of other utilities to schedule sufficient 
supplies," Vernon contended wryly in its papers filed with FERC, does not 
constitute an emergency.
?????"The obligation to share in [rolling blackouts] did not contemplate 
situations where some utilities were not meeting their basic obligation to 
provide resources to serve their customers," Blair said. "If they are forced 
to participate in rolling blackouts, the effect is that the ISO is taking 
energy that has been bought and paid for by some customers and effectively 
giving it to somebody else that has been unable to buy it."
?????Jim Detmers, Cal-ISO's vice president of operations, said the 
organization plans to fight the campaign. He said emergency provisions of 
Cal-ISO's agreements with the municipal utilities cover the current energy 
crunch.
?????Detmers said that exempting municipal utilities from blackouts would 
increase the share of those events shouldered by communities that do not have 
their own electricity distribution. He compared the exemption request to a 
homeowner declining to fight a fire at a neighbor's because he wants to keep 
his water for himself.
?????"What we're dealing with is an overall shortage," Detmers said. "We want 
to make sure that we are making the right choices when everyone's lives are 
at risk."
?????Ronald Nunnally, Edison's director of federal regulations and contracts, 
said the municipal utilities have an obligation to uphold the integrity of 
the power grid to which they are connected.
?????"The ability to use the grid requires to keep it whole, if you will, 
under all circumstances," he said.
?????Blair said those arguments don't hold up. Indeed, she said the municipal 
utilities will argue that the California Constitution expressly prohibits 
giving public property, such as electricity bought by a municipal utility, to 
a private enterprise, such as investor-owned electric companies.
?????"Our customers are paying for it," she said. "That's the bottom line."






A United Defense 

?????The big bad wolf of California's electric power crisis is the private 
power generators, accused of manipulating the market to drive wholesale power 
rates into the stratosphere out of pure greed. Their pricing is insane, but 
only the federal government can fix wholesale prices. The Bush administration 
refuses to do that, leaving the state virtually helpless to deal with what 
many are now calling an energy cartel. 
?????Gradually, however, the state is arming itself in other ways to do 
battle with the big power bullies, who appear more and more to have acted in 
concert to affect prices. Not as blatantly as the oil producers' cartel, 
OPEC, but with even more dramatic results. 
?????What is California considering? 
?????* A new state power agency could build and run its own plants; 
?????* Lawmakers might, as they are threatening, impose a windfall profits 
tax. 
?????* The state could join with other Pacific states in a buyers cartel that 
would simply refuse to purchase power if the price got too high. The idea 
seems a bit desperate, but it has a "Star Wars" allure to it and just might 
work. 
?????The focus is on six big private companies. They produce only about 
one-fourth of the state's electricity, but they are the ones that have power 
available when it is needed the most, as the heat rises, air conditioners go 
on and blackouts are threatened. The private and municipal utilities 
naturally use their own power first, then turn to the outside generators to 
meet additional demand. 
?????The state has forked over $7.2 billion to keep the lights on since the 
biggest private utilities went broke. The cost of power has hit an obscene 
peak of nearly $2,000 a megawatt-hour, charged by Reliant Energy of Houston 
during a recent hot spell. This price, more than 60 times the going rate a 
year ago, prompted a furious Gov. Gray Davis to threaten to use his emergency 
powers to commandeer Reliant's power or even seize one of its power plants. 
?????No one is eager for the state to take over private power plants. That 
smacks of dictatorship. But if the generators can get away with charging so 
much during a brief hot spell in May, what will the cost be in August? 
?????The state is continues to investigate allegations that the six producers 
colluded to control the market or that they shut down plants to create a 
false shortage. The state may take legal action next month. However, even 
that may not force prices down. 
?????The buyers cartel has possibilities. California would get Oregon and 
Washington to join in deciding the highest rate they are willing to pay for 
power this summer, a price still providing the producers a generous profit. 
If the generators wouldn't sell at that level, the states would refuse to 
buy. This would mean more blackouts for a time, but the generators would be 
left with power they could not sell. 
?????This extreme action would not be necessary, of course, if the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission accepted its responsibility under federal law 
and imposed a reasonable temporary cap on wholesale power prices. That is not 
likely If the states are left to their own devices, they can at least join 
forces. Then, for a change, let the seller beware.

Cheney blames Davis for crisis 
'They knew over a year ago they had a problem'

N67797.DTL&type=news 
Washington -- Vice President Dick Cheney, in his most blunt and partisan 
assessment yet of California's energy crisis, faulted Democratic Gov. Gray 
Davis for failing to act quickly enough and called the state's purchase of 
nearly $6 billion worth of energy "a harebrained scheme." 
Cheney, the administration's point man on energy issues, went on a pair of 
Sunday morning news shows to help sell a national energy plan that President 
Bush proposed last week. The discussion inevitably turned to California. 
"They've bankrupted the biggest utility in the state, destroyed the state's 
credit rating and squandered a significant portion of the state's financial 
surplus in a harebrained scheme to try to use the state to purchase power," 
the vice president told Tim Russert of NBC's "Meet the Press." 
A spokesman for Davis responded that the vice president's remarks yesterday 
were "grossly misinformed" and meant to divert attention from the 
administration's neglect of the state and its power woes. 
"The Bush administration has refused to address California's problem, and now 
they're washing their hands of it," Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said. 
The tit-for-tat remarks culminated a week that has seen an escalation in the 
war of words between the Democratic governor and the Republican White House. 
The two administrations are increasingly engaging in a blame game as they 
confront a worsening crisis with enormous political stakes for both sides. 
Responding to critics -- including Davis -- who say the White House has done 
little to help California, the vice president pointed the finger back at the 
state's top Democratic official. 
"They knew over a year ago they had a problem, and Gray Davis refused to 
address that problem," Cheney said. "(They) kept putting it off and putting 
it off and putting it off, with the notion that somehow price caps could be 
maintained. 
"Now, today, where are they in California? Well, rates are having to go up. 
The PUC just had to increase the rates themselves in California. They've got 
rolling blackouts, they've had some already. They'll have them across the 
state this summer," Cheney said. 
Cheney's remarks referred to the state's purchases of almost $6 billion worth 
of energy, which began after the major utilities could no longer afford 
skyrocketing wholesale prices for energy. 
Earlier this month, the Democrat-controlled California Legislature approved a 
bill, opposed by GOP lawmakers, to issue $13.4 billion in bonds to repay the 
state's general fund to avoid making deep cuts in other state programs. 
KEEPING THE LIGHTS ON
"That's the governor keeping the lights on," Maviglio said. "Because of the 
failure of the federal government to act (to impose price controls), the 
state had to move to keep the lights on." 
Cheney's comments came just days after Davis sharply criticized Bush's energy 
plan, saying it wouldn't help California consumers facing rising energy 
bills. 
"Mr. President, you didn't create this problem, but you are the only one who 
can solve it," Davis said in a letter released to the press. "With all due 
respect, Californians want to know, Mr. President, whether you're going to be 
on their side." 
Davis also suggested that by refusing to ask federal regulators for price 
caps, Bush was effectively allowing price-gouging by oil and gas producers in 
his home state of Texas. Cheney dismissed the allegation last week as 
"goofy." 
CALIFORNIA A BAD EXAMPLE
In speeches on his energy plan, the president has mostly used California as 
an example to the nation of what not to do. He warned last week that the 
state's blackouts were a preview of what other states could face if the 
country doesn't boost energy supplies. 
Some California Republican leaders have warned Bush, who will visit Southern 
California later this month, to soften the administration's rhetoric on the 
energy crisis to avoid being seen as unsympathetic to the state's plight. 
Cheney explained yesterday that the administration opposes even short-term 
price controls because they could discourage energy suppliers from selling 
energy into California and building more plants in the state. 
"In the final analysis, it's going to be the private sector's response that 
generates the power we're going to need long-term," Cheney said. 
The vice president did offer an olive branch to Davis, noting that both 
Democratic and Republican lawmakers approved the state's deregulation 
legislation, precipitating the state's energy problems. 
"In fairness to Governor Davis, the screwy regulatory scheme they put in 
place was supported on both sides of the aisle out there," Cheney said. "But 
he was the one who was in charge when it went haywire." 
Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., who followed Cheney on CBS' "Face the Nation" 
yesterday morning, put the blame back on the White House. She recalled that 
President John F. Kennedy called steel company executives into his office 
when they were accused of price gouging. She urged Bush and Cheney to do the 
same with energy suppliers. 
"You have the vice president sitting there, sounding like an oil man," Boxer 
said. "The energy companies are blameless here, he says. And the truth is 
that the facts belie that. 
"He's doing nothing in the budget to help us at all, not even a phone call to 
FERC, not even a jawboning of some of the executives."

Lighting technology leading the way in energy conservation

Imagine replacing your living-room lights with walls that gently glow, or 
your plain glass windows with electronic ones that darken at the press of a 
button. 
Some day, such gee-whiz technologies might save California and the nation 
plenty of energy -- besides bringing (for better or worse) the aesthetic 
taste of the Jetsons into tomorrow's homes. 
In the meantime, researchers are designing less futuristic energy-saving 
gadgets that might be ready in time to help ease the energy problems 
California is facing now. 
Among the technologies under development: unusual ceiling lamps being tested 
in a Bay Area post office; miniature fluorescent lights that offer better 
luminescence than their drab, low-glow ancestors; luminous, flexible plastic 
tubes that emit neat little beams of light; and indoor versions of the 
brilliant sulfur lamps that presently illuminate giant parking lots at night. 
If the history of the past three decades is any guide, energy-saving 
technologies aren't just wacky schemes like the flying cars and 
atomic-powered blimps ballyhooed in 1950s editions of Popular Science and 
like magazines. 
Rather, energy-saving technologies are already an unheralded hero of late 
20th century technology, having saved the nation the energy equivalent of 
numerous nuclear power plants since the last "We're running out of energy!" 
freakouts of the 1970s. 
The next time your smug friends and relatives back east mock California as an 
"energy hog," you can inform them that, in fact, we only use half as much 
electricity per capita as the rest of the United States. A major reason: 
prescient energy-conservation rules developed under then-Gov. Jerry Brown two 
decades ago, according to veteran energy-conservation scientist Art 
Rosenfeld. 
Widely ridiculed as "Governor Moonbeam," Brown and the California Energy 
Commission thought it was wiser to develop tough energy-conservation 
standards for buildings and appliances than to build new nuclear power plants 
-- "and it turns out it was," says Rosenfeld, a current member of the Energy 
Commission and former czar of energy conservation science at Lawrence 
Berkeley National Laboratory, which is funded mainly by the U.S. Energy 
Department. 
Undaunted by the changing political winds of the past three decades, 
scientists at the lab have continued designing energy-conserving 
technologies, even though, at first glance, the new technologies don't look 
that exciting. 
NEW LIGHTING TECHNOLOGIES
Witness, for example, the lamps being tested at the post office in Rodeo. The 
lamps are long, thin tubes that aim light directly onto each carrier's 
mail-sorting station, rather than wastefully spreading it all over the place. 
It's a simple innovation, yet it reduces energy costs for lighting by up to 
70 percent, Lawrence Berkeley researchers have calculated. 
Likewise, they have recently invented a new type of high-performance, 
energy-efficient table lamp that "could greatly reduce the current power 
problems we have in California while increasing the quality of the lighting," 
says researcher Michael Siminovitch of the Berkeley lab. 
The lamp consists of compact fluorescent lights that can be manipulated to 
direct light in different directions -- toward the ceiling, for example. That 
allows the users to fine-tune lighting conditions to their precise needs, 
overcoming common complaints about the dimness and poor design of first- 
generation power-saving lights. 
The new lamps use only one-fourth as much energy as a 150-watt incandescent 
table lamp or a 300-watt halogen lamp. Unveiled in March, they are being 
field- tested by the lab in collaboration with the Sacramento Municipal 
Utility District (SMUD), Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and 
Electric. 
LIGHT-EMITTING DIODES
Looking farther into the future, the old-fashioned incandescent light bulb 
may be challenged by electronic LEDs, or light-emitting diodes, commonly used 
for VCRs and alarm clocks. Those dim little lights may eventually be made 
bright enough, and white enough, to begin replacing traditional lighting 
sources. 
One problem: the refraction or bending of light. Everyone has seen what 
happens when one inserts a straw into a glass of water -- the submerged 
portion of the straw appears to bend. In the semiconductor materials used in 
LEDs, much of the internally generated light is bent so much that it reflects 
back into the LED -- that is, it can't escape. Hence, present LEDs don't emit 
enough light to attract a large commercial market. 
However, engineers at Lawrence Berkeley and elsewhere are designing new LEDs 
that would emit far more light. One of them is physicist Steve Johnson, who 
is confident that LEDs can eventually be made brighter than ordinary light 
bulbs. He points out that colored LEDs are already used in some traffic 
lights. 
By mixing together LEDs that emit different wavelengths of light, one could 
create a white light-emitting LED, Johnson says. (White light is a mixture of 
all other optical wavelengths.) 
Johnson maintains LEDs could make a difference to the energy bill. 
"One-third of our energy used in commercial buildings goes into lighting 
those buildings. So anything we do to reduce the lighting bill is going to 
help the energy crisis." 
SUPER-EFFICIENT APPLIANCES
All sorts of strategies are being tried in labs all over the country. 
Forget to turn off the iron before you drove out of town? Appliances that can 
be switched off remotely, via computer modem, are being developed by the 
Media Lab at MIT as part of its "Kitchen Sync" project. 
The same project is figuring out how to create electronically interconnected 
homes in which the appliances will switch themselves on to perform 
nonessential work -- say, washing the clothes -- only when there's no risk of 
a circuit overload. 
Super-efficient refrigerators that use "magnetic" refrigerants are being 
tested at Ames Laboratory, a federally financed lab in Ames, Iowa. 
Scientists there are using "magnetic cooling" methods to replace the 
compressed gases deployed by typical refrigerators. Physicists have long 
known that some materials get hotter when magnetized and cool off when 
demagnetized. 
Even today's refrigerators consume energy far more efficiently than they once 
did. 
Federal energy standards for refrigerators that took effect in July 2000 
require that they burn only one-fourth as much energy as did their 
predecessors, 25 years ago, Rosenfeld notes. 
Even better, he adds, modern refrigerators are bigger and don't use 
chlorofluorocarbons, chemical compounds that are believed to damage the ozone 
layer, which shields the Earth from cancer-causing ultraviolet radiation. 
"It's all just a matter of designing them properly," Rosenfeld says.

The malfunction of a Pacific Gas and Electric Co. underground cable left 
about 5,000 customers, including businesses at San Francisco's Pier 39, 
without power for more than an hour yesterday afternoon, a company 
spokeswoman said. 
A bad underground cable, called a splice, that connects wires was the cause 
of an outage that began about 4 p.m., said Maureen Bogues of PG&E. 
Customers in North Beach and at Pier 39 were affected, she said. All 
customers had power back by 5:50 p.m. after workers replaced the splice at 
the intersection of North Point and Stockton streets.




THE ENERGY CRUNCH 
Oakland council to vote on waiving energy permits 
Residents' solar, wind power plans for their homes now face high costs, long 
delays Janine DeFao, Chronicle Staff Writer

Oakland -- Already seeing red over rising utility bills, Oakland residents 
have found themselves mired in red tape when they have sought energy 
alternatives such as solar power. 
It can take up to eight weeks and cost more than $1,000 to get the required 
city permits to install solar panels. 
But the City Council is expected to change that tomorrow when it considers an 
emergency ordinance, proposed by Mayor Jerry Brown, to eliminate design 
review requirements for renewable energy installations including solar panels 
and wind devices. 
"Energy is an issue on everybody's plate these days. . . . We want to make it 
easy for people to get their permits and get their panels," said Gary Patton, 
the city's deputy planning director. 
Oakland officials said they know of no other city taking similar steps to 
promote alternative energy generation, although cities throughout the Bay 
Area and the state are increasingly looking to renewable energy sources. 
San Francisco, for instance, is considering placing solar energy bonds on the 
November ballot that would fund installation of solar panels on municipal 
property and could provide low-cost loans for homeowners and businesses to do 
the same. Berkeley also is working on a loan program for renewable energy 
sources for residences. 
The Oakland measure, which would remain in effect for two years, also would 
apply to businesses interested in pursuing alternative energy generation. 
As Californians already hit by the state's energy crunch face the prospect of 
more rolling blackouts this summer, Oakland city officials are receiving a 
growing number of inquiries from residents interested in installing solar 
panels, Patton said. 
The city also has heard complaints about the cost and time it now takes to 
get systems approved. 
Gary Gerber, president of Sun Light & Power in Berkeley, said he complained 
when he learned that it would cost more than $1,200 to install a solar system 
on a home in the Montclair area. The project is on hold, awaiting the new 
ordinance. 
"The process didn't really fit our situation. . . . It's pretty cumbersome 
and is the same type of process you might go through for a major remodel," 
Gerber said. 
City officials "responded beautifully" in drafting a "solar-friendly" policy, 
he added. 
Calvin Wong, director of building services, said the city has received a 
dozen applications for solar panel installations in the last month -- up from 
only a few applications before the energy crisis hit. "We anticipate a lot 
more," he said. 
Gerber said he gets five to 10 calls a day from interested customers. He has 
done as much business in the first three months of this year as he did all of 
last year, he said. 
"I don't think solar panels have been a significant issue for (Oakland) up to 
now," said Councilman Dick Spees, who backs the proposed change. "We want to 
encourage it by making it simple, direct and less costly." 
Oakland also is exploring installing solar panels on city buildings. 
A household solar unit -- which can heat water or produce electricity 
directly -- can cost $10,000 to $30,000, although state rebates can reduce 
the price by half. President Bush's energy plan, released last week, proposes 
a 15 percent tax credit for residents who install solar panels. 
Patton said the "main target" of Oakland's emergency ordinance was solar 
panels, but it would apply to other "renewable energy production facilities," 
including those using wind and water. 
Currently, design review for such installations can cost between $397 and 
$1,088 and take between three and eight weeks, depending on a property's 
location. 
Under the proposal, design review would be waived once an owner submits 
drawings to the city showing that the equipment installation meets certain 
requirements, such as matching the pitch of a sloped roof or, if 
freestanding, being no taller than 6 feet. For certain structures, such as 
designated landmark sites, design review still would be required, but at no 
cost and lasting no more than five days. 
Building permits and inspections, costing between $85 and $170, still would 
be required to make sure the additions are safe, Patton said. 
Brown has long been considered an alternative energy advocate, pioneering 
state solar and wind tax credits when he was governor.

Investigations 
Power firms fueled by greed, Lockyer says 
Out-of-state generators face multiple probes 
Greg Lucas, Sacramento Bureau Chief

Sacramento -- Up the road in Folsom, at the nondescript headquarters of the 
Independent System Operator -- monitor-in-chief of California's energy grid 
-- they have a new job: responding to more than 40 detailed subpoenas. 
The data the ISO keeps on electricity transactions are central to the half- 
dozen investigations initiated by state and federal agencies into various 
parts of the state's energy mess, including possible criminal activity by 
power generators. 
"They're asking for everything and then some," a spokeswoman for the ISO, 
Stephanie McCorkle, said, sighing. 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the state Public Utilities 
Commission, the Assembly, the Senate, the state attorney general and a 
phalanx of state and federal auditors all are boring into California's energy 
mess. 
The main thrust of the most significant investigations is the conduct of 
power generators that have reaped record profits selling electricity to the 
electron-starved state. 
Although most investigators say the ISO's logs and bid records show the 
various generators used their market share to drive up prices, the issue is 
whether they did so acting collaboratively, either directly or indirectly. 
Generators deny any manipulation of the market. They say their prices simply 
reflect a lack of supply, plant breakdowns and the high cost of natural gas. 
But that hasn't stopped the state from trying to prove them wrong. 
Attorney General Bill Lockyer has been probing the actions of the generators 
since August to see if they manipulated the market or engaged in unfair 
business practices or if their executives engaged in criminal behavior. 
"We all feel we've been taken advantage of, been gouged," Lockyer said. "The 
question is whether it's legal greed or illegal greed. There's no question 
it's greed." 
Lockyer is in court fighting energy companies like Reliant Energy Inc. and 
Dynegy, which have refused to disclose internal company information that 
Lockyer subpoenaed Feb. 15. 
The power companies say they are not receiving assurances the documents 
Lockyer wants will be kept confidential. 
Lockyer said he hopes to complete his spadework on the generators this 
summer. 
The PUC also is probing whether generators timed maintenance and shutdowns to 
drive up prices. 
On Thursday, PUC President Loretta Lynch said investigators found patterns of 
plant shutdowns that created "artificial shortages." 
Lockyer insisted that "no one yet has sufficient evidence to win a civil or 
criminal suit. But we're probably further along than any other investigative 
effort." 
Generators say they are cooperating with the investigations -- except for 
worries about proprietary information becoming public -- and flatly reject 
the notion they have been gaming the market or acting in concert. 
"We naturally would take serious issue with some of those allegations," said 
Richard Wheatley, a spokesman for Reliant Energy in Houston. "It doesn't 
compute because we all compete against each other. We don't cooperate, share 
information or anything of that nature. It's not only illegal but unethical 
to do so." 
Said Chuck Griffin, a Mirant Corp. spokesman: "Any patterns would exist 
because of the rules they established long before Mirant was in California." 
A new investigation of the generators is being done also by the aptly named 
Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation in the Wholesale 
Energy Market. It too is meeting resistance from generators in handing over 
documents they consider confidential. 
"Discussions thus far in that regard have been disturbing, and right now 
we're at an impasse," said Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, the committee's 
chairman. 
Dunn's committee can only gather facts and make recommendations on new laws 
if it uncovers some kind of anti-competitive activity not already covered by 
the law. 
So far, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is the only entity to impose 
any economic pain on generators. 
After a probe of California's power market last summer, the commission issued 
an order in December that created a mechanism by which generators would have 
to justify prices above a certain level determined by the commission. 
In March, the commission said generators had to justify $124 million in 
charges -- or reimburse the money. 
It also reached an $8 million settlement with AES Southland and Williams 
Energy Marketing & Trading over power plants that were supposed to be running 
but weren't. 
Critics, from Gov. Gray Davis down, say that generators owe many millions 
more in refunds. 
Several other investigations are either under way or completed. 
The PUC is investigating whether the holding companies of Pacific Gas and 
Electric, Southern California Edison and Sempra Energy in San Diego violated 
the requirement that the utility be their first spending priority. 
The investigation came after discoveries that while PG&E and Edison were 
accumulating huge debts buying power, they were also transferring hundreds of 
millions to their parent companies. 
Probes sparked by power crisis 
Here's a look at some of the investigations California's power crisis has 
sparked and their status: 
Market manipulation by power generators -- The Public Utilities Commission, 
attorney general and a special Senate committee are all investigating 
allegations. 
High prices charged by generators -- The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
said in March that generators must justify $124 million in possible 
overcharges or refund the money. The investigation is still open. 
Investor-owned utilities transferring large sums to their holding companies 
-- The PUC is examining whether any regulations were violated. 
The flaws of electrical deregulation -- The state auditor general completed a 
report in March. 
Audits of the utilities -- A report concluding utilities transferred millions 
to parent companies was released in January by the PUC. 
Price spikes in natural gas -- An Assembly committee issued its report last 
week, saying El Paso Corp. manipulated the market.

Davis slams Bush's energy policy 
He says president should ensure 'reasonable' prices 
Tyche Hendricks, Chronicle Staff Writer

N166290.DTL&type=news 
Gov. Gray Davis blasted President Bush's energy strategy yesterday, saying it 
will fail to rein in galloping energy prices and insinuating that Bush's 
close ties to the oil industry are behind his unwillingness to regulate 
prices. 
Davis, in delivering the Democratic response to Bush's weekly radio address, 
called on Bush to place a cap on wholesale energy prices, which, he said, are 
imperiling California's economy. 
"I urge you to stand up to your friends in the energy business and exercise 
the federal government's exclusive responsibility to ensure energy prices are 
reasonable," said Davis. 
California consumer advocates and utility officials alike endorsed the call 
for rate caps. 
Bush has rejected such caps, although in his radio address yesterday, he 
noted that the average family energy bill has climbed by 25 percent over the 
past three years. 
"That's a hardship for every family," he said. "We need to act to protect 
family budgets." 
His prescription, however, was not for restricting how much energy producers 
can charge, but for increasing energy production by building more power 
plants and drilling for oil in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. 
Yesterday, Bush put into action by executive order two of his 
recommendations, including ordering federal agencies to speed permit 
approvals for new plant and pipeline construction. Still other proposals, 
such as tax credits for hybrid vehicle purchases, will require congressional 
action. 
"It's time to leave behind rancorous old arguments and build a positive new 
consensus," Bush said in the radio address. "With new technology, sound 
regulation and plain good sense, we can expand our energy production while 
protecting the environment." 
Last spring, Davis said, California was paying an average of $30 for a 
megawatt of power. By last week, the price had spiked to nearly $2,000 per 
megawatt. 
"What's going on here, pure and simple, is unconscionable price-gouging by 
the big energy producers -- most of them, incidentally, located in Texas," he 
said. 
Davis criticized Bush's argument that limiting energy prices will deter 
producers from increasing the supply of energy. 
"That's as ridiculous as saying we need to pay dairies $300 a gallon to 
motivate them to produce milk," he said. 
Pacific Gas and Electric Co. officials said they are pleased with Bush's 
emphasis on increasing electricity and natural gas generation and his call 
for improving energy efficiency. 
But a prepared statement by PG&E went on, "We continue to believe that (the 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission) must stabilize the Western market this 
summer through circuit breakers, price caps or cost-based rates." 
Mindy Spatt, spokeswoman for The Utility Reform Network, a San Francisco- 
based consumer advocacy group, said Davis must realize Bush is not going to 
implement price caps. 
"In the absence of federal action, the governor needs to take action 
himself," said Spatt. "He could take plants by the power of eminent domain, 
impose an excess-profits tax (on energy producers), or start a buyers cartel, 
where Western states get together and refuse to pay over a certain price for 
electricity. 
"Davis should take his own advice to the president and stand up to these 
energy companies. The state has spent $7 billion already. He's got to put a 
stop to it or they'll bleed us of every penny we have." 
House Democrats, meanwhile, said yesterday that they intend to begin airing 
television advertising in California beginning tomorrow that accuses Bush and 
Republican lawmakers of failing to combat the rising cost of energy. 
It is unusual for a campaign committee such as the Democratic Congressional 
Campaign Committee to air political advertising more than 18 months before 
elections. But the move was clearly intended to exploit consumer anger over 
rising prices and rolling blackouts.

Power juggling ramped up price 
Insiders say manipulation also strained equipment 
Christian Berthelsen, Scott Winokur, Chronicle Staff Writers
Sunday, May 20, 2001

N121438.DTL&type=news 
Large power companies have driven up electricity prices in California by 
throttling their generators up and down to create artificial shortages, 
according to dozens of interviews with regulators, lawyers and energy 
industry workers. 
Those sources say the unusual maneuvers not only jacked up prices but also 
wore down equipment and contributed to the record levels of plant shutdowns 
that are depriving the state of much-needed electricity. The accounts are 
supported by an independent review of shutdown data by The Chronicle. 
The California Energy Commission calculates that an average of 14,990 
megawatts of generating capacity, nearly a third of the state's total, was 
unavailable each day in April because of plant shutdowns, more than four 
times as much as a year ago. 
Such shutdowns are the subject of increasing scrutiny as California enters 
another period of high demand, the warm spring and summer months of May to 
September, when electricity usage normally grows by a third. 
Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission, said 
last week the agency has found considerable evidence of suspicious plant 
shutdowns. And the California Independent System Operator, which manages the 
state's power grid, says plant shutdowns have now become the primary means of 
constricting supply. 
But an extensive investigation by The Chronicle has found that not only were 
generators shut down to boost prices but these "gaming" tactics contributed 
to the plants' deteriorating condition. 
"We suspected it," said Jim MacIntosh, the manager of grid operations for the 
ISO. "It was a sure factor in driving up prices." Such swings in unit output, 
he said, "would only make sense in a scenario when they're trying to game 
something. Otherwise, why would they do that? They're tearing their units 
up." 
Unusual phone calls 
Operators at a San Bernardino County power plant owned by Reliant Energy Inc. 
say a complex plan to manipulate the California energy market began early 
last year with a series of unusual telephone calls from the company's 
headquarters in Houston. 
According to the accounts of three plant operators, Reliant's operations 
schedulers on the energy trading floor ordered them to repeatedly decrease, 
then increase output at the 1,046-megawatt Etiwanda plant. This happened as 
many as four or five times an hour. Each time the units were ramped down and 
electricity production fell, plant employees watched on a control room 
computer screen as spot market energy prices rose. Then came the phone call 
to ramp the units back up. 
"They would tell us what to do, and we would do it," said one of the men, who 
only agreed to speak on condition they not be identified because they fear 
being fired. "Afterward, we would just sit there and watch the market 
change." 
The workers said frequent and large swings in electricity output began at a 
number of California power plants just as the state's power crisis began in 
earnest. The workers and state power authorities assert the swings were one 
of the primary means of gaming the wholesale energy market. 
"It appears the control rooms are responsive to direction from the trading 
floors in Houston, rather than the reliability needs of the ISO," said Carl 
Wood, a commissioner with the utilities commission who is overseeing that 
agency's investigation into plant outages. "Instead of being responsive to 
demands for reliability, they're responsive to demands for profitability." 
Corporate denial 
Reliant officials adamantly deny using this tactic or any other mechanism to 
game the California energy market. They and other power companies, including 
AES Corp. and a partnership between NRG Energy Inc. and Dynegy Inc., have 
asserted that skyrocketing electricity demand forced them to run aging, 
decrepit power plants harder than ever to meet California's needs. 
While acknowledging that the company issued changes in output levels as 
frequently as every 10 minutes, company officials said it was done at the 
instructions of the ISO to maintain supply-demand balance. 
"As a part of routinely doing business within California and the California 
market design, we are required to do that," said Kevin Frankeny, an 
operations official with Reliant. "When the ISO (issues dispatch orders), 
they dispatch on a 10-minute basis. It can go up and down many times within 
an hour." 
Frankeny said he was not aware of any instances in which Reliant schedulers 
in Houston ordered dispatch changes without the ISO directing them to do it 
first. 
The ISO refused to comment on operations at any specific facility, but 
Stephanie McCorkle, an ISO spokeswoman, said the ramping tactics were used 
beyond dispatch instructions during periods of tight supply. And one of the 
plant operators said the orders to vary output came independently of the grid 
managers. "ISO was not calling Reliant every 10 minutes for that," said one 
of the operators. "Not for an individual unit." 
Officials with the California attorney general's office declined to comment 
on the legality of the ramping practice, citing a continuing investigation 
into whether wholesale energy prices are being manipulated. One source 
familiar with the state of various inquiries said the ramping, if proved to 
have been done to drive up prices, could violate the state's unfair business 
practices laws. 
Invisible practice 
How could companies such as Reliant tinker with output and not get caught? 
One of the plant workers said the practice was designed to be virtually 
invisible to regulators and grid operators. 
When power companies bid on hourly contracts, they agree to produce a certain 
amount of electricity over the given hour. Generators are paid based on an 
average of the spot market prices for that hour. By driving up the spot 
price, they can increase their hourly profits and still produce the total 
amount of energy required. 
The plant worker said the units would be ramped down immediately after their 
output measurement, which was performed at the top of each hour by the ISO. 
Then, he said, it was brought back up as the spot market price of electricity 
rose in response to the reduced output. By the time the ISO measured again, 
the output was back at the expected level. 
Another operator said the units were not always ramped up and down - that if 
the price reached a satisfactory level, generators would raise output and 
remain at that level as long as the price was right. Other times, if the 
price was low, output was brought down and kept down. 
The same operator said the amount of ramping appeared to be a matter of 
individual will of the company schedulers in Houston, with some being more 
aggressive than others. 
"What they would do, especially late at night, is if the price tanked, they 
would undergenerate," an operator said. "Then, mysteriously, the price would 
go up. 
"Then, if the schedule was at 70 (required megawatt hours of output), they'd 
say, 'Go up to 90.' That would cause the price to tank. And they'd say, 
'Bring it down again.' " 
Rapid changes 
These fluctuations occurred within time spans of as little as 10 to 15 
minutes, the operators said. But acceptable rates for bringing a unit from 
minimum to maximum levels when the plant was owned by Southern California 
Edison were more like 80 minutes, to avoid stressing the machinery, one of 
the workers said. Moreover, they were typically run at constant levels, which 
also reduced wear and tear. 
"They were basically ramping up as fast as they can, and then slamming the 
brakes on," said one of the operators. "They were increasing the fatigue on 
the units." 
ISO officials say they changed market operations last fall to crack down on 
gaming tactics, including instituting a so-called 10-minute market, rather 
than the hourly market, so that it could be more easily detected when 
companies were withholding power. 
But the ISO says generator outages have now become the primary tactic in 
driving up energy prices. 
A computer analysis by The Chronicle of shutdown data over a recent 39-day 
period shows Reliant and three other generating companies topped the list of 
plant shutdowns. Reliant also represented the largest amount of wattage lost 
among those companies. 
Plants owned by Reliant, AES, Mirant Corp. and Duke Energy Inc. accounted for 
more than half of the state's unplanned shutdowns, even though their 
generating capacity was no more than 25 percent of the state's total capacity 
from all sources. 
Reliant, one of California's largest and most profitable out-of-state 
generators, reported 319 shutdowns during the period in March and April. It 
was followed by Mirant Corp. of Atlanta (310), AES Corp. of Arlington, Va. 
(278) and Duke Energy North America of Charlotte, N.C. (261). 
Reliant's unplanned shutdowns deprived the system of more than 53,000 
megawatts over the 40-day period, an average of 1,368 per day - enough power 
for 1.4 million homes for one hour. 
Its Ormond Beach plant in Oxnard, with one generating unit down for 26 days, 
accounted for more than 30,000 of those missed megawatts. However, an 
operator who worked in that plant said the outages there appeared to be the 
result of legitimate equipment failures. 
Reliant says there are valid reasons for its plants now to be in need of 
repair. They are old: At 48, Etiwanda is the oldest of Reliant's five 
California plants. And the company says routine maintenance was deferred so 
the plants could remain in service during times of high summer demand. 
But the operators said the issue is not so clear-cut. One problem at 
Etiwanda, a tube leak, had been present for about a month and was previously 
reported to management, they said, but it had not deteriorated much, it was 
operating at full capacity and there was no immediate need to take the unit 
offline because of the problem. 
Moreover, at the time of the shutdown, the ISO had expressly asked Reliant to 
keep the unit online, the operators said. Richard Wheatley, a spokesman for 
Reliant, denied that any Reliant unit was taken offline for unnecessary 
maintenance. 
Ramping may be rampant 
Sources say Reliant was not alone in using the ramping practice. A source 
familiar with the state utilities commission investigation said output logs 
obtained from AES' Alamitos plant also reflected production fluctuations. And 
an operator who has worked at the El Segundo plant co-owned by NRG and Dynegy 
said the practice was used there, although less frequently. The scheduling 
calls came from Dynegy's trading floor in Houston, rather than NRG in 
Minneapolis, he said. 
Steve Stengel, a spokesman for Dynegy, said changes in output at El Segundo 
were a normal function of changing demand levels throughout the day, and 
denied the company was engaged in gaming the California market. 
In a May 2000 report, the California Energy Commission cited Reliant's 
Etiwanda plant, as well as the Alamitos and El Segundo plants, as some of the 
"major beneficiaries of high real-time prices" that spring. 
One way to obtain those high prices, the plant workers said, was the simple 
method of demanding a sky-high price and refusing to deliver power if that 
price was not met. 
On one occasion, one operator said, Reliant ordered a unit at Etiwanda to be 
shut off because the ISO would not meet the price of $1,000 per megawatt 
hour, even though the legal price cap at the time was $750. 
"The operator said, 'It's our unit, shut it off,' " the source said.

Grid officials, others studying planned blackouts 
Posted at 6:43 a.m. PDT Monday, May 21, 2001 
BY JENNIFER COLEMAN 

Associated Press Writer 



SACRAMENTO (AP) -- Could Californians be waking up to hear a weather report, 
a pollen count and an electricity blackout forecast? 
It's not out of the question, say some lawmakers. 
``I actually think it's a thoughtful plan ... to give folks an opportunity to 
understand the likelihood of blackouts on a daily basis,'' Assemblyman Fred 
Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, the Assembly's point man on energy. 
Keeley compared it to ``weather forecasting, to be able to look at the next 
three or four days, have a percentile about the likelihood of blackouts.'' 
The Independent System Operator, keeper of the state's power grid, is 
expected to release a report Monday detailing how such a plan would work. 
The idea is ``to provide a lot of information so people can make choices to 
live with blackouts on a temporary basis this summer,'' Keeley said. 
Peter Navarro, a University of California, Irvine, economics professor, 
released a report last month with a consumer group that recommends the state 
set a price limit on what they'll pay for power. And if generators don't 
lower the price, the state should schedule blackouts to cut consumption, he 
said. 
The report by Navarro and the Utility Consumers' Action Network says the 
state's current method of ``highly disruptive random rolling blackouts'' 
needs to be revamped. 
UCAN suggests that the state be divided into blackout zones that utilities 
could notify ahead of time that power would be cut at a specific time and for 
a certain duration. 
Scheduling blackouts could attract criminals to outage areas, Keeley 
acknowledged, and possibly could subject the state to legal liability for 
traffic accidents or other incidents if power is deliberately shut off. 
``That is a genuine problem and genuine concern,'' Keeley said. ``I think we 
would have to work with local governments so they could have a sufficient 
advance notice to be able to foresee that and try to deploy their resources 
appropriately.'' 
Critics of the planned blackouts said power producers simply could sell their 
unused electricity to other states, or trim back production to keep supplies 
short. 
Assemblyman Mike Briggs, R-Fresno, plans to introduce a bill this week that 
would have the Public Utilities Commission notify businesses and homeowners 
as much as one month ahead of time when they would have their power cut. 
``We owe the people of this state some kind of schedule,'' Briggs said. ``If 
businesses and individuals knew what days their power could potentially be 
shut off or blacked out, they could plan for that blackout accordingly.'' 
The Central Valley Republican said the ability to plan for outages would be 
especially benefit farmers, who need power to irrigate their crops. 
Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, who convened a special subcommittee on 
blackouts, has also suggested the state should consider scheduling daily 
blackouts to cut the state's power use and drive down prices. Democratic 
Assembly members plan to introduce their own version of a blackout plan. 
Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Marina del Rey, has said she envisions giving consumers 
three to five days notice that their power will be cut during a particular 
period, so businesses could opt to shut down or shift their operations to 
nonpeak hours such as nights and weekends. 
And by treating blackouts as a first option rather than a last resort, the 
state could cut its peak power needs and drive down prices, Bowen said. 
California power consumers would in essence form ``a reverse cartel to stop 
the market manipulation and the price gouging,'' she said. 
The planned blackout suggestions come as state officials grow increasingly 
concerned that power prices will keep rising this summer, even beyond the 
extraordinary levels the state already has been paying on behalf of three 
cash-strapped privately owned utilities. 
Gov. Gray Davis said the state paid $1,900 per megawatt hour at one point 
last week. 
The state has dedicated $6.7 billion since mid-January to purchase power for 
Pacific Gas and Electric, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and 
Electric. 
Those expenditures will be repaid this summer when the state issues $13.4 
billion in revenue bonds. The bonds will be repaid by ratepayers over 15 
years.













Planning ahead for blackouts 
Business, services plan for summer crises.
By LOIS EVEZICH
Aliso Viejo News
No sooner did Aliso Viejo become the newest city in Orange County than
California was hit with an energy crisis, threatening rolling blackouts
across the community. Energy issues have already taken a priority with the
council-elect and the city manager.
"We've had some meetings to familiarize ourselves with the situation," said
Interim City Manager William Woollett. "We've hired an engineering firm to
take a look at what kind of organization we need and what kind of budget we 
must have for this issue."
Woollett added that they haven't done anything specific yet, as Aliso Viejo
is not a formal city until July 1.
Hilary McAllister, head librarian at the Aliso Viejo branch of the Orange
County Public Library, said, "All the branches have a plan. We plan to
continue checking out books, only doing the work by hand, as long as it is
safe. Safety is the main issue, and if that is a concern we might have to
close."
Branches in the library system received instructions, said McAllister, and
much of what they decide will have to do with how much warning time they
have.
"We're hoping the power company will warn us," she said.
The library, at 1 Journey, has been exempt from blackouts so far, even when 
other areas in Aliso Viejo were hit. McAllister isn't sure if that has
anything to do with their location right across the street from the fire
station.
Fluor Corporation, with a large facility in Aliso Viejo, which houses 2,300
employees in its corporate headquarters and the five-building campus a
block away, is well prepared for a blackout, according to Lorie Serrato,
media representative.
"We even have blackout kits for the elevators," said Serrato. "They include
bottled water, snacks, and flashlights." She didn't know if there were also
tranquilizers included for those who are claustrophobic.
"We're getting used to taking the stairs," she said. "And we're learning to
save our work on computers more often. That's important."
Barnes & Noble experienced a blackout this winter. For safety reasons,
customers were asked to gather at the front of the store, and business went
on, though not as usual. Customers who knew what books they wanted to buy 
asked employees to find them, and sales were registered on calculators.
For safety reasons, customers were not allowed where there was not adequate 
light.
Barnes & Noble has cut lights in the back room to save energy, and set the
air conditioners to slightly higher temperatures.
Wendy Mortensen, skating school director at the Ice Chalet at 9 Journey,
said, "We've been told that we are on the same power grid as the Sheriff's
Substation and the Fire Department, and that we won't lose power."
Mortensen said that in 90 minutes, not much would happen to the ice, and if
there is a blackout, there is enough light during the day.
"We are only running half the lights," said Mortensen. "And we keep the
offices and the hallways dark to conserve energy."
United Parcel Service is tight-lipped about conservation measures. They
consider it proprietary information, as the measures give them a
competitive edge.
Overall, the company said they can work during blackouts, though it takes a
little longer. The facility does not have much activity during the peak 
energy hours, but if it should happen during heavy work loads, the facility 
can transfer the work to other shifts, or to another UPS facility.
UPS in Aliso Viejo is part of the Edison "Beat the Peak" program, designed
to help companies conserve and prepare. The facility has motion sensors in
the offices, and all employees have flashlights and other equipment as a
safety precaution.
Kmart was awarded a $2 million grant from the California Energy Commission in 
February. It used some of that money to retrofit the Aliso Viejo store with 
energy-conserving store lights that reduce consumption by 40 percent.
The project is still under way, with expected completion in the next several
weeks. Kmart also has uninterruptible power sources it uses as backups, in 
case there is a blackout. These backups provide 40 minutes worth of energy, 
used for the pharmacy and the cash registers. In the event of a blackout, the 
store would close for new customers, but could still service the customers 
already in the store.



















Is price gouging root of crisis? 
The president is "allowing the price-gouging energy companies, many of whom 
reside in Texas, to get away with murder," Gov. Gray Davis said on Thursday 
in response to a George W. Bush energy plan that doesn't call for caps on the 
price of electricity sold by out-of-state generators to California. 
This remark captured the essence of the Davis approach to the energy 
problems: Blame everybody else, call for government price controls even 
though they historically have reduced the supply of energy, and use divisive 
and even conspiratorial rhetoric.
On the same day Governor Davis was blasting the Bush energy plan, his 
appointee who runs the Public Utilities Commission, Loretta Lynch, told a 
newspaper that power generators purposefully keep their plants idle to jack 
up prices. Attorney General Bill Lockyer said that he found evidence of what 
Ms. Lynch called "artificial shortages."
We're interested in seeing the evidence, of course. But it looks suspiciously 
like politicians are using the "power-gouging" theory as a way to bluster 
rather than come up with concrete solutions. It also is a way for those who 
are ideologically hostile to deregulation - perhaps cynical of business and 
capitalism in general - to demonize merchant generators and pave the way for 
a government takeover.
No doubt, wholesale electricity prices have skyrocketed. Prices zoomed from 
$200 a megawatt hour late last year to nearly $2,000 last week, according to 
the San Francisco Chronicle. The newspaper reports that plant shutdowns are a 
cause of the price spike.
Yet a number of analysts have found the price-gouging theory to be dubious. A 
Dow Jones Newswire column analyzed Federal Energy Regulatory Commission data 
on the amount of forced outages over the past two summers. Yes, there were 
nearly four times as many plant closures by plants owned by five big 
producers in summer 2000 than in summer 1999. But, as writer Mark Golden 
pointed out, outages for all plants - including municipally owned ones and 
small Qualifying Facilities that have no incentive to game the system - were 
658 percent higher in summer 2000 than in summer 1999. The writer notes that 
"four of the Big 5 are either constructing big new generators in California 
or have applied for permits to do so. That would seem to fly in the face of a 
withholding strategy."
An April paper co-authored by William Hogan, a professor at the John F. 
Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, could not prove there 
wasn't manipulation, but explained, "it is unlikely to be the dominant factor 
and may not even be significant."
The bigger issue, the Hogan paper argued, is the "seriously flawed" 
restructuring system that caused the electricity market collapse. "[T]he 
principal policy focus should be on fashioning workable solutions for the 
other more serious problems in the market design that relate to the 
underlying causes of the market meltdown."
Other analysts argue that, to whatever degree price-gouging has taken place, 
it is solely the fault of the retail price caps and other government rules 
that have distorted the market.
The large number of shutdowns has not been the result of any conspiracy, the 
power generators say, but the result of needed maintenance on facilities that 
have been overworked. Many of these are older plants that require more 
shutdowns for maintenance than new ones.
"People can invest money in various different markets," Jan Smutny-Jones told 
us; he is executive director of the Independent Energy Producers Association 
in Sacramento, which represents QFs and merchant generators. With politically 
charged hearings, demonization of power generators, proposals for 
excess-profits taxes and threats of seizing property made by California 
Democrats, he said generators may conclude that California is a dangerous 
place to invest.
Gov. Davis said the Bush plan won't add any new electrical power. But neither 
will Davis' grandstanding about price-gougers. 
In fact, it may even dissuade electricity investment. The governor needs to 
apply his "will it create new power?" standard to his own rhetoric, then get 
busy leading the state out of this mess













Generator could help during future energy shortages
City is the first field-trial customer for low-emission device.
By ANNALISA BURGOS
Anaheim Bulletin 
Anaheim has taken several innovative measures to secure reliable power 
sources for its customers. 
One such measure, approved unanimously by the City Council on April 24, is to 
be the first field trial customer for Indiana-based Cummins Inc. and 
Vancouver-based Westport Innovations Inc.'s joint venture 1.5 megawatt, 
low-emissions natural gas power generator.
The Anaheim Convention Center will test the Westport natural gas fuel 
injection technology on a Cummins QSK 60-litre diesel engine generator. The 
technology allows diesel engines to operate on natural gas, reducing
emissions and allowing longer hours of operation, up to 4,000 hours per
year, compared to 200 hours per year from other generators. 
"Public utilities is always looking for new environmentally efficient 
technologies," spokeswoman Melanie Nieman said.
The generator will not be installed until this fall, which means it will not 
be available to help during this summer's power crisis. But officials believe 
it will be a valuable asset.
"The Cummins-Westport generator provides much-needed electricity that meets 
environmental regulations and during peak periods can produce power for less 
than the market cost of power," general manager Marcie Edwards said. 
"The use of such onsite generators enables us to respond to customer needs 
while reducing California's system demand."
The generator will provide off-site, distributed generation that will be able 
to supplement Anaheim's utility grid with power that may be called upon 
during state power emergencies or when the cost of wholesale market power is 
high.
Anaheim gets 80 percent of its energy supply from long-term, power generation 
contracts and 20 percent on the daily wholesale market. In addition, the 
generator can provide about 25 percent of the center's energy load and will 
serve as a source of backup, emergency power.
Westport spokesman Alan Bayless said California's energy shortage made it
an ideal location to test the new technology.
Nieman said the city chose the Convention Center because it needed extra 
backup for its expansion.












Energy-saving measures implemented 
By THERESA SALINAS
The Orange County Register
Stanton City Manager Terry Matz said that energy-saving measures have been 
implemented at City Hall, including the installation of light sensors that
turn the lights on when people enter a room.
The city also has received a $37,000 grant from Southern California Edison to 
replace current traffic signals with energy-saving diode lights. Matz said 
the city is also looking at the possibility of equipping major intersections 
with battery back-up systems to keep signal lights functioning.
Matz said that he is requesting $100,000 be set aside in the 2001-2002
budget to purchase new emergency generators for the Civic Center.






Calif. Utilities Make Accusation



LOS ANGELES (AP) via NewsEdge Corporation  - 
There is evidence that a ``cartel'' of power
companies shut down plants for unnecessary maintenance to increase
energy prices, the head of the California Public Utilities
Commission said. An energy official called the allegation
``idiocy.''


PUC President Loretta Lynch told the Los Angeles Times on
Thursday that her agency and the state attorney general's office
are probing plant outages that she said created ``artificial
shortages'' that contributed to skyrocketing power prices.


``There are instances where plants could have produced, and they
chose not to,'' Lynch said. ``And it is clear that there are
instances that plants, when called to produce, chose not to
produce.'' She said that happened even when plants were obligated
to do so under special contracts with utility companies and the
state.


Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading
Forum, dismissed Lynch's allegations as ``the height of idiocy.''


Power generators have repeatedly said they have been acting
within the rules of the state's deregulation system. The reason
many plants have been down in recent months, Ackerman said, is that
power producers must perform maintenance now in anticipation of
heavy summer demand.


``My members do not make money by shutting down their plants so
their competitors can make money,'' said Ackerman, who represents a
trade association of large power producers.


But Lynch said the probe has produced enough information for the
PUC and attorney general to take legal action next month against
some power generators. She did not identify them, and the exact
nature of the legal action is still under review, she said.


Investigators conducted interviews and reviewed subpoenaed
records, obtained after legal battles with the power companies, to
gather evidence of allegedly unnecessary plant shutdowns, Lynch
said.


Power plants where unplanned shutdowns have happened also were
visited to examine operations and maintenance records, Lynch said.


Power prices have gone from $200 a megawatt hour in December to
as much as $1,900 last week, and plant shutdowns have been a key
factor in the soaring prices.


``I would argue it's no accident,'' Lynch said. ``That in fact
it's due to the coordinated behavior of a cartel.''


Lynch said one suspicious pattern has emerged: When operators of
the state's electricity grid declared a Stage 1 alert, which means
that electricity reserves had dipped below 7 percent, plants that
didn't need repairs were suddenly pulled off-line.




PG&E Targets Business Customers for Energy Reduction; Utility Steps Up 
Efforts to Encourage Conservation; Awaits More State Funding



SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 18, 2001 via NewsEdge Corporation  - 
In conjunction with
its customer education campaign called "The More You Know About
Conserving Energy, the Less Energy You Need," Pacific Gas and Electric
Company has stepped up its efforts to update business customers on the
energy crisis and provide tools to help them conserve energy -
especially in the coming months when power shortages are likely.


The utility is also working with state officials to determine how
best to use the additional funding for conservation and energy
efficiency which is contained in SB5x, signed into law by Governor
Davis on April 11.


The California Independent System Operator has forecast power
shortages of 600 to 3,700 megawatts between now and the end of summer.
Shortages that significant may result in blackouts for millions of
Californians. With little new generation available in time for summer
peak use, along with a continuing reduction of hydroelectric power
from the Pacific Northwest, Californians must adopt rigorous energy
conservation habits if outages are to be minimized.


"The energy crisis has taken its toll on all of us, with higher
energy costs and blackouts, but we recognize that our business
customers are especially hurt because they use a lot of electricity
and outages not only mean a loss of productivity but can damage
expensive, sensitive equipment," said Bev Alexander, Pacific Gas and
Electric Company vice president over energy management programs.
"Since businesses account for about half of customer electricity
consumption, their efforts to conserve have a great impact on
statewide energy use. So, we want them to utilize all the tools
available to reduce their energy use."


Pacific Gas and Electric Company offers advice and incentives to
help consumers make their businesses more energy efficient. Rebates
are available for installing more efficient lighting, HVAC,
refrigeration and other mechanical equipment. The utility has budgeted
$62 million for business energy management programs in 2001. The
funding comes from ratepayers via the Public Purpose Programs charge
on all customers' utility bills and is not impacted by the company's
Chapter 11 proceedings.


In addition, Pacific Gas and Electric Company has proposed to the
CPUC how it could spend approximately $35 million to support
business-related energy efficiency programs from SB5x funds, which set
aside $800 million in taxpayer dollars to encourage residential and
non-residential energy conservation.


The utility also is encouraging customers to take simple steps
such as turning off lights and equipment and adjusting thermostats to
reduce the air conditioning load.


"On a hot summer day, 40 percent of California's energy use is air
conditioning and commercial lighting, " Alexander said. "For example,
if commercial office buildings turned out every other light and set
their thermostats to 75 degrees, we could save roughly 3,500 megawatts
or the equivalent of seven large power plants. Measures like these
could virtually prevent blackouts this summer."


To educate business customers on the energy crisis and steps they
can take, the utility holds informational workshops throughout its
service area, sends newsletters, includes bill inserts, utilizes paid
advertising, the Internet and news stories. Business customers can
obtain information about energy efficiency programs by visiting
www.pge.com/123 or calling the Business Customer Center at
1-800-468-4PGE.


The business outreach program is just one element of Pacific Gas
and Electric Company's customer education campaign called "The More
You Know About Conserving Energy, the Less Energy You Need."


Note to reporters and editors: for details on the available
programs, please also see the fact sheet entitled: "Energy Efficiency
Programs for Business Customers."


ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS


FOR BUSINESS CUSTOMERS


In March 2001, Pacific Gas and Electric Company launched a
customer education campaign entitled "The More You Know About
Conserving Energy, the Less Energy You Need." Along with advertising,
the Internet and news stories, staff from the utility are holding
workshops throughout the service area to educate business consumers on
the seriousness of the problem and what they can do to conserve.


--  With demand for electricity expected to climb in the coming


months and little new generation available, the California


Independent System Operator is forecasting severe power


shortages that will likely result in blackouts for thousands


of Californians.


--  The only way to reduce the threat of blackouts is for all


consumers to reduce their electricity usage. Because Pacific


Gas and Electric Company's 500,000 commercial customers


account for about half of the power used, the business


community has the ability make a big impact with its


conservation efforts.


Programs Available for Business Customers


For 2001, Pacific Gas and Electric Company has enhanced its energy
efficiency programs for business customers to achieve both energy
savings and demand reduction. The company has budgeted $62 million in
2001 to provide energy efficiency programs for business customers, and
is hoping for additional funding to come from SB5x, which the Governor
signed on April 11. The CPUC is currently reviewing how to allocate
the funds.

Power Crisis May Can
Northwest Aluminum 
By Robert Guy Matthews 
? 
05/21/2001 
The Wall Street Journal 
Page A1 
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
PITTSBURGH -- The list of victims of California's botched power-deregulation 
plan keeps growing. 
When California's electricity shortage surfaced last fall, it caused spot 
prices of electricity to skyrocket all along the West Coast. Some aluminum 
companies profited by temporarily closing their massive smelters in the 
Pacific Northwest and selling back their electricity to the spot market or to 
the Bonneville Power Administration, the region's biggest power provider. 
The aluminum industry, which produces nearly 40% of the nation's output in 
the states of Oregon, Washington and Montana, commands a huge amount of 
electricity, enough to power Seattle daily. Closing the smelters freed up a 
lot of power and significantly reduced Bonneville's reliance on the 
electricity spot market. 
But Bonneville now wants the 10 smelters in the region to stay closed for two 
years; business executives, economists and union leaders are just now 
assessing the economic impact of the plan. And for the most part, things 
don't look good for the small Pacific Northwest towns whose livelihoods 
revolve around aluminum. 
For the aluminum companies, closing plants isn't such a bad thing, at least 
in the short term. Besides getting a big chunk of cash from Bonneville, the 
closures will cut nearly 5% of the world's aluminum smelting capacity. Alcoa 
Inc., Pittsburgh, the world's leading aluminum producer, says it's closing 
its Ferndale, Wash., smelter, idling 270,000 metric tons, or 7% of its annual 
capacity. 
With that much aluminum off the market, prices, once expected to drop amid a 
slowing economy, have instead firmed and are expected to rise. Pechiney SA of 
France, the world's third-largest aluminum maker, expects prices to jump at 
least 11% by the end of the year as a result of supply-side bottlenecks. 
Current spot prices for aluminum hover around 69 cents a pound. Alcan Inc. of 
Montreal, the second-largest aluminum maker in the world, says it expects 
more growth and better profits from many of its operations, including its 
specialty-packaging business, rolling mills and production of primary 
aluminum. Meanwhile, producers in India said they plan to take advantage of 
the bottleneck in the U.S. by boosting exports. 
Outside the Pacific Northwest, "existing smelters in the U.S. are pretty much 
operating at capacity," says Michael F. Gambardella, metals analyst for J.P. 
Morgan Securities Inc. "The problems in the Pacific Northwest have kept 
aluminum prices relatively stable despite the current period of weak demand 
for aluminum. The icing on the cake will be when the U.S. economy starts to 
recover. You will see aluminum prices skyrocket." 
For companies using aluminum as a raw material, rising prices may become 
another burden, just as labor and energy costs and dwindling revenue damp 
profits. But the biggest victims will be the rural towns in the Pacific 
Northwest whose economies have relied on aluminum since after the Great 
Depression, when the U.S. government supplied cheap power to run smelers in 
hopes of easing high unemployment. 
Economists believe that if aluminum plants close for two years, they will 
likely stay closed. Operating aluminum smelters isn't like opening or closing 
a 7-Eleven. It costs a lot of money to shut the metal-making operations down 
and then even more money to reboot the entire operation. This is why aluminum 
smelters and similar factories run 24 hours a day. 
Additionally, the way that the smelting operations are configured, aluminum 
companies rack up losses if the plants operate at low capacities. And 
remaining open isn't much of an option after Bonneville signaled that power 
rates will rise sharply in October, when current contracts with the aluminum 
companies expire. Sharply higher rates will make aluminum production 
unprofitable. 
For now, Alcoa said it will not immediately lay off the 900 employees at the 
shuttered Ferndale plant, primarily because Bonneville agreed to reimburse 
Alcoa for employee wages and benefits. 
Still, the news of plant closings is sending shock waves through communities 
such as Goldendale, Wash., a small town on the banks of the Columbia River. 
Together, Goldendale Aluminum Co. and Northwest Aluminum Co. employ about 
1,300 people, more than one-third of the immediate area's working population. 
Those aluminum jobs pay about $58,000 a year in salary and benefits. "The 
jobs created by these industries are the lifeblood of our communities," says 
Mark Sigfrinius, Goldendale's mayor. "They cannot be written off." 
To ease the pain, Bonneville is hoping that it can strike a deal so that the 
aluminum makers in the region will take payments received for shutting down 
and use that money either to retrain the work force or to provide a lump-sum 
payment to help them make it through the two years. But the United 
Steelworkers of America, representing 6,000 workers in the affected Oregon, 
Montana and Washington region, says that its skilled work force would 
probably just leave the region and find work elsewhere under the BPA plan. 
"The union is jumping up and down about this," says David Foster, a 
negotiator for the union. "We intend to make absolutely sure that money comes 
to the union workers. Two years is a long time."

Accounting for Enron: Obstruction Charges Likely to Be First Step in Enron Criminal Case
By Wall Street Journal staff reporters Richard B. Schmitt, Gary Fields and John R. Wilke

01/28/2002
The Wall Street Journal
A6
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

WASHINGTON -- Federal prosecutors likely would file obstruction-of-justice charges first in any criminal case arising from the collapse of Enron Corp., as they look to build a broader indictment based on possible securities fraud, insider trading and tax fraud, lawyers close to the case said. 
Obstruction charges, including any allegations of deliberate destruction of evidence, could come as soon as this summer and likely would be filed in federal court in Houston, these lawyers said. Such initial criminal charges could provide prosecutors with powerful leverage against defendants whose cooperation might then be sought to pursue any inquiry into any underlying crimes, these people said.
Enron's spectacular collapse last month triggered more than a dozen civil, criminal and congressional investigations and already has had significant political repercussions. But for officers and executives of the Houston-based energy-trading company and its former auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, the stakes are highest in the Justice Department's wide-ranging criminal investigation. 
One crucial factor for these men and women could be the dates that any alleged obstruction and fraud occurred. Penalties for most federal white-collar crimes were stiffened Nov. 1, in some cases nearly doubling prison sentences and fines. 
A senior Justice Department official refused Friday to discuss possible charges or other details of the case, except to confirm that it could unfold relatively quickly. Others close to the case cautioned, though, that with investigators still grappling to determine just what happened, few firm decisions have been made about legal tactics or where initial charges should be filed. 
An attorney for Enron said discussion of criminal charges against the company is premature. The company has been cooperating with federal investigators looking into document shredding by its employees, and a report by a special committee of Enron's board looking into the debacle is expected out soon, possibly this week. 
"I think it is grossly unfair to draw any conclusions at this early stage. There is no evidence at all, at least on the part of Enron, that any shredding of documents was criminal in any way. I think before anybody rushes to judgment, they should see what the FBI concludes," said Robert Bennett, an Enron attorney here. 
"This board of directors is trying very hard to reorganize this company, and bring it out of bankruptcy so stakeholders can get paid back and so 20,000 employees can keep their jobs," he added. 
In any event, prosecutors face enormous hurdles. Complex white-collar crime cases can take months, if not years, to untangle, and figuring out what occurred at Enron -- with its hundreds of offshore companies and affiliates allegedly set up to sweep debt from Enron's books and juggle tax liabilities -- could prove especially difficult. At the same time, proving criminal intent in such cases can be tough, and often must be established with circumstantial evidence; what's more, defendants in such cases sometimes argue that they reasonably relied on the advice of lawyers in their actions and decisions, which can make it difficult to establish criminal intent. 
Auditors and lawyers in such cases rarely face prosecution. But Arthur Andersen and Vinson & Elkins, Enron's longtime legal counsel, have been sharply criticized for failing to probe more deeply into concerns about possible fraud. Arthur Andersen or its employees, in particular, could be liable if they knowingly destroyed evidence. A Vinson & Elkins spokesman said the firm's work for Enron met "the highest professional and ethical standards." An Arthur Andersen spokesman said the firm is cooperating in the probe, and noted that it had volunteered information to investigators about the destruction of documents. "We are not speculating on outcomes," the spokesman said. "We are focused on helping them to do their jobs." 
While the investigations are still in their infancy, with new and startling facts emerging almost daily, some defense lawyers and former prosecutors say they wouldn't be surprised if the Justice Department brought initial criminal charges as soon as the summer. 
The government's roadmap in such cases often includes early charges of obstruction for making false statements or destroying evidence. Obstruction charges are relatively straightforward; prosecutors don't have to prove a defendant was involved in any underlying crime, only that he or she lied, destroyed evidence or otherwise hindered prosecutors. And such defendants -- who can face prison time -- often end up being valuable witnesses in guiding investigators through the morass as they attempt to build a broader case. 
"The government loves the obstruction angle," said James Volling, head of the business-litigation group at Minneapolis's Faegre & Benson law firm. "It doesn't come with all the baggage that securities claims often do. It is pretty easy to establish the facts. That is something they clearly will pursue." 
Beyond initial obstruction charges in the Enron matter, "there is a smorgasbord of potential criminal charges," said Henry Hockeimer, a Philadelphia defense lawyer and former federal prosecutor. Already, shareholders have filed civil suits alleging that Enron officers violated securities laws by not disclosing material information about circuitous, off-balance-sheet partnership arrangements. They also have alleged that company officers sold more than $1 billion of Enron stock using inside information that should have been disclosed to the public. 
The same allegations could form the basis of criminal securities-fraud and insider-trading charges if the government thinks it can prove the officers acted while knowing what they were doing was wrong, or were warned and went ahead anyway. Other possible claims include mail and wire fraud, and even violations of the federal bank-fraud statute, if Enron or its officers kept material information from its lenders. 
The timing of specific acts could be an issue if charges are proven in court because sentencing guidelines on hundreds of white-collar crimes got more severe Nov. 1. For example, the maximum penalty for the basic crime of insider trading or fraud in excess of $1 million has nearly doubled, from 37 months in prison to 63 months. Enron is the first major white-collar crime investigation since the new guidelines became effective. 
According to federal sentencing commission statistics, about 10,000 people were sentenced to federal prison for financial crimes in 2000. If the new guidelines had been in place, a third of them would have received more prison time and those sentences would have been an average of 40% longer.

ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: EARLY SCRUTINY
10 Months Ago, Questions on Enron Came and Went With Little Notice
By FELICITY BARRINGER

01/28/2002
The New York Times
Page 11, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

A paramount virtue in journalism is being the first to reveal startling facts. Editors notice. Colleagues notice. Competitors notice. 
Except when they do not.
Ten months ago, Bethany McLean of Fortune magazine became the first journalist to highlight hard questions about Enron's balance sheet. The most startling fact she revealed was the absence of crucial information in the company's financial reports. ''How exactly does Enron make its money?'' she wrote. 
Her questions were so pointed that Enron's chief executive, Jeffrey K. Skilling, called her unethical for failing to do more research. Three Enron executives flew to New York in an unsuccessful effort to convince her editors that she was wrongheaded. Enron's chairman, Kenneth L. Lay, called Fortune's managing editor, Rik Kirkland, to complain that Fortune was relying on a source who stood to profit if the share price fell. 
The lobbying by Enron had no effect on what Fortune published, highlighted on its cover with the headline, ''Is Enron Overpriced?'' Then inertia did what corporate pressure could not do -- it buried the article. Only TheStreet.com picked it up and peppered Enron with critical reporting. 
Even Ms. McLean left leads that were not pursued. She knew, she said, that Enron's chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, was a principal in two partnerships alluded to in the financial statements. But she left it out of her article. 
''I knew it was weird, but the accountants had signed off on it,'' she said. If the accountants, Arthur Andersen, and Enron's board had not questioned it, she reasoned, why should she? Not until October did The Wall Street Journal link Mr. Fastow's partnerships to Enron's write-off of $1.2 billion in shareholder equity. 
As Mr. Kirkland said, Ms. McLean's report ''was prescient, but it kind of went out and sank.'' 
''We didn't have the goods, as it were,'' Mr. Kirkland said. Only last fall, when Enron began to collapse, did more reporters pay attention to the article and to its author. Ms. McLean herself has returned to reporting on Enron. 
Ms. McLean, who is 31, is now the financial reporter everyone loves to lionize. Her photogenic smile and the analytical ability honed at Goldman, Sachs have won her appearances on PBS's ''NewsHour With Jim Lehrer,'' CNN's ''Greenfield at Large'' with Jeff Greenfield, and two NBC News shows. NBC, Fortune executives said, has offered her a consulting contract. 
The arc of Ms. McLean's experience with Enron illustrates the dynamics of financial journalism, which tends to be sucked into the gravitational pull of the stock markets. Companies with highflying stocks tend to get positive coverage; those whose stocks slide tend to provoke critical assessments. 
Other magazines like Business Week and even Fortune had written glowing accounts of Enron's transformative effect on energy markets, and the trajectory of its stock price, which rose about 50 percent in 1999 and about 90 percent in 2000. As Ms. McLean was working on her article, in the midst of the California power crisis, Business Week published a cover article entitled: ''Enron, the nation's largest energy merchant, won't let California stand in its way.'' 
But as the share price rose, Enron's financial reports stayed opaque. One would almost have to have written them to understand them. And few financial reporters have written corporate financial reports. 
Ms. McLean is part of that small group. For three years after she graduated from Williams College with a double major in math and English, she worked for investment banking division of Goldman, Sachs. ''You work literally 100 hours a week, sitting at your computer doing a lot of calculating, a lot of spread sheets,'' she said on Friday. 
She would review the books of companies being offered for sale and write memorandums describing their virtues and faults. ''I learned,'' she said, ''that numbers can lie.'' 
She also had an epiphany about accounting and its potential for abuse. ''When you come out of a liberal arts background,'' she said, ''you want to know why something is the way it is.'' In accounting, ''there is no reason why. There is no fundamental truth underlying it. It's just based on rules.'' 
''These rules create an incentive to get around rules,'' she said. ''This means getting away from any accounting portraying the fundamental economic reality of a company.'' 
Ms. McLean had never practiced journalism. But after three years at Goldman, in a culture where she was never comfortable, she decided to send her resume to several newspapers. She had no takers. Then a friend sent her resume to Fortune. There, she joined its corps of fact-checkers, soon becoming famous for giving no quarter. 
The fame stemmed from her tug of war with Andrew S. Grove, then the chief executive of Intel. He had written an article about how he had decided among possible treatments for his prostate cancer. Ms. McLean, then 25, challenged him on his data. And she was right. Both agree on this, though neither remembers the exact details. ''She did a super job,'' Mr. Grove wrote in an e-mail message last week. ''She was a royal pain but not one person subsequently challenged any facts in my article.'' Later he sought her out to thank her. 
The incident brought her to the attention of John Huey, then the magazine's managing editor. Ms. McLean was promoted and slowly mastered the writing side of the business (paying her editors back for their labors by regularly beating them at pool). 
Five years later, she was tackling Enron, nervously. She had felt indirectly rebuked when her earlier critical financial analysis of I.B.M.'s earnings had no effect on investors or I.B.M.'s share price. Remembering how her judgment had not been validated, she was afraid Mr. Skilling, the Enron chief executive, was right when he implied she had failed to do the work required to understand Enron's financials. 
But events proved him to be wrong. He was not wrong, however, when he told her that similar questions were being asked ''by people who want to throw rocks at the company.'' The first person to flag Ms. McLean to the odd financial statements had been someone who had bet against Enron stock. 
Almost all the reporting on the company at that point was favorable. As James S. Chanos, a short seller who is president of Kynikos Associates, a hedge fund in New York, said in a recent interview, ''The stock price conveys legitimacy.'' 
Short sellers like Mr. Chanos, who pointed Ms. McLean toward Enron, are among the few skeptics in a business where most interest groups -- analysts, investment bankers, shareholders and executives -- profit from a bull market. 
Ms. McLean went on to report about soy milk and Prozac, not Enron. ''The next line of reporting wasn't clear,'' she said. 
But Peter Eavis of TheStreet.com continued to question the valuation of Enron's investment portfolio. Last summer, he reported investor uncertainty about ''how much Enron's earnings have been aided by deals'' by entities like ''LJM Capital Management, whose general partner is Enron's chief finance officer, Andrew Fastow.'' Even the revelation of Mr. Fastow's dual loyalties provoked little attention. 
Maybe, as Mark Roberts, the research director of Off Wall Street Consulting in Cambridge, Mass., said, ''The whole thing was so opaque and so difficult to conceive and so well hidden that it was just beyond the tools of journalists.'' 
Certainly, after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, journalists were distracted. But, in the following weeks, investors were not. As Enron's stock price kept declining, they asked more questions like Ms. McLean's, and they did not like the answers. ''What led to all the revelations and the beginning of the end,'' Mr. Roberts said, ''was a crisis of confidence. 
Ms. McLean is unsure what lessons journalists will learn from covering Enron. ''If we all are more cynical about companies and know that accountants can't be trusted and boards can't be trusted, is that a good thing?'' she asked.

A Fog Over Enron, And the Legal Landscape
By DIANA B. HENRIQUES with KURT EICHENWALD

01/27/2002
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 3
c. 2002 New York Times Company

''ROTTEN.'' ''Horrible.'' ''Indefensible.'' ''Shocking.'' 
With those words, securities law experts around the country condemned the way Enron had structured and sold a partnership called LJM2, which offered investors a chance to profit from confidential information about Enron's investment plans -- and gave the partnership investors more information about the company's finances than Enron's shareholders received.
''This is potentially the most serious revelation about Enron to date,'' said Joel Seligman, a securities law historian and dean of the Washington University Law School. ''You can't overstate how shocking it is.'' 
But did the arrangement, however unfair it seems to stockholders, actually violate the nation's securities laws and regulations? That is far more difficult to answer, legal scholars say -- and far more important. For them, the fundamental question about the sprawling Enron scandal is whether it is a case of strong laws being violated by bad people, or of weak laws rendering such violations unnecessary. 
''If a company of this size, advised by top-tier accountants and law firms, could conclude that our laws permit some of what happened here, then our laws are inadequate,'' said Richard C. Breeden, a former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. ''Clearly it violates the spirit and intent of securities laws and the whole concept of full and fair disclosure.'' 
The quandary is particularly acute in the case of this partnership, because it seemed to thrive on arrangements -- procedural barriers known as ''Chinese walls'' -- that were actually intended to protect investors. These legal barriers prevented investment bankers who were privy to information about the partnership from legally sharing that information with shareholders. Instead, investors remained in the dark about Enron's actual financial condition. 
But the partnership, lawyers and finance experts say, raises novel questions about the effectiveness of other parts of the securities laws, as well. These include prohibitions against trading on inside information; rules against selectively disclosing information to some shareholders and not others; efforts to police corporate conflicts of interest and the wisdom of removing restrictions on the roles that investment banks can play. 
''No matter how good you make the laws, there will always be a small group of people who will push them,'' said John Pound, a former finance professor at Harvard and the president of Integrity Partners, an investment management firm in Boston. ''But the Enron case has raised a lot of useful and important policy questions that will need to be addressed. And the Chinese-wall issue is a perfect example of that.'' 
ENRON'S swift fall, culminating in its bankruptcy filing in early December, came after the company revised its past financial statements to more accurately reflect partnership deals like the LJM2 arrangement. The company and its auditor, Arthur Andersen, are the subjects of both criminal and regulatory investigations, and are being examined by nearly a dozen Congressional committees. 
One important focus of those investigations is the way that partnerships like LJM2 contributed to the company's collapse. Confidential records of that specific partnership, disclosed in The New York Times on Friday, show that Enron tried to attract investors by dangling the prospect of potentially remarkable returns, driven by access to inside information about Enron's financial dealings. 
Potential investors were told, in detail, about the company's off-the-books transactions and assets, information that Enron had not disclosed to its public shareholders. Indeed, partnership investors knew that Enron controlled at least 50 percent more assets than the company had disclosed in its audited financial statements, filed with the S.E.C. and provided to public shareholders. 
That lopsided flow of information strikes many legal experts as a direct challenge to traditional thinking about Chinese walls, the common nickname for the procedures that assure that the confidential information Wall Street firms obtain from their corporate investment banking clients remains confidential, even within the firm itself. 
Chinese walls came into being in the late 1960's, as a regulatory response to the increased complexity of Wall Street firms and a more vigorous S.E.C. response to insider trading, said Michael A. Perino, a securities law professor at St. John's University. 
Their purpose, quite simply, was to prevent an investment banker from using confidential information about a corporate client to make trades in that client's stock -- trades in which the banker would have an advantage over other investors. 
In 1988, at the end of a decade punctuated by insider trading scandals, Congress made such ''informational partitions'' mandatory, citing the need to prevent Wall Street insiders from taking advantage of Main Street investors. 
But in this case, it appears that the protection backfired, legal experts said. Investment bankers who worked on the Enron partnerships were privy to information that may have raised doubts about the information Enron had provided to public investors -- but they were forbidden by law from raising any red flags. 
''The purpose of the Chinese wall is to help public investors, but this worked backwards,'' said Mr. Pound, the former Harvard professor. ''What amazes me is that the people who knew they had information adverse to the public investors would not feel a need to find a way, within the institution, to address that issue -- to go up in the institution high enough to say, 'We have a policy problem here.' '' 
The LJM2 partnership points up Chinese-wall problems that courts and regulators have been struggling to resolve for years, said John C. Coffee Jr., a securities law expert at Columbia University Law School. 
If the investment banking divisions of a brokerage firm had information that raised questions about the value of a public company's stock, there is nothing under the current law that the bankers could do to help the firm's retail investors. But there are more limited actions the firm could take, Mr. Coffee said. 
''They can't go out and privately tell their clients the full information they have received without being part of an insider trading scheme,'' Mr. Coffee said. ''But they could arguably use the information to withdraw their recommendation on the stock.'' That, he added, ''will cause some consternation and adverse publicity that would alert the market to a problem.'' 
OTHER legal experts worry that the investment banks dealing with Enron were constrained by conflicts between their role as lenders and their work as underwriters. 
This conflict, too, has roots deep in American financial history. In the decade before the 1929 crash, banks would sometimes help a failing company sell stock to the bank's customers to raise money to repay the bank's loans. As part of the New Deal, Congress passed the Glass-Steagall Act, which prevented banks from providing both underwriting and traditional banking services. 
But long before Congress officially repealed Glass-Steagall in 1999, both banks and Wall Street firms found legal detours around the prohibition. Now, some securities law experts said, Congress may need to take a fresh look at whether these dual roles in any way affected the flow of significant information to public investors in Enron. 
One specialist in corporate law, who spoke on condition of anonymity because his firm is an Enron creditor, said, ''In a case like this, this perverse effect should be discussed at the very highest levels in the firm.'' 
Mr. Breeden, the former S.E.C. chairman, said no direct parallels to the classic pre-1929 conflicts have appeared. But Enron's evolution ''was a very subtle situation, and very complex,'' he said. 
''In any case,'' he added, ''the public should be able to conclude where the investment banks' greatest interests lie.'' 
That investors in the LJM2 partnership apparently got information that public investors could not get -- because Enron had moved certain operations off its balance sheet -- also underscores the importance of preventing selective disclosure by corporations, one former S.E.C. commissioner said. 
Until last January, corporate executives would routinely hold private briefings for analysts, slipping them details that were not available to public investors. To ''level the playing field,'' the S.E.C. enacted Regulation FD, which forbids such selective disclosure. 
It is not clear from available documents whether partnership investors continued to learn about Enron's finances after the new rule went into effect. ''But if they did, that raises blazing questions of selective disclosure,'' the former commissioner said. More broadly, he said, regulators should determine whether other corporations that use off-balance-sheet entities are giving investors in those entities more information than public stockholders receive. 
SHELDON ELSEN, a securities lawyer at Orans Elsen & Lupert in New York, said the structure of the LJM2 partnership ''really presents some very troubling problems.'' 
''I don't know that there is anything illegal here,'' Mr. Elsen said, ''but there is a terrible odor about it.'' 
James Moriarty, a Houston lawyer who has represented plaintiffs in a number of securities fraud cases, said: ''That they would tell the truth to the rich investors, and lie to their stockholders, is outside the realm of the comprehensible.'' 
Enron might argue that the information potential partnership investors got was not important enough to require disclosure. But lawyers said the fact that Enron disclosed the information to them at all would be evidence in itself that such details were material. 
''Given that they give the information to somebody else as part of their bargain to raise money for another deal, there is a strong likelihood that it would reach the materiality level,'' said Stanley Arkin, a corporate and securities lawyer in New York. 
But the information gap between partnership investors and public stockholders is just one of the conflicts that litter the Enron battlefield, legal experts say. 
Congress is already wrestling with the potential conflicts that confront outside accounting firms, like Arthur Andersen. The firms act both as independent auditors -- which companies must have, by federal law -- and consultants on tax and technology issues. 
But that, too, just scratches the surface. The LJM2 partnership, like several others set up by Enron, was run by a general partnership, LJM2 Capital Partners, and managed by a second partnership, LJM2 Capital Management. The people behind both partnerships -- the ''principals'' -- were all Enron executives, including Andrew S. Fastow, Enron's chief financial officer, and Michael J. Kopper, managing director at Enron's global equity markets group. 
''Investors should be aware that there will be occasions where the general partner and its affiliates may encounter potential conflicts of interest in connection with the partnership's activities,'' the partnership sales documents said. It explained that the principals ''are employees at Enron and owe fiduciary duties to Enron and its subsidiaries; such fiduciary duties may from time to time conflict with fiduciary duties owed to the partnership and its partners.'' 
Enron's board specifically approved Mr. Fastow's role by exempting him from the corporate conflict-of-interest policy -- a step that Mr. Breeden found inexplicable. 
''The very notion that the chief financial officer of a major corporation could have divided loyalties to this degree of magnitude is something I wouldn't have believed any board of directors would allow -- or that any C.F.O. would accept,'' Mr. Breeden said. ''The C.F.O. is the financial conscience of the company, the guardian of the numbers. If he has a conflict, how can the system work?'' 
HE proposed requiring that when any corporate board or chief financial officer approves a conflict exemption, that action must be reported immediately to the S.E.C., and thus to the public. 
What is known about Enron's partnership arrangements so far, he said, reveals an even more profound conflict between management and shareholders. Because Enron had guaranteed the solvency of certain partnerships, obligations that were not disclosed on its balance sheet were secretly but steadily eroding its financial health. 
''It is as if Enron and its top officers had set up a loaded machine gun and aimed it at the company -- and the shareholders didn't know it,'' Mr. Breeden said. 
With so much turmoil still surrounding the investigation -- and with so much uncertainty about exactly what went wrong -- few legal scholars are willing to predict exactly what steps lawmakers and regulators may take to prevent the next Enron. 
But two things seem certain, they said. 
The first is that these fresh disclosures about how Enron's partnerships were structured and sold will expand the number of defendants named in the shareholder lawsuits aimed at trying to recover some of investors' market losses, which have been estimated at more than $60 billion. 
Every large institution -- whether an underwriter or partnership investor -- that was aware of material information withheld from Enron investors could find itself in court, securities lawyers said. Already, they said, lawyers who specialize in suing corporations are discussing which investors, institutions and advisers are potential defendants. 
''The image I have in my mind is a long, long line of the wealthy and the powerful who made money out of these deals, all set up to hand it over to the people who lost everything in their Enron investments,'' said Mr. Moriarty, the Houston lawyer. ''This is what the Marines like to call a target-rich environment.'' 
The second consequence is likely to be systematic Congressional action to amend the nation's securities laws, said Mr. Seligman, the law school dean and regulatory historian. 
The securities laws enacted in the New Deal were ''a response to the general public belief, after the 1929 crash, that there were two securities markets -- one for privileged insiders and one for everyone else,'' Mr. Seligman said. Enron's LJM2 partnership ''smacks of that world,'' he added. And when the American public believes two such markets exist, he said, ''Congress -- every time, regardless of party or president -- has acted to address that concern.''

ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: THE PROSECUTOR
Noted Brooklyn Prosecutor Joins U.S. Inquiry Into Enron Collapse
By PHILIP SHENON

01/28/2002
The New York Times
Page 10, Column 3
c. 2002 New York Times Company

WASHINGTON, Jan. 27 -- The Justice Department has named a leading organized-crime prosecutor from New York to its investigation of the collapse of the Enron Corporation, department officials said. 
The prosecutor, Andrew Weissmann, chief of the criminal division of the United States attorney's office in Brooklyn and the lead prosecutor in the 1997 trial that ended with the imprisonment of the reputed head of the Genovese crime family, is described by colleagues as a tenacious investigator and litigator.
Department officials said they hoped the appointment of Mr. Weissmann would be seen as additional evidence that the Justice Department's Enron inquiry would be aggressive, despite the many ties between the Bush administration and senior Enron executives who were among the largest contributors to President Bush's 2000 campaign. 
Attorney General John Ashcroft has recused himself from the case because he accepted contributions from Enron in a failed campaign for re-election to the Senate. 
Mr. Weissmann will report to Leslie R. Caldwell, a career federal prosecutor in the United States attorney's office in San Francisco who has been named to head the Enron investigation. Ms. Caldwell, chief of the securities fraud division in the prosecutor's office in San Francisco, has a reputation for toughness and for helping juries make sense of complicated criminal cases. 
Mr. Weissmann, 42, has handled a variety of cases in Brooklyn but is best remembered for his prosecution of organized-crime figures, most notably Vincent Gigante, the reputed head of the Genovese crime family. 
Mr. Weissmann won a 1997 conviction of Mr. Gigante on charges of murder-conspiracy and racketeering, overcoming defense claims that Mr. Gigante was incompetent to stand trial. Mr. Gigante was known for walking around Greenwich Village in a bathrobe and pajamas, which resulted in his being dubbed the Oddfather. 
Mr. Weissmann, a graduate of Princeton University and Columbia Law School, was born and raised in New York. He has worked in the United States attorney's office in Brooklyn for 10 years, the last two as chief of the criminal division.

THE FALLOF ENRON Convictions for Enron Execs Would Be Hard Won
ERIC LICHTBLAU; DAVID G. SAVAGE
TIMES STAFF WRITERS

Los Angeles Times

WASHINGTON -- Although Enron Corp. may have destroyed thousands of documents, misled shareholders and left the retirement accounts of many of its employees nearly worthless, legal experts say the prospect of serious criminal convictions of corporate executives is far from certain. 
Despite some recent success in corporate fraud cases, prosecutors must overcome daunting hurdles, including changes in federal regulation of insider trading, the vagaries of securities law and the sometimes conflicting agenda of congressional investigators, according to law professors, attorneys who specialize in white-collar crime and law enforcement officials.
Evidence that Enron destroyed documents related to the company's meteoric collapse offers the most compelling prospect for a criminal case, suggesting possible obstruction of justice charges, legal experts and law enforcement officials agree. 
But it could take years for authorities to build more serious charges of conspiracy, insider trading or securities fraud against Enron's higher-ups, and even then it may prove tough to return convictions, experts predicted. 
"Financial fraud cases are very hard to prove. [Executives] can say they made bad business judgments, but you have to prove unanimously and beyond a reasonable doubt that they deliberately intended to deceive" the public and their shareholders about the company's finances, said Columbia University law professor Jeffrey N. Gordon. 
Even as FBI investigators began descending on Enron's Houston headquarters last week to probe possible crimes, they probably will confront several legal and political realities that could work to Enron's advantage. Among the potential roadblocks: 
* The entire U.S. attorney's office in Houston has pulled out of the investigation because too many prosecutors are related to Enron employees, forcing the Justice Department to create a special task force that must start from scratch in probing the energy company's labyrinth of partnerships. 
* Democrats already have called for an independent counsel to probe Enron's well-documented political connections to the Bush administration, but the demise of the outside counsel law in 1999 has muddied the process for determining how and when to appoint an outside counsel. 
* A recent rule change at the Securities and Exchange Commission, authorizing prearranged sell-offs of executives' stock, gives added insulation to allegations of insider trading and could provide former Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth L. Lay and other executives with a built-in defense. 
* And Congress' zeal to conduct high-profile hearings on Enron could complicate the use of testimony from witnesses who become part of the criminal probe, as happened in the Iran-Contra scandal. In that case, charges against Oliver L. North and John M. Poindexter were thrown out in 1990 because their prosecutions were deemed tainted by immunized congressional testimony. 
Coordinating Immunity Offers 
Justice Department officials have begun discussions with Congress on how to coordinate immunity offers that Congress might make to witnesses, such as David B. Duncan, the partner at accounting firm Andersen who oversaw the Enron account. Duncan, who since has been fired, invoked the 5th Amendment last week before a congressional committee rather than answer questions about the destruction of Enron documents. 
The department hopes to blunt the effect that any congressional immunity deals would have on future criminal cases. 
"We never like to see potential witnesses paraded before Congress, but that's always a danger in a case like this," acknowledged a law enforcement official who asked not to be identified. 
Enron spokesman Eric Thode said it would be premature to discuss any criminal allegations, noting: "We'll just let the investigations take their course, and, of course, we're cooperating fully." 
Despite the obstacles that prosecutors face, authorities are buoyed by the recent progress they have made in several other high-profile financial fraud cases. 
In Pennsylvania, the former chief financial officer of apparel maker Leslie Fay Cos. was sentenced last week to nine years in prison for inflating the company's earnings by $81 million. The scheme forced the company into Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for four years. 
In San Francisco, former executives at health services giant McKesson Corp., are facing civil and criminal charges for allegedly concocting bogus revenue figures. The losses for the company's shareholders: $9 billion. 
And in New Jersey, in a case with even more telltale similarities to Enron, the former chairman and vice chairman of Cendant Corp.--a franchiser whose brands include Howard Johnson, Avis and Century 21--are awaiting trial on charges of conspiracy and securities fraud. 
Authorities allege that Cendant, in perhaps the longest-running scheme of its kind, was "cooking the books" for more than a decade, with former Chairman Walter A. Forbes reaping $30 million as the company's stock soared amid misleading financial reports. 
Once irregularities in the company's accounting were exposed in 1998, the value of Cendant's stock plunged $14 billion in a single day. 
Cendant and accounting giant Ernst & Young, accused of whitewashing the irregularities, agreed last year to pay a near-record total of $3.2 billion to shareholders who claimed they were defrauded by the scheme. 
But Forbes and former Vice Chairman E. Kirk Shelton, who have declared their innocence in the affair, are not expected to go to trial until late this year, about 4 1/2 years after the scandal first broke. That arduous legal path is testament to the difficulty of bringing such complex financial fraud cases, law enforcement officials say. 
"It's a brutally hard case," said one official close to the Cendant prosecution. "It takes a special accounting knowledge, it's an incredible paper trail, and you have to have cooperators. We had [three] people pleading guilty, all the ones just below the top. . . . Without them, it would be a much more formidable task" to prosecute the company's top executives. 
Reports of widespread shredding of Enron documents give authorities substantial leverage to try to persuade witnesses to cooperate, experts said. 
"As a prosecutor, you are looking for evidence that the senior people had knowledge of the scheme," said San Francisco attorney Stephen Meagher, a former prosecutor of white-collar crime cases. 
"And typically, when you find documents were being destroyed, that answers the question. That means certain people were aware of problems and they were determined to destroy the evidence. It's the prosecutor's dream come true because it shifts the burden to the other side. They have to explain what they were trying to hide." 
Duncan, the Andersen auditor, has spoken with federal investigators at least twice, a sign that he may be willing to cooperate in exchange for a plea deal. 
It remains to be seen whether Duncan or someone at Enron turns out to be the star witness prosecutors are seeking. But Columbia Law School professor John C. Coffee, a securities specialist, noted that "historically in white-collar crime cases, you have a trail of falling dominoes, and you start low and offer leniency to cooperate and get evidence against the higher-ups. I think you're going to get a whole succession of people cutting deals here." 
The danger, however, is that such witnesses have a potential credibility problem: If they admit to destroying documents, will a jury believe their testimony fingering higher executives? 
"Those aren't necessarily the most credible witnesses on the stand," said Paul Fishman, a former Justice Department official who specializes in white-collar defense. 
Sending a Strong Message 
Beyond the obstruction issue, law enforcement officials say possible charges against executives at Enron and Andersen could include securities fraud, insider trading, wire and mail fraud, conspiracy and even racketeering. 
The case, if it can be proved, would hinge on a simple premise: that executives fooled the public and its shareholders into thinking the company was more profitable than it was--and enriched themselves in the process as the company's stock went up in value. 
The corporation itself faces possible indictment and criminal penalties, but legal observers said anything short of indicting top Enron executives could be seen as a failure in the eyes of the public. 
"Indicting a bankrupt company achieves next to nothing," Coffee said. 
Indeed, Duke University law professor James D. Cox said indicting Enron executives would send a strong message. 
"If they are serious about eliminating financial fraud, this is the battle the government needs to take on," he said. "This looks to be a case of purposeful manipulation of earnings and purposeful concealment of debt. They created a truly false facade." 
Class-action lawsuits against Enron maintain that Lay made more than $100 million from stock sales before the company's value plummeted. But Lay's lawyers have maintained that many sales were from prearranged sell-offs, which could give him insulation under a rule adopted by the SEC in 2000 regarding what constitutes insider trading. 
The so-called 10b5-1 rule holds that even if insiders possess sensitive corporate information, they can legally buy and sell company stock so long as it is part of a prearranged trading plan. The SEC and various courts have wrangled over how the new rule should be interpreted, and allegations of insider trading against Lay and other Enron executives could prove "a key test," said Jill Fisch, a corporate and securities law expert at Fordham Law School. 
Fisch compared the Enron probe to the financial scandal that led to the conviction of former junk bond kingpin Michael Milken and other Wall Street traders in the 1980s. 
As in the Milken case, Fisch said, she believes Enron is "an impure case on a lot of legal questions." But, she added, the public backlash--fueled by headlines about document shredding--may be enough to drive the investigation in the absence of clear law.

Building the House of Enron: As Enron's Derivatives Trading Comes Into Focus, Gap in Oversight Is Spotlighted
By Michael Schroeder
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

WASHINGTON -- As the significant role that derivatives played in Enron Corp.'s downfall comes into focus, lawmakers and regulators are lining up in favor of more oversight of these risky investments. 
While the Houston-based company's core energy operations involved natural-gas and electricity transmission, its largest and most-profitable business was trading derivatives -- unregulated financial instruments that derive their value from an underlying commodity or wager on the future. Now, information is surfacing that Enron's derivatives trading may have been used to mask weakness in the company's other businesses such as fiber-optic bandwidth, retail gas and power, and water systems.
"Enron was more of a hedge fund than an energy company," said Rep. Richard Baker (R., La.), chairman of a Financial Services Committee panel that is looking into the derivatives issue, in an interview. 
After listening to testimony at his committee's Enron hearing last week, Senate Governmental Affairs Chairman Joseph Lieberman said he would hold a hearing specifically on the need for derivatives regulation. The Connecticut Democrat was responding in part to the testimony of San Diego University law professor Frank Partnoy, who outlined a series of methods that he said Enron used "to create false profit and loss entries for the derivatives Enron traded." 
To ensure that Enron met Wall Street quarterly earnings estimates, it used derivatives and off-balance-sheet partnerships, or so-called special-purpose vehicles, to hide losses on technology stocks and debts incurred to finance unprofitable businesses, Mr. Partnoy said. In addition, he said, "it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies." The entries, he said, "were systematic and occurred over several years, beginning as early as 1997." 
Based on independent research and conversations with Enron traders, Mr. Partnoy said he learned that some traders apparently hid losses and understated profits, which had the effect of making derivatives trading appear less volatile than it was. Randall Dodd, director of the Derivatives Study Center, an independent, nonpartisan Washington group, said in an interview that he has reached similar conclusions. Mr. Dodd is advising three government agencies and three congressional committees investigating Enron. 
Declining to address specific allegations, Enron spokesman Vance Meyer said in a statement, "Derivatives were not our business. They complemented our core business of buying and selling natural gas and power." Mr. Meyer also said: "I think it's safe to say that we are not going to agree with every view about Enron presented in the congressional hearings, but we do respect the process and hope, when all is said and done, that something positive will come out of it." 
In 1989, the energy company, originally a utility that produced and transported natural gas and electricity, had begun shifting its focus to energy trading. The derivatives included not only Enron's very profitable trading operations in natural-gas derivatives, but also the more-esoteric financial instruments it began trading recently -- such as fiber-optic bandwidth and weather derivatives. 
During 2000 alone, Enron's derivatives-related assets increased from $2.2 billion to $12 billion, with most of the growth coming from increased trading through its EnronOnline, an Internet trading system, according to Enron's financial reports. Mr. Dodd figures that if Enron were a bank, it would rank as the 10th largest derivatives dealer. 
Innovations in technology and finance have helped obliterate clear distinctions between banks, brokerage firms and newer hybrids, such as Enron. But financial regulators hew to decades-old divisions of authority, continuing to keep a close watch on banks, brokerage firms and conventional exchanges, while leaving new entrants such as Enron to police themselves. 
In late 2000, Congress passed legislation that exempted from regulation over-the-counter derivatives, which are contracts arranged among sophisticated buyers and sellers such as banks, Wall Street firms and public companies. The measure had support from both parties, as well as the Federal Reserve and the Clinton administration. 
Advocates of derivatives say the instruments give companies, investors and lenders a way to reduce their exposure to many kinds of financial risks. Most regulators and financial-industry executives insist that the country's financial system remains sound. 
But the Enron scandal spotlights an enormous void in the nation's system of financial regulation, and it is rekindling a thorny debate over just how that gap should be filled. 
As a publicly traded company, Enron routinely provided the SEC with general information about its finances but wasn't obliged to divulge to any agency detailed information about its over-the-counter trading activities. 
In the wake of Enron's bankruptcy, federal energy regulators say they plan rules for energy-derivatives accounting. Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill said derivatives regulations may need modernizing. 
"In this case, I think it's fair to say it may be that our rules and regulations have gotten behind practices," Mr. O'Neill said in a recent interview on the "Charlie Rose Show."

ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: SEEKING EVIDENCE
Hard-to-Miss Box of Scraps Catches F.B.I. Agent's Eye
By MICHAEL BRICK

The New York Times
Page 10, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

HOUSTON, Jan. 27 -- Agents of both the F.B.I. and the Securities and Exchange Commission have expressed interest in reviewing the remains of documents that a former Enron executive said were recently shredded at the company's headquarters. 
An F.B.I. agent here approached lawyers for shareholders who are suing Enron to discuss the documents, the lawyers said. The shareholders' lawyers had displayed a box of shredded documents last Tuesday. The agent also talked to lawyers representing Enron. The S.E.C. also has pursued the matter by issuing a subpoena to the former executive, Maureen Castaneda, people familiar with that investigation said.
The S.E.C. had already issued subpoenas to more than 30 Enron employees in a variety of departments, according to several people, including an Enron employee who received one in December. The subpoena to Ms. Castaneda was issued last week, when she discussed the documents in interviews with ABC News and The New York Times. 
It is not clear what the documents said or why they were shredded. The federal judge in the shareholder lawsuits, Melinda Harmon, ordered an accelerated schedule of information gathering last week. Shareholders' lawyers had argued for haste, and they said they had reason to believe destruction of documents was continuing. 
An Enron spokesman said the company is cooperating with investigations about the shredded documents. ''It's a good time to let the facts come from the proper authorities investigating this,'' Mark Palmer, a spokesman for Enron, said. ''We are the ones that called the Justice Department.'' 
The documents were generally shredded horizontally rather than vertically, so it is possible to make out words and even sentence fragments. The shreds include accounting records, and some bear the names of the off-the-balance-sheet partnerships that have been linked to transactions allowing Enron to keep some of its problems hidden. 
Shareholders' lawyers have said they might eventually try to reassemble the documents, but it is unclear whether government investigators will make a similar effort. 
Mr. Palmer said he did not know whether Enron usually shredded documents horizontally. The company has said it repeatedly ordered employees not to destroy documents that could be relevant to investigations. It announced on Oct. 31 that the S.E.C. had upgraded its inquiry to a formal investigation. 
Knowingly destroying records that have the potential to be of interest to government investigators would be a crime. Investigators did not signal that the documents discussed by Ms. Castaneda were definitely of interest until after the shredding took place and became public. 
Ms. Castaneda made her comments last Monday. The next day, the S.E.C. notified shareholders' lawyers, who have been working with her, that a subpoena had been issued for Ms. Castaneda's appointment books, all documents concerning entities that have had dealings with Enron and all documents related to Enron other than her pay stubs. 
The F.B.I. agent approached the lawyers for Enron and those for its shareholders in the courthouse last Tuesday to discuss the box of shredded paper that the shareholders' lawyers had put on a table in the courtroom. A lawyer for Arthur Andersen, Enron's accounting firm, suggested in court that the shredded documents should be turned over to the Justice Department. 
The F.B.I. agent did not take the documents, so they remained in the possession of Milberg Weiss, one of the law firms suing Enron. A spokesman for the firm said it would work with Ms. Castaneda's lawyer to comply with the subpoena. 
One possible reason the agent may have left the documents alone is that if they were taken for a criminal investigation, they might be subject to grand jury secrecy rules. Such rules would not apply in a civil investigation. Thus, investigators in a civil inquiry, such as S.E.C representatives, can share the information with F.B.I. and other criminal investigators. But criminal investigators might be prevented by grand jury secrecy from sharing the documents with S.E.C. investigators. 
A lawyer for Ms. Castaneda declined to comment.

ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: LEGAL STRATEGY
SHREDDED PAPERS KEY IN ENRON CASE
By KURT EICHENWALD

01/28/2002
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

For all its eye-popping revelations, the Enron case presents an enormous challenge to government investigators, one that could require years of digging to unravel. At this point, no one knows for sure whether the actions that led to the collapse of the company constituted financial crimes, and, if they did, which should be the focus of the investigation. 
For that reason, legal experts said, the best things that happened for the criminal investigators in the case were the decisions by employees at Enron and its auditor, Arthur Andersen & Company, to begin shredding documents.
Unlike the financial investigations, which will require forensic accountants to unwind complex transactions, the document shredding gives investigators comparatively simple cases of possible obstruction of justice. In such cases, witnesses are confronted, evidence is collected, the law is checked, and the decision whether to seek an indictment is made. 
As a result, these experts said, the focus in the earliest days will be on pursuing possible criminal cases from those events. 
The government's intent will be to use the leverage of potential indictments to push possible defendants into the role of witnesses to get evidence for the broader financial investigation. ''The potential obstruction of justice is critical to the progress of this investigation,'' said Efrem M. Grail, a former prosecutor who is a partner with the Pittsburgh law firm of Reed Smith. ''It is easier for the government to make an obstruction of justice case than it is to make a case that people violated criminal securities law or criminal fraud statutes.'' 
It is critical to start with such limits, legal experts said, to make sure that the case does not go off track, especially in its earliest days. 
''It's essential that the government disciplines itself during the investigation and reins in the scope of the inquiry,'' said Chris Bebel, a former federal prosecutor and former lawyer with the Securities and Exchange Commission. ''Otherwise, it is going to get bogged down in a sea of documents and conflicting statements about complex transactions.'' 
According to people who have spoken with government officials involved in the case, there is strong pressure from senior Justice Department officials to show some quick results from the investigation. That pressure will increase the attention focused on matters like document destruction, where the facts are relatively easy to establish. 
Until now, the most public investigations have been those conducted by a series of Congressional committees. But none of them have the power to bring charges in the case. That responsibility falls instead to prosecutors working on a special Justice Department task force and to a group of agents with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 
On the regulatory side, one investigation is being handled by the enforcement division at the S.E.C. The Labor Department is also reviewing whether Enron violated any rules while the stock price was plunging when it told employees that they could not sell company shares from their retirement accounts. 
For government investigators, the scandal presents a difficult challenge. In contrast with other well-known white-collar investigations, this inquiry begins with the government's having little guidance on where it should be looking. 
Unlike the insider trading scandals on Wall Street in the 80's -- which began with revelations from Ivan F. Boesky, a stock trader -- the Enron inquiry has no central witness to provide a map of criminal activity. Unlike the Treasury market scandals that enveloped Salomon Brothers in the early 90's, the Enron investigation begins with no admission from the company that it did anything improper. Unlike the price-fixing cases at the Archer Daniels Midland Company, later in the 90's, the Enron case does not have years of incriminating tape recordings provided by a cooperating witness. 
''In this case, unlike in those in the past,'' said Stephen Meagher, a former federal prosecutor who handled white-collar cases in San Francisco, ''there are many dimensions, and you just don't have a clear trail to a central theory of the prosecution.'' 
As a result, the government begins the first major corporate scandal of the new millennium with no strong handle on whether the trouble was brought about by criminal activity or folly. The distinction is critical. Experts say any criminal case stemming from the Enron collapse would be related to some sort of fraud: tax fraud, wire or mail fraud, securities fraud. 
But to get such an indictment, prosecutors would have to prove that the people charged had criminal intent -- that they knew they were engaging in fraud when they were committing the acts in question. 
In other words, if Enron executives or advisers filed or disseminated information about the company that has since proved to be false, the government must be able to demonstrate that they knew about the falsehoods at the time. In this case, establishing such proof could be challenging. 
According to internal Enron documents, every major transaction between the company and the series of partnerships that played a role in the collapse were supposed to have been reviewed by senior company managers and by Arthur Andersen, the company's auditor. 
If information about such deals was presented to Andersen truthfully, and the accountant rendering the opinion was clear of any undisclosed personal or financial conflicts, those rulings by the accountants will be some of the most important weapons in any defense lawyer's argument against indictment. 
Enron officials would effectively be left saying that they had relied on the professionals, and the professionals would maintain that they had offered unbiased judgments -- even if those judgments subsequently proved to be wrong. But here again, legal experts said, the document destruction will probably prove to be critical in giving investigators a means of combating that challenge. 
''Without document destruction, the auditors would have been explaining that they made judgment calls,'' said Franklin B. Velie, a former federal prosecutor now with the law firm of Salans Hertzfeld & Heilbronn in New York, ''and the company would have been saying that they relied on the auditors. 
''It would be hard to know whether this was a horrible mistake or a crime. With document destruction, the path for the investigators seems a lot clearer.''

ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: THE VICE PRESIDENT
Cheney Is Set to Battle Congress To Keep His Enron Talks Secret
By ELISABETH BUMILLER

01/28/2002
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

WASHINGTON, Jan. 27 -- Vice President Dick Cheney said today that the White House was prepared to go to court to fight the release of documents demanded by Congress as part of the investigation into any influence the Enron Corporation had in formulating the Bush administration's energy policy. 
Mr. Cheney said that the General Accounting Office, the agency demanding the documents, was overstepping its authority and that he had a right to keep the documents secret to preserve his ability to get ''unvarnished'' advice from outside consultants.
David M. Walker, the head of the General Accounting Office, responded this evening in an interview that it was now ''highly likely'' that he would file a lawsuit against the Bush administration if Mr. Cheney did not turn over the documents by the end of this week. Of the vice president's assertion that the agency was overstepping its bounds, Mr. Walker, the comptroller general of the United States, replied, ''Talk is cheap.'' 
It would be the first time that the accounting office, the investigative arm of Congress, sued another government department for not cooperating with an inquiry. 
In interviews on the ABC program ''This Week'' and ''Fox News Sunday,'' Mr. Cheney said that it was the right of the president and vice president to keep secret meetings like those that Mr. Cheney and his energy task force had over the last year with Enron executives as the administration devised its energy policy. 
''What I object to,'' Mr. Cheney said on ''Fox News Sunday,'' ''and what the president's objected to, and what we've told G.A.O. we won't do, is make it impossible for me or future vice presidents to ever have a conversation in confidence with anybody without having, ultimately, to tell a member of Congress what we talked about and what was said.'' 
At issue is how much Enron, a major contributor to the Republican Party, influenced the Bush energy plan, which eases environmental rules, opens public land to drilling and provides tax incentives to energy companies for exploration. Enron and the White House have acknowledged that Enron executives met five times with Mr. Cheney or members of his staff about energy last year, and documents from the meetings could show whether the administration policy mirrored any specific recommendations of Enron's. 
A lawsuit would increase pressure on Mr. Cheney, who is under criticism from Democrats for his relationship with Enron, the giant energy trading company that filed for bankruptcy protection and that has ties to officials in the Bush administration. 
''Now, the fact is, Enron didn't get any special deals,'' Mr. Cheney said on ABC. ''Enron's been treated appropriately by this administration.'' 
Mr. Cheney also said that turning over the documents would be detrimental to the presidency. 
''We've seen it in cases like this before, where it's demanded that presidents cough up and compromise on important principles,'' Mr. Cheney said. As a result, he said, ''we are weaker today as an institution because of the unwise compromises that have been made over the last 30 to 35 years.'' 
Some Republican strategists have begun to worry that Mr. Cheney's stance is contributing to perceptions that the White House has something to hide on the issue. The New York Times/CBS News Poll published today showed that a majority of Republicans believed that the administration had not been forthcoming about its dealings with Enron. 
Mr. Walker, a member of the Reagan and first Bush administrations, who was appointed by President Bill Clinton in 1998 to a 15-year term as comptroller general, said that he did not agree with Mr. Cheney's position that he was allowed to keep the meetings secret because of his position as vice president. 
''This is not about the vice president's constitutional position,'' Mr. Walker said. ''It's about his capacity as chairman of the national energy policy development group. From Day 1, this has not had anything to do with the constitutional position of the vice president. I know they want to present it that way because they think people will be more sympathetic, but that's not factually accurate.'' 
Mr. Walker said that it was his view that the White House had put Mr. Cheney in charge of energy policy for that very reason -- to claim executive privilege and avoid oversight of the group by Congress. ''But that's a loophole big enough to drive a truck through,'' Mr. Walker said. 
Mr. Walker also took issue with an assertion by Mr. Cheney that the accounting office was pursuing the information only because of the political heat generated by the Enron scandal. In the ABC interview, Mr. Cheney said that the accounting office first pursued the documents last summer but then relented under the administration's stance that the information was privileged. 
''The G.A.O. sort of backed off,'' Mr. Cheney said. ''They in effect said, 'Well, maybe we aren't going to pursue it at this point.' What's re-energized it now is the question of Enron, and some efforts by my Democratic friends on the Hill to try to create a political issue out of what's really a corporate issue.'' 
At least 10 Congressional committees are investigating the Enron debacle. 
Mr. Walker responded that Mr. Cheney's statement was ''absolutely false'' and said that the accounting office had been prepared to go to court in September, before the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon occurred. He decided, he said, to wait until the crisis had abated before pursuing the matter. 
An administration official said today that it was likely that any court fight over the documents would take years, and that the White House was convinced it had a strong case. 
White House officials continue to say that the Enron debacle is a financial scandal, not a political one, and point out that the president's approval ratings remain high, above 80 percent. White House officials also say that even if Mr. Cheney turns over the documents, this will only whet the Democrats' appetite.

Enron and the Lawyers

The New York Times
Page 14, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

In the Enron scandal, the accounting industry has been the profession taking the most heat. Before the dust settles, however, it seems inevitable that more questions will be raised about the role that lawyers played in Enron's alleged misdeeds. 
Some of those concerns are already being raised about Vinson & Elkins, Enron's law firm. When the time came for a review of some of the company's questionable partnerships, Enron's internal whistleblower, Sherron Watkins, a vice president, urged the company's chairman, Kenneth Lay, not to assign the task to Vinson & Elkins, since it had approved some of the very partnerships that needed to be investigated. Even so, the assignment was given to that very law firm, which concluded that problems with the partnerships were just cosmetic. It is likely that investigators will want to examine the legal work of Vinson & Elkins, and whether it told Enron about the law firm's possible conflict in the matter.
Other law firms and lawyers will no doubt also be caught up in the investigation. Much of the Enron scandal involves complex financial arrangements that teams of lawyers helped to cobble together, and to which law firms gave their professional imprimatur. If any of these arrangements were in fact illegal, the lawyers may have been in the best position to know. 
The Enron scandal is already producing cries for reform in the accounting industry. Senator Barbara Boxer wants to prohibit accountants from consulting for companies they audit, as Anderson did for Enron. The accounting industry is reportedly in talks with the Securities and Exchange Commission about ways accountants can better regulate themselves. 
It would be gratifying to report that the legal profession had been similarly moved. Despite the recent revelations, the organized bar appears to be regressing on the subject of financial fraud. Last August, an ethics commission presented the American Bar Association with proposals for easing the organization's model rules on lawyer-client confidentiality so that lawyers need not remain silent while their clients engage in illegal activity. The A.B.A. adopted one proposal permitting lawyers to speak out to prevent clients from committing crimes reasonably certain to result in death or serious bodily harm. But it defeated a second proposal that would have let lawyers break confidentiality to prevent their clients from committing fraud reasonably certain to substantially injure the financial interests of another. 
The A.B.A. is meeting again this week in Philadelphia. Despite the intervening Enron scandal, there is apparently little chance it will reconsider its financial fraud vote and some chance it will reverse last August's reform. Even though the association's model rules are largely advisory, this would be precisely the wrong message right now. 
As scrutiny turns from accountants to lawyers in this scandal, the legal profession should be looking for ways to assure Americans that when fraudulent activities are under way that threaten their livelihoods, their investments and their pensions, lawyers will be on their side, not on the side of the criminals.

Here we go again. Another parade of lawyers. A gaggle of attorneys. A flock of law firms. This is a lawyer full-employment act. A "Who's Who" of litigators. A full-court press. The lawyers are hiring lawyers. Hang on, sports fans. Buckle your seat belts. It's going to be a bumpy column. 
If we're pulling out all the cliche{acute}s, we must be talking a Washington scandal.
If it's the scandal du jour, it must be Enron Corp. 
Thank goodness. This column will write itself. Even the cliche{acute}s will write themselves. Where do we begin? We begin at the eye of storm, with Enron. Of course, we need a massive legal personality to fill the role of chief defender of the alleged corporate plunderer. Robert S. Bennett of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom fits the bill. We just love our blustery Bob Bennett. We've missed his work defending President Clinton during sex scandals. So it was a delight to see him ride out of the corral with both guns blaring, firing at the media and the Congress as Enron's lawyer. 
But you could just hear a sigh of sadness in the media, though, when reporters realized that David Boies would not represent Andrew Fastow, the chief financial officer who is the supposed mastermind of the partnerships under the microscope. No, it is just a member of Boies's firm, Boies, Schiller & Flexner, who is representing Fastow. 
No slouch himself, Richard Drubel of the firm's New Hampshire office will handle Fastow's civil defense. Who is Drubel and how did he get the call? Turns out that he worked at Susman Godfrey, one of Enron's Houston firms, and Drubel was friends with Fastow there. While known for plaintiff suits, Susman Godfrey also has defended Enron. 
Fastow's case apparently is so complex that he has two other lawyers and law firms -- David Gerger of Foreman, DeGeurin, Nugent & Gerger, who is working the Justice Department angle, and Lawrence Iason of Morvillo, Abramowitz, Grand, Iason & Silberberg, who is handling the Securities and Exchange Commission aspect of the investigation. 
Arthur Andersen has Daniel Kolb and Michael Carroll of Davis Polk & Wardwell. David Duncan, lead partner of Andersen's Enron auditing team until he was fired, has retained Robert J. Giuffra Jr. and Gandolfo V. "Vince" DiBlasi of Sullivan & Cromwell. 
Vinson & Elkins, Enron's primary outside law firm with which Enron has many close ties, has turned to a big-gun litigator for its defense: John Villa of the District's Williams & Connolly, the lawyer and firm that lawyers and law firms turn to when they're in trouble. 
I think we've run out of space. Somehow we'll get to the rest of the Enron lawyers. Let's stretch this out over several columns. There's plenty of time. This isn't going away. We could devote a couple of columns to the plaintiffs' attorneys. More to come. Stay tuned. To be continued. 
Antitrust Follies 
Looking for a little something different? Something not as untoward as the Enron debacle? A little bit lighter fare? Then I suggest you turn to the antitrust division of the U.S. Justice Department, and the Federal Trade Commission. Can we find better vaudeville in town than the antics of antitrust chief Charles James and FTC Chairman Timothy Muris? 
You missed the show? It was Jan. 17 when James and Muris called in the news media at the FTC to announce a deal between the Justice Department and the FTC on how to divvy up antitrust review of industry mergers. Now, this should have been a no-brainer. The old system is so convoluted and confusing that Hearsay does not understand how it works. 
But we'll try to explain it anyway. 
There are a handful of industries in which both the FTC and Justice Department have expertise. So when a hot merger comes up, and the staff of each agency wants a piece of it, the assistant attorney general for antitrust and the FTC chairman have to sort it out. This had been done in an ancient ritual that included a series of athletic events such as arm wrestling, mud wrestling, greased-pig wrestling and a bull-riding competition, and an essay contest. 
Okay, we're making that up. Well, most of it. The agencies really do write essays explaining why they are best to review the mergers. And there really has been a lot of wrangling over who would get to review a merger. The "discussions" would last more than two weeks sometimes, and that's almost half the 30 days in which investigators must decide whether to launch a more detailed review, called a "second request" for documents. Delays of more than 15 days occurred 32 times in 2000. 
The system needed to be fixed. 
So, what did James and Muris do? 
First, they came up with what on its face seems like a sensible plan: The Justice Department would get oversight for media, telecommunications and entertainment industry mergers, while the FTC would get health care, energy and electricity cases. 
So, they have that good idea. But there's a problem. They devise it in secret. They don't tell many people about it, to keep it a big surprise, or in hope that opponents won't be able to stop it. They don't even share the plan with all the other members of the Federal Trade Commission. They keep many of the stakeholders out of the process. And finally -- and this is the funniest part -- they keep members of Congress out of the loop. 
This happened once before at the antitrust division. Last time, it was when the Justice Department abandoned the plan to break up Microsoft Corp. Hello? Is anybody home? Did you forget that this is a democracy, with three branches of government and all? 
At this point, we reveal that Hearsay is biased: We prefer things be done in the open, in public, where there is a vigorous debate and hashing out of all of the ramifications. In the marketplace of ideas, the strong ones prevail. If this truly were a good idea, it would have prevailed. This did not have to be controversial. 
One member of our democracy is Sen. Ernest F. "Fritz" Hollings (D-S.C.). He is chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee. That's a pretty important committee. Lots of bills important to the Bush administration go through that committee. James and Muris didn't tell Sen. Hollings about their big plan. That did not please the senator. And, as the senator might say, he squealed like a pig stuck in a gate. 
His hootin' and hollerin' were enough to halt a signing ceremony scheduled for 1 p.m. Jan. 17 as the media waited in a room nearby. In fact, Muris signed it anyway. James did not. Reporters had press packets, complete with statements hailing the deal. Now it had to be called off. 
Someone pass the popcorn. This is getting good. Who would have thought that the Bush administration antitrust team would be so entertaining? 
The news conference was abruptly canceled without explanation. Later, spokeswoman Gina Talamona offered a statement saying the plan was a good one, but Justice Department staff would meet and confer with Congress. 
So how is the conferring going? Here is a report from a meeting on Thursday, as provided by Hollings's press man, Andy Davis. "DOJ staff admitted that they had not consulted with consumer groups in any way before formulating their proposal," Davis said in an e-mail. "Additionally, they had no statistical data to demonstrate each agency's expertise. Instead, they relied solely on anecdotal evidence." 
Hmmm. Doesn't sound like a very good first meeting. 
In the meantime, perhaps James and Muris could read up on the U.S. Constitution. There's a very sobering line in there about appropriations coming from Congress. 
What were they thinking? Well, this is a pattern that seems to be developing with our antitrust enforcers. Unlike Robert Pitofsky, the previous FTC chairman, who made an effort to develop consensus on policy questions, James and Muris seem to like to keep their best ideas hidden from the public, politicians and the media. Pitofsky spent more than a year in public developing his plan to require spinoffs of companies and divisions before mergers are approved. 
One person involved with the process, however, offers this commentary about Hearsay's thesis: "That's absurd." Rather than a marketplace of ideas, this is a power play, according to the source. This person says that Pitofsky and James's predecessor, Joel Klein, attempted to craft such a deal but failed. The mistake, this person suggests, was to go public with the plan. 
The idea that secrecy is better than openness is very sad. 
In some ways, the handling of this resembles James's failure to get nine states to sign the Microsoft agreement. Most of those attorneys general, with the exception of California's and Massachusetts's, were eager to settle the case. But James failed to build a consensus and moved forward without them. In swinging toward Microsoft's position, James appeared to do little to try to address problems that several key attorneys general had with his deal. As a result, damage has been done to the years of work to build amicable relations between federal and state antitrust enforcers. 
Too simplistic? Maybe. After all, Hearsay doesn't pretend to be as smart as Muris and James. 
Look at this way: From a spectator's standpoint, it has been quite a show. 
Big Billings 
So, you think Sen. Robert G. Torricelli (D-N.J.) got off scot-free? Hardly. The penalty is steep when you're under investigation, even when charges aren't filed. 
Torricelli's latest congressional filing shows that his legal bills totaled more than $1.37 million in 13 months. 
The bills will continue to accumulate as the Senate Ethics Committee considers U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White's three-year investigation into his political fundraising. The case closed this month without charges against the senator, but seven people were convicted of making illegal contributions to his 1996 campaign. 
So far, Torricelli has the bills covered: He's raised about $1.54 million. 
Who wins? The lawyers, of course. In the fourth-quarter filing, the first-place finisher is Ted Wells Jr. of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, whose firm billed $195,750. Second place goes to Abbe David Lowell of Manatt, Phelps & Phillips, which billed $20,000. 
Other billers for the final three months of 2001 include Sidley Austin Brown & Wood ($10,000), Zuckerman Spaeder ($10,000), Pierce Atwood ($10,000), and Winston & Strawn ($10,000). Torricelli's ex-wife, Susan Torricelli, also got a piece of the legal defense fund: $5,000. 
Hearsay tries to build consensus every other Monday in Washington Business. Send your cliche{acute}s to hearsay@washpost.com.

Accounting for Enron: White House Resists Detailing Cheney, Enron Discussions
By Jeanne Cummings
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration, struggling to manage the political fallout of the collapse of Enron Corp., is walking a tightrope between aggressive disclosure of government ties to the firm and adamant opposition to releasing the details of Vice President Dick Cheney's private meetings with Enron officials. 
In an appearance on Fox News yesterday, Mr. Cheney said the White House will go to court to block the General Accounting Office, Congress's investigative arm, from learning what was discussed in six meetings he and his staff held this past year with executives of the Houston energy-trading concern, which filed for U.S. bankruptcy-court protection this past month. Three of those meetings occurred while the vice president's office was drafting the administration's national energy policy.
Meanwhile, on Friday, the Office of Management and Budget asked the General Services Administration to re-evaluate all government contracts with Enron and its auditors, Arthur Andersen LLP. An OMB senior aide said the work could include as many as 100 contracts with a total value of about $70 million. 
Both actions come as public polls suggest Enron could become a political issue for President Bush and his party going into the midterm elections this fall. A New York Times poll released yesterday found 58% of respondents said they think the White House is mostly telling the truth but probably is hiding something. Republican veterans in Washington worry that the White House showdown over the meetings between Mr. Cheney and his staff with Enron officials could nurture those suspicions. 
Chief of Staff Andrew Card said on NBC's "Meet the Press" that a compromise is still possible with the GAO. But Mr. Cheney said the White House decided in August that it would fight the disclosures in court rather than yield on the principle that the vice president should be able to receive private advice from outside experts while formulating policy. The Enron saga, he said, shouldn't be allowed to "undermine" the White House's position. 
"The president's bound and determined to defend those principles and to pass on this office, his and mine, to future generations in better shape than when we found it," the vice president said. "For us to compromise on this basic, fundamental principle would, in effect, do that. It would further weaken the presidency, and we don't want to do that." 
Further, Mr. Cheney characterized the GAO as a pawn of Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D., Calif.), who has taken the lead on Capitol Hill in scrutinizing Enron's sway on the administration's energy policy, which was released this past spring. 
On Friday, Mr. Waxman's office released records that suggest a State Department energy plan was amended by the White House to add a provision urging the U.S. government to use its influence with India to maximize development of natural gas in that country, where Enron has a natural-gas-fired power plant. The draft was changed after a meeting between the vice president's office and Enron officials, according to Mr. Waxman's staff. 
OMB Director Mitch Daniels's call for a review of all Enron and Arthur Andersen government contracts was prompted by disclosures of shredded documents, even after an investigation into Enron's financial accounting was launched by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr. Daniels said both firms now may be ineligible for government work based on a Federal Acquisition Regulation provision that says a business contracting with the government must have a "satisfactory record of business ethics and integrity." 
Mr. Daniels said the GSA should analyze whether Arthur Andersen and Enron are qualified for future contracts, and "consideration should be given to the initiation of suspensions or disbarment proceedings for all, or a part, of Arthur Andersen and Enron as appropriate." 
Arthur Andersen spokesman Patrick Dorton said, "We have a demonstrated track record of excellent performance for government clients. We will certainly address any questions and would welcome the opportunity to discuss our strong history in government consulting." 
An Enron spokesman said he was unaware of any formal investigation but would respond to any request for information. 
The two firms' government work doesn't appear to constitute a large part of their businesses. Enron, once the largest energy trading business in the world, has a $25 million contract to run the utilities at Fort Hamilton in Brooklyn, N.Y., which army officials said is already under review. 
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick J. Leahy (D., Vt.) in the past week questioned the appropriateness of an Arthur Andersen contract with the Federal Bureau of Investigation since the auditing firm is now part of a Justice Department criminal probe of the Enron collapse. The $700,000 management-consulting contract is for work Andersen is doing to help reorganize the FBI and could provide them with access to confidential and sensitive documents, Mr. Leahy said.

Ideas & Trends: Power House
Greed, Pain, Excesses. Oh, What a Lovely Issue.
By RICHARD L. BERKE

01/27/2002
The New York Times

WASHINGTON -- ONCE they express their requisite sympathy for stockholders and investors in Enron, many Democrats are downright giddy over the company's implosion. Not since Watergate and Richard M. Nixon's cozying up to corporate bigwigs wielding bags of money, they say, has their party had such an ideal vehicle to arouse the citizenry and skewer a Republican president as favoring monied interests. 
''It's Teapot Dome,'' said Jim Hightower, the former Texas agriculture commissioner who has built a career on speaking for the disenfranchised. ''It's a perfect populist crusade.'' Though, unlike the Harding administration scandal, no one in this administration is known to have acted illegally regarding Enron.
Stanley B. Greenberg, who helped devise a populist theme for Al Gore in the 2000 presidential campaign, said the Democrats' rallying cry in the November elections should be: ''The greed is real. The pain is real. The excesses are real.'' 
And the reality is that the issue could be potent for the Democrats, though some are wary of rushing headlong into making Enron a political issue and caution that the company spread its bounty to both parties. Yet Enron was far more generous to Republicans and has closer ties with Republican officials in government. 
Republicans are especially vulnerable because Enron reinforces the long-held perception that their's is the party of big business and the rich. The White House is already a target because the administration is stocked with officials formerly involved with the oil industry in Texas. Even religious conservatives, a powerful constituency for the Republican Party, are grousing that their president is showing more fealty to corporate titans than Christian leaders. 
Adding to the image of a party more attuned to corporate interests than ordinary Americans was the recent election of Marc Racicot as Republican Party chairman. He refused to sever his ties to a law firm that has lobbied extensively for Enron and other companies. The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll, published today, underscores the image of a White House run by the upper crust. It reports that 61 percent of Americans say big business has too much influence in the administration. And 50 percent said the administration's policies favor the rich; only 14 percent said they favor the middle class. 
Democrats may have the best opportunity to capitalize on Enron if they do not retreat to the simplistic anti-big business slogans of decades past. Nearly a century ago, President Theodore Roosevelt scored by demonizing the Standard Oil Company as representing the evils of the newly sprouting corporate giants -- and shattering it into 34 pieces. 
While the age of trustbusting is long gone, Democrats could portray Enron as symbolizing the evils of a new corporate economy fostered by giant stock purchases and multinational companies. They can expand their argument and point to other disastrous business collapses, like Kmart, as evidence that corporations are running roughshod over working people. ''If they're smart, the Democrats' strategy should be to make Bush into another shifty-eyed J. R. Ewing,'' said Kevin Phillips, the political analyst who wrote ''The Politics of Rich and Poor.'' ''If they dig deep enough, they can strike gold: that this guy has been up to his neck in every facet of the oil business in Texas, and it often hasn't reflected well in his judgment.'' 
But turning Enron into a big-business-versus-the-little-people bonanza for the Democrats could be more knotty than it seems -- and not just because Enron spread its largess to Democrats as well. 
For one thing, Democrats can no longer fully disassociate themselves from industry. President Clinton courted big business -- and it was his White House that presided over an era of prosperity for corporate America. 
There is also a history of populist crusades falling flat. Most recently, voters were not altogether convinced in the 2000 campaign when Mr. Gore ridiculed the Bush tax cut proposal as ''a form of class warfare on behalf of billionaires.'' 
In the 1980's, the Democrats' drive to make villains of junk bond trading firms backfired, as did President Harry S. Truman's brazen seizure of big steel companies in 1952. ''Standing up for the little guy will always be part of Democratic Party politics,'' said Senator Evan Bayh of Indiana, chairman of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council. ''But we suffer from the stereotype of resenting people who have been successful even if they have done nothing wrong. We don't want to play into that stereotype.'' 
There is no question that Enron can help Democrats stir up the party faithful, just like Whitewater galvanized hard-core conservatives. The question is whether the Democrats can broaden the appeal of the issue. 
To do so, they cannot merely repeat the party's mantra that Republicans favor the rich, but would have to take the argument to the next step: not only that Republicans are responding to corporate interests, but that they are doing so at the expense of ordinary citizens. Even some religious conservatives have accused the administration of overlooking their interests in favor of big business. Many were furious when, at the Republican Party's winter meeting in Austin, Tex., this month, the party installed Lewis Eisenberg, an abortion rights activist who has contributed to Democrats, to head the party's drive to raise money. Mr. Eisenberg's appeal: he's close to business and knows how to get big donations. 
''It was a terrible appointment,'' said Gary Bauer, a conservative who ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2000. ''Couldn't they find a chief fund-raiser who actually agreed with the party's platform?'' 
On the other side of the political spectrum, Mr. Hightower said it would not be sufficient for Democrats to assure voters that ''we're on your side.'' He said the party needed to take its argument several steps forward. ''We need to wrap up not just the corruption of money in politics but the actual damage to people and pensions and the disrespect for workers and the flim-flam of the new economy,'' he said. 
Recognizing that such populist appeals could succeed, Mr. Bush, in a striking change of tone, said last week he was outraged by the conduct of Enron, and noted that his own mother-in-law had lost more than $8,000 in Enron shares. 
AS part of their offensive, Republicans are seeking to shift the spotlight to Democrats who took Enron donations, and they portray the Enron debacle as a business scandal with no partisan bounds. In fact, White House officials are questioning why regulators in the Clinton administration did not pick up on the transgressions at Enron. 
Dismissing the Democrats as trying to politicize the Enron collapse, Dan Bartlett, the White House communications director, said, ''The American people are savvy enough to understand the difference between political rhetoric and fact -- and the fact is that the administration did not make any attempts to help Enron.'' 
James Carville, the Democratic consultant, countered that the question is not whether the administration acted to save Enron. ''It's not what they did when they went belly up,'' he said. ''It's what they did when Enron had money.'' 
But, like many other Democrats, Mr. Carville is not free of Enron entanglements. He said he agreed to deliver a speech last October for the corporation for his usual big fee. The company went belly up, so he never could offer his words of wisdom. But chances are, his remarks would not have been about corporate greed.

How a Top Medical Researcher Became Entangled With Enron
By JO THOMAS with REED ABELSON

01/28/2002
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 3
c. 2002 New York Times Company

HOUSTON, Jan. 26 -- Travelers at the airports here notice the children, frail and bald, on their way to the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, but thousands more arrive unseen, by car. There were 20,000 new patients last year, including 500 children. Most were from Texas, but others came from across the nation and the world, hoping for a cure. 
In the five years since Dr. John Mendelsohn, a respected cancer researcher, became president of M. D. Anderson and began courting wealthy donors, politicians and volunteers, the cancer center's research budget has grown 71 percent and the number of patients has increased by 49 percent. Prominent in both Houston and the medical community, he is well spoken, and persuasive, about the needs of M. D. Anderson and the promise of his own research. Last fall, when former President George Bush, a longtime supporter, became chairman of the board of visitors, the center raised $10.3 million in a single gala at Enron Field.
Now, at what should be the pinnacle of his career, Dr. Mendelsohn finds himself in the middle of accusations surrounding two controversial companies: Enron, whose collapse is the subject of intense scrutiny by Congress and regulators, and ImClone Systems, a biotechnology company that is being accused of misleading investors about the possible approval of a drug that Dr. Mendelsohn was instrumental in developing. Dr. Mendelsohn serves on the boards of both companies. 
In an interview this week, Dr. Mendelsohn spoke of his involvement with both companies. Despite criticism about his ability to serve as a director, representing shareholders' interests, Dr. Mendelsohn defended his independence and integrity in his involvement with both companies. 
While Dr. Mendelsohn's role at ImClone has received less scrutiny, his directorship at Enron has been attacked as symbolic of the lack of independence on the board. 
Joining Enron's board in May 1999 and serving on the audit committee, Dr. Mendelsohn had a pivotal role in overseeing the company's relationship with its auditor, Arthur Andersen, and the integrity of the company's financial statements. 
In addition to questions about whether he had the expertise to serve on the committee, there are concerns that, as a fellow member of the Houston elite with Enron's chairman at the time, Kenneth L. Lay, he was reluctant to question management and someone who appeared to be a fellow visionary. Mr. Lay and his company were also generous contributors to M. D. Anderson. 
''It's beyond clubiness,'' said Richard H. Koppes, a former shareholder activist who is now a lawyer at Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue, noting that people who see one another at social events are frequently unable to criticize each other. ''These people are human,'' he said. 
Dr. Mendelsohn brushed aside criticism that he was not independent because the cancer center had received donations from Enron. Officials at the center said it had received $92,508 from the Enron Foundation and the company since Dr. Mendelsohn joined Enron's board. Mr. Lay, who resigned on Wednesday as Enron's chairman and chief executive, and the Linda and Ken Lay Family Foundation also gave M. D. Anderson $240,250 since Dr. Mendelsohn became president. 
''Some of the articles have made it sound like M. D. Anderson was very dependent on Enron philanthropy to do its work,'' Dr. Mendelsohn said. ''That's far from the case. We've gotten more than that from other companies and private donors.'' 
He added: ''During that same period we've gotten pledges and gifts of more than $233 million. Every gift is important, but our operating budget is $1.4 billion.'' 
As the president of M. D. Anderson, Dr. Mendelsohn is the public face of the institution and serves as its primary fund-raiser. This week, Dr. Mendelsohn said he spent a third of his time raising money to increase the cancer center's quality and size. 
In his role, Dr. Mendelsohn developed close ties to former President George Bush and his wife, Barbara, who lost a child to leukemia. They used their joint 75th birthday party in 1999 to raise $10.1 million for the cancer center. 
The Bushes also attended last November's benefit gala, joining 1,900 guests. A few weeks before that, George Mitchell, a Texas real estate and natural gas magnate, and his wife, Cynthia, gave M. D. Anderson $20 million to help build a $174 million basic science research building. 
And Dr. Mendelsohn has also played a prominent role in Washington, where he has advised President Bush on issues like stem-cell research and the appointment of Dr. Andrew C. von Eschenbach, the director of prostate cancer research at M. D. Anderson, as head of the National Cancer Institute. 
At the time Mr. Lay named Dr. Mendelsohn to the Enron board, he praised him as ''a visionary in the Houston medical community.'' Both men served on the board of the Greater Houston Partnership. Last year, Dr. Mendelsohn appeared with Jeffrey K. Skilling, then chief executive of Enron, at a Houston panel on the future of technology. 
It seemed like a natural alliance, Dr. Mendelsohn said, because M. D. Anderson was ''an important contributor to the well-being of Houston'' and Enron was one of the city's major companies. ''They invited me on the board to take advantage of certain experience I've had, and I was pleased to accept,'' he said. 
He was soon active in many of the board's most controversial decisions -- the approval in June and October 1999 of the partnerships with the company's chief financial officer at the time, Andrew S. Fastow, and the decision to suspend the company's own code of ethics so Mr. Fastow could serve as the general partner of the partnerships. As a member of the audit committee, Dr. Mendelsohn was also responsible for reviewing the transactions between the partnerships and Enron in February 2000 and February 2001. 
''I can't get into details about Enron, because there are a lot of matters under investigation,'' he said. 
But Dr. Mendelsohn has been criticized for not having the appropriate financial background to serve on Enron's board, especially its audit committee. Patrick McGurn, a vice president at Institutional Shareholder Services, which advises large investors on corporate governance, said that, when it comes to business, there were limits on the capabilities of even the smartest doctor. ''At a certain point in time, you are a doctor, and that's your training,'' he said. ''You're probably a businessman secondarily.'' 
As head of M. D. Anderson, Dr. Mendelsohn said he was well qualified to be an Enron director: ''I am the head of a large organization with a large budget and have had to deal with budget and growth issues. I've relied on superb business people to work with me. I haven't arranged complicated derivative deals, but I have been involved in management and growth.'' 
Dr. Mendelsohn has not been the only beneficiary of Enron at M. D. Anderson, but he is the most visible. His predecessor, Dr. Charles A. LeMaistre, 77, who was president of the cancer center for 18 years, is also an Enron director. In 1993, the Enron Foundation pledged $1.5 million to a building campaign, and the Enron Corporation Cancer Screening/Early Detection Clinic was named in honor of Dr. LeMaistre. So far, officials said, the Enron Foundation has paid $900,000 of what it promised. 
At ImClone, where he has been a director since 1998, Dr. Mendelsohn's presence has added to the company's credibility. Within medical circles, he is held in high regard. ''He is an eminent researcher and has a reputation of being an excellent leader and administrator,'' said Diana Petitti, vice chairwoman of the National Cancer Policy Board, where Dr. Mendelsohn is also a member. 
Much of the company's promise has to do with the potential of what could be a revolutionary cancer treatment, C-225, the experimental drug whose development Dr. Mendelsohn pioneered. ImClone's stock price took off when the drug seemed to work in clinical trials. The decision, in September, by Bristol-Myers Squibb to pay as much as $2 billion for a 20 percent stake in ImClone and rights to the drug, named Erbitux, seemed to confirm that optimism. 
In late December, the stock, which had peaked earlier in the month at $75.45, plunged after ImClone announced that the Food and Drug Administration had refused to even consider the company's application for permission to market the drug. Although company executives contended that the agency's only real concern was a lack of certain documentation, The Cancer Letter, a newsletter in Washington, obtained a copy of the F.D.A.'s letter to ImClone and reported that the agency's concerns had been more extensive, even as ImClone continued to assure people it was in sync with the agency. On Jan. 18, Congress announced an investigation. 
The shares, which had recovered somewhat, fell 16 percent on Friday, to $16.49, after the company said it had received inquiries from both the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Dr. Mendelsohn was among the shareholders who had cashed out a portion of their stock when Bristol bought its stake. Dr. Mendelsohn said he was told at a board meeting to sell 20 percent of his stock, the percentage Bristol was buying. He exercised options on 90,226 shares and received $6.3 million of the $149.7 million the original stockholders received from Bristol, all of whom had the option to sell some of their stock at $70 a share. His business partners, who had borrowed to invest even more heavily in ImClone, received the lion's share. 
As a scientific adviser to ImClone, Dr. Mendelsohn's role in promoting ImClone and the drug is unclear. Although his involvement added credibility in the early years, according to Jason Kantor, an analyst with J. P. Morgan, the participation of Dr. Leonard B. Saltz in the clinical trials at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan had more weight in persuading people the drug might be effective. 
Dr. Mendelsohn denied he was overly enthusiastic about the drug's promise. ''Personally, I've never done anything but describe the merits of the antibody and its results,'' he said. ''I've given lots of lectures. I stressed, and it's in print, that this is an experiment.'' 
''I get a lot of calls from people asking me, 'Should I invest? Should I invest?' '' he continued. ''I always say it's an experiment. It's well along, but until we prove to the F.D.A. that this is a satisfactory anticancer agent, it's an experiment.'' 
Dr. Mendelsohn said he had been careful to avoid any conflict of interest with ImClone. ''I give a lot of speeches,'' he said, ''and I always state that I am on the board of ImClone and I own stock in the company. I always say this.'' He said he always took note of these connections in his publications about the drug. He takes no money from the corporation for his own research, and he does not prescribe C-225 to his own patients. 
But Dr. Mendelsohn is a paid consultant to ImClone, creating what corporate governance experts view as another threat to his ability to serve as an independent director. Last year, he was paid $12,000 for his work as a scientific adviser, he said, more than the $10,000 he received as a director. He also received 30,000 stock options, which are not vested. 
And Dr. Mendelsohn serves as an adviser to other companies, including Bristol-Myers and assorted biotechnology concerns. 
Although Dr. Mendelsohn does not serve on the boards of any other companies, he is on the board of a new venture capital fund, the Scientia Health Group, which plans to invest in health-related ideas and involves ImClone's management. ''I have only a modest knowledge'' of the fund, he said, noting it had only one meeting.'' 
Dr. Mendelsohn acknowledged that the role of a director is much less appealing these days. His directorships at Enron and ImClone are taking so much of his time, he said, ''I'm probably not going to be on any other board.''

Patents
While Enron's future is uncertain, its trademarked name could live on for a decade.

ENRON'S future as a business enterprise is uncertain, but its name could live on for 10 years -- as a trademark, at least. 
Enron moved a step closer to winning a trademark for its tilted ''E'' logo last week when the United States Office of Patents and Trademarks published the company's application in the office's Official Gazette. Such publication is a routine part of the process, providing notification of pending trademarks and giving the public a chance to oppose them if a case can be made.
Trademarks are valid for 10 years, and can be renewed for 10-year periods thereafter. Five years after a trademark is granted, however, the owner must file an affidavit stating that the trademark is in use. So if Enron dissolved completely, it would be difficult for the company to maintain its trademarks or win renewals. 
In the application published last week the company requested a trademark on the stylized ''E'' in June, specifying that ''the word 'Enron' and the lower element of the letter 'E' are blue, the middle element of the letter 'E' is green, and the top element of the letter 'E' is red.'' 
Despite the company's having filed for bankruptcy in early December, Enron has so many pending trademark applications that the trademark office continued throughout December and January to churn out requests for further information, amendments and publication notices. On Jan. 15, the agency awarded a trademark to Enron for ''E Enron, Enron Field,'' a logo that refers to the Houston sports stadium and is intended to cover ''information relating to sporting events and related activities by means of a global computer network.'' 
Some of Enron's trademarks and pending trademarks appear to be better candidates for selling or transferring to another company than others. Ten days after Enron declared bankruptcy, its application for a trademark on the term ''Espeak'' was approved and another for ''Ethink'' passed a final review. A third, for ''Emeet'' was being opposed. All the trademarks were intended to cover ''an employee communication program via transmission of messages among computer users, namely, an online electronic forum for knowledge sharing, idea generation, creative problem solving and collaboration.'' Theoretically, any number of companies might be interested in taking them off Enron's hands. 
But for the moment, Enron has no plans to abandon its trademarks or pending applications. 
''I know that for now, such rights are being maintained,'' said Scott Brown, a Houston lawyer who handles Enron's trademark applications. ''One thing we're doing on the trademark side is making sure we don't lose any marks during the bankruptcy period,'' Mr. Brown said. ''I think the bankruptcy court would govern any continuing work on behalf of Enron.'' 
That might include processing applications for a number of advertising slogans, like ''One Stop Energy Shop'' and ''Puts the Energy into E-Commerce.'' Enron has also asked for trademarks on catch phrases like ''Investing Our Energy in Your Business'' and ''Click on Your Power'' for its energy management services. Some slogans -- like ''Enron Earth Smart Wind,'' for electrical power distribution -- might seem to make sense only to the people who dreamed them up. 
Other pending trademarks include ''Enron Etelligence,'' ''Enron Envest'' and ''Enron Enpower'' -- all intended to promote Enron's ''financial risk management for energy related facilities.'' 
Investors hoping to recoup money from any of Enron's remaining assets probably should not look to the company's patent portfolio. 
When Enron declared bankruptcy, it held 20 patents that had been assigned to it by various inventors. Much of the value is tied to the shelf life of those patents, and most were issued in the 1980's -- meaning they are due to expire in the next few years. The first to lapse will be patent 4,629,657 for a ''biaxially oriented polypropylene film construction for special lamination,'' which was granted in 1986 and will expire in 2004. 
Seventeen of the patents were issued between 1986 and 1990, and several of those were assigned to the Enron Chemical Company and the Enron LNG Development Corporation. The Enron Corporation was formed in 1985 with the merger of Houston Natural Gas and an Omaha company called InterNorth. The two earlier companies won 26 patents between 1976 and 1985, and Enron may have inherited some or all of those. But since they were granted 17-year terms, the last will expire this year. 
Many companies count patents as intangible assets, which generate income through licensing fees and royalties. The value, of course, derives from the fact that a patent grants exclusive rights to the holder for 17 to 20 years, depending on when it was issued. Most of Enron's patents are unlikely to have much appeal to competitors or clients because they are already too old to offer long-term exclusivity. And it is possible that many of them will expire before all the legal proceedings around Enron come to an end. 
The value of the Enron patents is also limited by the fact that they do not cover universal technologies. The two dozen inventors working on behalf of Enron conducted research in very specific areas. Only certain investors or licensees would probably be interested in a ''ship-based system for compressed natural gas transport'' (patent 5,803,005), a ''direct fuel-fired furnace arrangement for the recovery of gallium and germanium from coal fly ash'' (patent 4,643,110) or a ''method of forming a press-fitted pipe joint'' (patent 4,769,897).

ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: THE WEEK THAT WAS
A Suicide and a Resignation as the Formal Inquiries Get Under Way
By TOM REDBURN

Until Friday, the Enron affair seemed to be a scandal focused on lost money, tainted politics and misleading accounting. But then it turned tragic. 
At the end of a week of high drama in Houston and Washington, J. Clifford Baxter, a former Enron vice chairman, was found dead in his locked car not far from his home in a Houston suburb. It was ruled a suicide.
Friends and associates said that Mr. Baxter, who left the company in May, had clashed last spring with Jeffrey K. Skilling, who was Enron's chief executive at the time. 
Mr. Baxter had ''complained mightily'' about the ''inappropriateness'' of Enron's financial practices, according to Sherron S. Watkins, the whistleblower whose August letter to Kenneth L. Lay, the Enron chairman, outlining the accounting practices that ultimately brought down the company surfaced earlier this month. 
Mr. Baxter was said by friends to be distraught in recent days over his inability to end the abuses that led to the collapse of the company. 
''It makes it real,'' a neighbor of Mr. Baxter said -- ''it'' being the Enron scandal, no longer esoteric. 
THE CHAIRMAN QUITS -- Under pressure from creditors, Mr. Lay ended his long tenure as leader of the company he created and began his new career as a defendant in lawsuits, a witness before Congressional committees and a potential target of criminal investigations. 
The questions about Enron's partnerships and accounting practices confronting Mr. Lay, who is scheduled to testify before Congress on Feb. 4, hark back to the classic Watergate query: What did he know, and when did he know it? In Houston, the further question on the minds of Enron workers, and former workers, is: Why did he continue to encourage employees to buy Enron stock after he knew that doubts had been raised about the company's books? 
Mr. Lay, who used to trade birthday cards with President Bush, won't be visiting his old friend at the White House. The president, traveling in West Virginia, told reporters that he was outraged that Enron executives misled their employees and investors -- including his mother-in-law, who lost $8,096, the White House said. 
Just before Mr. Lay resigned, a former Enron employee, Maureen Castaneda, revealed that people working in the accounting unit had been shredding Enron documents for weeks. 
CONGRESSIONAL INQUIRIES BEGIN -- Two panels of lawmakers held the first of what are expected to be many hearings by the 11 subcommittees looking into Enron's failure and its implications. 
A House subcommittee released evidence suggesting that scores of people were involved in the destruction of documents at the Houston office of Enron's auditor, Arthur Andersen. Andersen officials continued to say the primary blame for the shredding belonged to David B. Duncan, the partner responsible for the Enron account. Lawmakers were skeptical of that account, but Mr. Duncan declined to testify, invoking his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Lawmakers are expected to ask questions about document destruction at Enron during hearings in early February. 
CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM ADVANCES -- The quest to ban the unlimited contributions to the political parties known as soft money was revived last week by Enron's collapse and the tales of how it spread nearly $6 million in campaign donations across Washington since 1989. More than half of the contributions were soft money. 
Advocates of overhauling the nation's campaign finance laws gained enough support to force a House vote on legislation that would make the most wide-ranging change in the law since the Watergate era. The insurgents made their move, a defeat for the House Republican leadership, on the second day of the new Congressional session, collecting the final signatures needed on a petition to send the bill to the floor. 
For all the expressions of outrage on Capitol Hill at last week's hearings, critics argued that Congress shared responsibility for Enron's demise. Of the 248 senators and members of Congress serving on the investigating committees, 212 have received campaign contributions from Enron or Arthur Andersen. In recent weeks, many politicians have scrambled to erase any financial connections to Enron. They have donated the company's contributions to charitable causes or to a fund established to assist former Enron employees. 
CONNECTIONS TO BUSH OFFICIALS -- Former Enron employees said that they had warned senior executives of evidence that a major division of the company had overstated its profits by hundreds of millions of dollars. For three years, the division's No. 2 executive was Thomas E. White, who left Enron last June to become Secretary of the Army. 
Mr. White, who owned more Enron stock than any other senior official joining the Bush administration, disclosed that he held between $25 million and $50 million in Enron stock and a like amount in stock options when he joined the administration. Mr. White, who also said he had had 30 ''personal'' contacts with Enron employees since last June, sold the shares over an extended period of time under a government ethics agreement. 
Associates of Karl Rove, President Bush's top political adviser, revealed that Mr. Rove had recommended the Republican strategist Ralph Reed to Enron for a lucrative consulting contract as Mr. Bush was weighing whether to run for president. The move was intended to keep Mr. Reed loyal to the Bush campaign, they said, without putting him on the Bush payroll. Both Mr. Reed and Mr. Rove said the Enron contract had nothing to do with the Bush campaign. 
WALL STREET'S SKINNY -- Confidential partnership records showed that Enron executives wore two hats, offering Wall Street deal makers, banks, insurance companies, and wealthy investors detailed information about Enron's inner workings and off-the-books holdings that was denied to company shareholders. With the information, Enron enticed the investors to pour cash into one of the partnerships that helped wreck the company by dangling the prospect that they could double their money in less than a year. 
Finance experts called the deal shocking, but probably legal, and said it demonstrated the unintended consequences of securities laws meant to level the market playing field, rather than tilt it toward privileged investors. TOM REDBURN

Police Probe Ex-Enron Executive's Death --- Baxter, an Apparent Suicide, Worked to Sell Assets Of Energy-Trading Firm
By Wall Street Journal staff reporters Rebecca Smith, Alexei Barrionuevo and Tom Hamburger

The former Enron Corp. executive who was found dead Friday had been engaged in the difficult task of trying to sell off assets as the company's finances started to take a turn for the worse. 
Police investigators in Sugar Land, Texas, said they are continuing their investigation into the death of former Enron Vice Chairman J. Clifford Baxter, who quit the company in May before a string of negative events became public and propelled the Houston energy company into U.S. bankruptcy court last month.
Mr. Baxter was found at 2:23 a.m. Friday morning in his 2002 black Mercedes Benz with a gunshot wound to the head. The car, which police said contained a handgun, was parked in a median about a mile from Mr. Baxter's newly built home that he shared with his wife and two children in the affluent planned community of Sugar Land, about 30 miles southwest of Houston. 
Police quickly put out a press release with the headline "Suicide," only later in the day changing it to read "Death Investigation." Following an autopsy, the Harris County Medical Examiner's office said Mr. Baxter's death was consistent with a suicide. But police spokeswoman Pat Whitty said yesterday that "in spite of the fact the medical examiner believes it's a suicide, we're still processing the car, gun, hair and fibers . . . to ensure it was a suicide." Authorities haven't released the note. 
Those who knew Mr. Baxter, who was 43 years old, expressed shock and disbelief that he should have taken his own life. A former U.S. Air Force captain and investment banker, Mr. Baxter joined Enron in 1991 and quickly became a leading dealmaker for the company, according to one person who worked closely with him. When Enron later became burdened with poorly performing assets, he was charged with helping dispose of assets, particularly ones overseas. 
In that latter role, Mr. Baxter would have been privy to a wealth of information on Enron's hundreds of partnerships and special entities, through which the company pumped up profits and kept debt off its balance sheet. People close to the matter say Mr. Baxter found it difficult to sell many of these assets and was bothered by the fact so many were worth less than their book value. 
Some of the partnerships that apparently came to his attention were ones in which other senior officers may have had an ownership interest. Federal investigators are looking into arrangements that involved Enron's former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, and possibly others, including the former corporate treasurer, Ben Glisan. 
Those who knew Mr. Baxter say he regarded himself as the "integrity guy" at Enron. His name appears in a memo written to former Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay in August by whistle-blower Sherron Watkins warning about a potential conflict-of-interest disaster that could be awaiting the company because of the partnerships. Ms. Watkins said Mr. Baxter complained "to all who would listen." 
Like others at Enron, Mr. Baxter was being sought by federal investigators who are trying to unravel Enron's complex financial arrangements. Mr. Baxter had been given legal representation, paid for by Enron, through the law firm of Swidler Berlin Shereff Friedman. 
Mr. Baxter's attorney, Michael Levy, also is representing Enron's chief accounting officer, Rick Causey. Mr. Levy declined to discuss the case but instead criticized reporters and politicians for sullying Enron's name. He said the case "can only truly be understood after months of careful and deliberative investigation. Putting this kind of media spotlight on the topic doesn't help answer those questions any faster." 
On Wednesday, Mr. Levy was contacted by investigators from the House Energy and Commerce Committee who requested an interview with Mr. Baxter. However, no interview date had been set. Earlier this month, Mr. Baxter also received a subpoena for Enron-related documents from a Senate Government Affairs subcommittee. It is unclear which, if any, documents he may have turned over to the panel. 
Just what Mr. Baxter's mental state was prior to his death is uncertain. People who knew him said he continued to work out and spent time on his 72-foot Viking yacht, the Tranquility. He continued to do community work, notably for Junior Achievement. 
Yet one friend said Mr. Baxter obviously was shaken by what happened at Enron, a company he felt he had helped build. "It wasn't unusual for Cliff to be dramatically affected by things," this person said. "That was just his way. He would obsess over details. That's why he was such a good investment banker. 
"He was trying to get some distance from the situation," this person added, "but his personality wouldn't let him." 
Mr. Baxter was seen as particularly close with former Enron Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling, who plucked the one-time PaineWebber dealmaker out of Enron's Washington, D.C., office where he worked for the natural-gas side of the company. Mr. Skilling, impressed by Mr. Baxter's talent as a negotiator, brought him to Enron's Capital and Trade Resources unit -- the engine of the company's go-go growth during the 1990s. 
Mr. Baxter left Enron to work at Koch Industries, a conglomerate with a heavy interest in energy, in 1995 for less than three months in the company's equities group, which was based in Wichita, Kan. But he returned to Enron and in 1998 was instrumental in the purchase of Portland General Electric, an Oregon utility. This was supposed to have been Enron's springboard into the Western power market, especially California, which had just been deregulated. But the plan never panned out, and Mr. Baxter soon found himself looking for a buyer for Portland General. 
On Friday, four policemen stood guard on the steps of Mr. Baxter's red brick house in Sugar Land, a town named for the cane fields it once contained. They turned away reporters seeking comment from Mrs. Baxter and family friends on hand. 
Neighbors said the Baxters kept pretty much to themselves and often were away. 
Mr. Baxter spent most weekends on his motorboat and one neighbor said the family spent most of last summer cruising the Caribbean, arriving back home just a few days before school started for Mr. Baxter's fifth-grade daughter and high-school-aged son. "When he retired, we figured we would see a lot more of him," said Tom Swonke, a next-door neighbor. "But we didn't." 
After the scandal broke, one Enron official pointed out, Mr. Baxter would sometimes chat with Mr. Skilling and others he had worked with, and they buoyed each other's spirits. But those conversations evidently became less frequent when attorneys advised senior Enron executives facing potential class-action lawsuits and criminal inquiries that they shouldn't be in contact any longer. 
One person who was close with Mr. Baxter at Enron noted he had seemed "in pretty good shape the last time I talked to him," a few days before his death. Still, this person said, Mr. Baxter had lamented of late: "This is all going to have a really bad ending."

ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: THE SUICIDE
Despite His Qualms, Scandal Engulfed Executive
By JIM YARDLEY and SHAILA K. DEWAN

The New York Times

HOUSTON, Jan. 26 -- Cliff Baxter was supposed to be on a boat right now, floating on some endless expanse of blue water beneath endless blue skies. That was the party line when he left Enron last May as vice chairman, and if former colleagues now say it was never that simple, they nonetheless expected him to be living the good life. 
The son of a police sergeant, Mr. Baxter was getting out of Enron as a rich man at a time when his vision for the company apparently clashed with those of many of its top executives. He had helped create the company's centerpiece business, its energy trading operations, and had risen to vice chairman, a grand title for a man from ordinary beginnings.
He had a loving wife and two children and a big new house in an exclusive suburb. He could afford to do anything, or nothing at all. 
But if Mr. Baxter left Enron months before trouble engulfed the company, those troubles seemed to be engulfing him when he was found dead early Friday morning, shot once in the head. An autopsy was completed on Friday, and the death has been ruled a suicide, a representative of the Harris County Medical Examiner's Office said today. 
Mr. Baxter had been subpoenaed by Congress to testify about Enron, and investigators hoped he would be a helpful witness against his former peers since his name had surfaced as someone who had complained ''mightily'' about the financial partnerships now at the center of the company's collapse. He had also been named as a defendant in a shareholder lawsuit. 
His anguish became evident to those who bumped into him in recent weeks. People who saw him at the Houston Yacht Club, where until recently Mr. Baxter kept a boat, Tranquility Base, noticed that his salt-and-pepper hair had turned mostly white between December and January, said the club's president, Chuck Buckner. 
''Cliff was a guy who clearly seemed to be very concerned that people would think ill of him whether he'd done anything wrong or not,'' said Mr. Buckner, a partner with Ernst & Young. At the club's Christmas party in December, Mr. Buckner said, he and Mr. Baxter spoke only in general terms about Enron. 
''I thought he was a man who'd got out on time, but a man who'd be concerned about what happened to the company,'' Mr. Buckner said. ''He worked really hard. This was the son of a policeman. This wasn't a rich kid.'' 
The mail carrier in the neighborhood, Veronica DeLaCruz, said that Mr. Baxter's mail had been full of certified letters from law firms in Houston and elsewhere in recent months, and that his wife regularly signed for them. But in recent weeks, as the certified letters kept coming, no one came to the door to sign. 
''They were very, very to themselves,'' said a next-door neighbor who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ''They spent most of their time on their yacht.'' 
Police investigators in Sugar Land, the affluent Houston suburb where Mr. Baxter's body was discovered inside his parked Mercedes-Benz, have refused to reveal the contents of a suicide note he left behind, but CNBC has reported that Mr. Baxter wrote that he was distraught over Enron's disintegration and the prospect of having to testify against friends there. 
His reputation among friends and colleagues was of a man of high integrity who could be an intimidating negotiator, sometimes arrogant and brash in a typically Enron mold. He liked expensive cars and motorcycles, and one former colleague, Michael P. Moran, recalled seeing a Ferrari, a Lexus, an S.U.V. and more in his parking spot. 
''He was really pretty typical of what the Enron culture was, although he was a very principled individual,'' said Mr. Moran, a retired general counsel of Enron's natural gas pipeline group who is now serving on the creditors' committee overseeing the bankruptcy. 
Mr. Moran said he was shocked by Mr. Baxter's death because he had had neither financial problems nor a major hand in the company's decline. But, he said, Mr. Baxter had always been concerned about the fate of workers when he was buying or selling companies. 
''The thought has crossed my mind,'' Mr. Moran said, that the suicide came because ''he was so disturbed by all the things that were going on.'' 
Before he left Enron, Mr. Baxter, like many of the company's executives, was active in charity work, particularly for Junior Achievement of Southeast Texas. Jerry V. Mutchler, the group's president, described him as ''very gregarious, a very big thinker and one of those people who thought you should give back.'' 
Mr. Mutchler said Mr. Baxter had raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for the group because he wanted to help make certain young people ''understood the values of the free enterprise system.'' 
Doug Leach, a vice president of Enron Global Markets, said one of Mr. Baxter's fund-raisers for Junior Achievement was called Birdies for Charity. A putting green was set up in the Enron lobby for employees who passed by. ''They would pay to make a putt, and Enron would match the funds,'' Mr. Leach said. ''He held his own as a putter. He had fun, he got into it. 
''That's the part of Cliff I got to know, and that's why this is so sad.'' 
Mr. Baxter grew up in working-class Amityville, N.Y., on the south shore of Long Island, one of six children of a father who was a local police sergeant and a mother who worked for the Town of Babylon. He graduated with honors from New York University, became a captain in the Air Force and earned a master's degree in business at Columbia University. 
Arriving at Columbia Business School as a married father recently discharged from the Air Force, Mr. Baxter did not fit the typical profile of an incoming student. 
Dan Nagao recalled that Mr. Baxter had approached him in an accounting class after noticing in the student directory that Mr. Nagao, too, had served in the military. They became friends, Mr. Nagao said, and he recalled that Mr. Baxter had joined a rock band as a guitarist, hustled fellow students in pool and joined investment and entrepreneurial clubs on campus. 
For years, Mr. Baxter and Mr. Nagao stayed in touch, talking, exchanging e-mail messages, swapping Christmas cards. Mr. Baxter talked about his two children and his wife, Carol, whom he had met while in the Air Force, but rarely about his job. Only last year, after Mr. Nagao asked Mr. Baxter what he did for Enron, did Mr. Baxter state, almost sheepishly, that he was the company's vice chairman. 
This year, though, Mr. Nagao said the usual Christmas card with the long, handwritten note and the photo of his family did not arrive from Mr. Baxter. ''It was something simple, but I remember mentioning to my wife that it was odd,'' said Mr. Nagao, who runs a human resources consulting company in Palo Alto, Calif. 
''I thought, maybe he's busy, maybe he's traveling. I was thinking of calling him, and just asking him, 'Hey, is everything O.K.?' I regret not doing that now.'' 
When Mr. Nagao learned of his friend's death on Friday, he was shocked. ''I don't know what happened, and I would hate to even guess,'' he said. ''We thought that Cliff would survive anything.''

The Astros Should Give Some of the Money Back
By GEORGE VECSEY

The New York Times

c. 2002 New York Times Company

ANY day now, the geniuses who run baseball are going to accept the court ruling that they cannot whack the Minnesota Twins this year. 
''Never mind our whining about bad teams, shaky finances, unstable future,'' they will instruct their staffs. ''Go out and hustle those season tickets.''
Selling baseball is going to be a trifle hard in Houston, since folks do not have as much money as they thought they did. Thousands of people have lost salaries, stock value and pensions because of the friendly folks from Enron. 
And anybody who can scrape together a few dollars for a ticket to an Astros game must contemplate walking into Enron Field, named for a company synonymous with pumped-up stocks and the shredding of documents. 
Who wants to go to a ballpark with a name that stinks? 
Baseball, ostensibly the American pastime, the last bastion of the cheap seat, the place where people can go and boo, is now stuck with a name that represents the dangerous friendship between rapacious business and complaisant government. 
Give it back. That was my first thought when I realized Enron had paid $100 million for 30 years to flash its name in lights across the new downtown baseball palace. 
Most emphatically, the Astros should not cut a check directly to Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's resigned chairman and chief executive. Instead, the club should put the money into an account for all the people whose life savings went down the drain after the big people sold their stock and got out, leaving the little people once again to hold the bag. 
The account might provide only quarters per family, but it would be a gesture. At the least, the Astros would not be keeping money that had been spent to glorify Kenneth L. Lay and his house of cards. 
It's blood money, really. 
Unfortunately, when I raised the question of giving back the money and the name, the Astros said they could not. 
''We don't have any options,'' said Pam Gardner, the team's president of business operations. ''We honor contracts. When you deal with bankruptcy courts, it's difficult.'' 
According to Gardner, Enron is ''current on payments'' to the club, but she said, ''We're watching the situation carefully.'' 
Apparently, the naming rights to the ballpark can be considered an asset in bankruptcy procedures. Anybody foolish enough to take over the hollow shell of an energy company, even on a penny-for-dollars basis, might be able to stick its own corporate logo on the ball park. 
Repo Stadium, sponsored by your friendly local repossession agents. That has a certain ring to it. 
In the meantime, families and charities, and hospitals and the arts are hurting because they trusted this company that blustered about its smarts and hinted broadly at close ties to power. 
''This is a very sad time in Houston,'' Gardner said. ''This has been devastating to the community.'' 
What stops the management of the Astros from deciding it does not want to be linked to this Enron fiasco? Lawyers, Gardner said. 
There is no clause in the contract allowing the team to lop off the name in case of adverse publicity and failure to say nothing of the blatant possibility of bad faith. 
''We do not have that unilateral ability,'' Gardner said. 
How smart could the Astros' lawyers be? Enron is hardly the first company to go down after making a grandiose commitment to naming rights. There is a long list of airlines, 90-day dot-com wonders, banks and other companies that put their names in lights and then tapped out, leaving behind irrelevant logos on downtown skylines. It's an epidemic. 
These failures ought to be a warning about the risks of increasing synergy among major companies. Take money from an energy company and take the chance of becoming a joke. Buy into a baseball team and suddenly you're a lodge brother to Carl Pohlad and Bud Selig and other owners who perform favors for each other and do not seem to comprehend the meaning of the phrase conflict of interest. 
Come to think of it, having a naming-rights nightmare in Houston just might fit into the grand poor-mouth strategy of Commissioner Selig and his merry band: ''See, we told you so. Baseball really is in a terrible way.'' 
Maybe the Astros' owners are legally stuck with the name while Congress and the courts and maybe even the feds look into the scandal. But I propose a course of passive resistance. 
The Astros should eliminate the copious use of that disgraced name all over its promotions and brochures. Order new cocktail napkins with no Enron Field on them. Tell the public-address announcer to never utter that name again. Play hardball. Do the bare minimum. Don't insult people who were impoverished by flim-flam executives and their docile accountants. 
Come to think of it: if an energy company can fail, so can electricity itself. The Enron signs should develop a serious short circuit. What's Enron going to do, sue? Any lawyers they can afford are surely busy on more important fronts. 
The Astros may not be able to dismantle the sign just yet, but at least the club should cut the power on a shameful name. And when the time comes, the club should donate some money to people who were harmed by Enron.

Planet Of the Privileged
By MAUREEN DOWD

Oh, the pull of Planet Enron. 
The atmosphere there was so rarefied that its inhabitants were blissfully oblivious to how privileged they were.
It was a lovely place, sort of like Aspen with oil rigs. The skiing was great because there was always a pristine powder of newly shredded financial records on the slopes. 
There was offshore drilling off every shore and offshore subsidiaries on every corner. 
A red flag fluttered on Planet Enron, but nobody paid attention. 
Journalists in Washington were hunting for Dick Cheney for months, even as he was completely visible and accessible on Planet Enron, where he lumbered down golden boulevards. 
Phil and Wendy Gramm, the king and queen of the Enron prom, cruised around in their white stretch limo, rewarded for years of service, exempting and deregulating. 
Paul O'Neill was also ubiquitous there, his face emblazoned and his words enshrined on the currency, which begins with $1,000 bills. The motto: ''Companies come and go. It's part of the genius of capitalism.'' 
Mr. O'Neill was not Treasury secretary up there, though, merely a private citizen. Kenneth Lay, still smarting that the president decided not to name him Treasury secretary on Earth, anointed himself with the title on Enron. 
The Bushes summered there, and W. and Jeb dropped by when they needed campaign cash. But lately, they began putting brown paper bags over their heads when they visited so no one would notice them hobnobbing with Kenny Boy. 
Everyone was upwardly mobile on Planet Enron, a world more consumed with havens than have-not's. 
There were, blessedly, no lower classes or riffraff. Denizens were blue blood or blue chip but never blue. There were the born rich, and there were the new rich the born rich made rich. The congenitally rich create the crony rich by ushering them onto the boards and payrolls of oil and energy companies and defense contractors. 
There was no conflict of interest on Planet Enron, only confluence of interest. No income tax, only insider tips. No S.E.C. or G.A.O., just C.E.O.'s, S.U.V.'s and N.O.B.D.'s (not our bankruptcy, dear). Q.E.D. 
All meetings on Planet Enron were held in secret, and everyone liked it that way. Auditing was considered rude. It was a very empathetic place. 
On Planet Enron, it seemed only fair that chairman-for-life Kenneth Lay should reward himself with $51 trillion in a severance package, as opposed to the $51 million he was seeking on Planet Earth. 
On Planet Enron, Secretary of the Army Thomas White could whine that he came out with only $12 million from sales of the company's stock. He bravely said he ''would persevere.'' 
On Planet Enron, Karl Rove could expect people to mist up at the poignant tale of how he made mere millions instead of more millions when government ethics rules forced him to sell all of his stocks. And he could ingratiate himself with the conservative leader Ralph Reed by offering him a piece of the Enron rock. 
On Planet Enron, the president, his words muffled by the brown paper bag on his head, could strike a chord complaining that his mother-in-law had lost $8,000 on Enron stock when less connected mortals lost their entire retirements. 
It was a beautifully sheltered place (and not just in the Caymans sense). A place where inhabitants deluded themselves that their accomplishments and windfalls -- Ivy League degrees, energy company sinecures, lucrative consulting contracts, advisory board booty -- were the result of merit and hard work. 
But then turmoil struck. The planet has been overrun by the Wrong Kind: government lawyers bearing subpoenas and grand juries poking around. The thin and tony air has become noxious with the threat of litigation and incarceration. 
Dick Cheney is still there, but he's hiding in a secure location. Now he has caves on two planets. 
President Bush, distancing himself by light-years, has ordered the U.S. government to look into cutting off all business with the planet. 
On Friday, the once-serene orb imploded with the news of the sad death of a leading citizen, who shot himself in his Mercedes after telling friends he did not want to have to turn against his own. 
But Planet Enron is bigger than one company or one tragedy. It's a state of mind, a subculture, a platinum card aristocracy. Its gravitational pull has long proven irresistible.

I Am Woman, Hear Me Roar in the Enron Scandal
By JILL ABRAMSON

The New York Times
Page 3, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

WASHINGTON -- AS the klieg lights went up on the Enron hearings, many of the familiar elements of Washington scandal were on display -- charges of influence peddling, expressions of shock from outraged lawmakers and wall-to-wall lawyers in dark suits. 
But there was one novelty. Enron, unlike so many other Capitol messes, features powerful women in starring roles in a scandal that, at least so far, has nothing to do with sex.
Nancy Temple, the Arthur Andersen lawyer and a leadoff witness, could even emerge as a fall gal. She was raked over the coals by her House inquisitors for sending directives that they believe Andersen employees construed as an invitation to shred thousands of Enron financial documents. Ms. Temple, who sent her memos at a time when she knew the company could be sued for Enron's mounting accounting problems, denied wrongdoing. 
Two women are vying for the part of the heroic whistle-blower. There is Sherron S. Watkins, the Enron executive whose memo warning the chairman, Kenneth L. Lay, that their company might ''implode in a wave of accounting scandals'' helped rocket the ruckus. 
Maureen Castaneda, a former Enron executive, last week went public with allegations of large-scale document shredding at Enron and provided actual proof. She had taken some of the shreds home to use as packing material, only to discover that they were marked with the names Chewco and Jedi, two of Enron's legally questionable partnerships. 
Both women held fancy titles. Ms. Watkins was Enron's vice president for corporate development. Ms. Castaneda was director of foreign exchange and sovereign risk management. 
In recent days, investigators from the Securities and Exchange Commission have been talking with Martha P. Stuart about the role played by her law firm, Kirkland & Ellis, in helping to set up some of the partnerships at the center of the inquiries. 
The highest-profile women to figure in past Washington scandals, the White House intern Monica Lewinsky and the law professor Anita Hill, became famous because they were in the middle of controversies involving charges of sexual misconduct. Both women were in relatively low-level government jobs at the time of their fateful tangles with much more powerful men, President Bill Clinton and Clarence Thomas, then a Supreme Court nominee. 
Other women have been featured players in nonsexual scandals, but they didn't occupy positions near or in the executive suite. Iran-contra's Fawn Hall was a White House secretary. So too, was Watergate's Rose Mary Woods, President Richard Nixon's loyal employee, who was responsible for the famous 18.5-minute gap on a crucial White House tape. (She said her foot accidentally hit the delete pedal as she was busily transcribing.) 
Watergate did feature a professional woman, an ITT lobbyist named Dita Beard, in a bit part, but she missed a bigger role when she went to the hospital in order to avoid testifying before Congress about a memo she wrote. 
Other supporting female scandal players have included the wives of officials under fire, like Martha Mitchell, or subordinate aides, like Deborah Gore Dean, a lieutenant to Housing and Urban Development Secretary Samuel Pierce, who was prosecuted for her role in an influence peddling scandal in the 1980's. 
''The scandal glass ceiling seems to have been broken,'' declared Ellen Miller, a senior fellow at The American Prospect, a liberal magazine, who was an outspoken critic of campaign finance abuses during various fund-raising scandals in the Clinton years. Is this progress? ''The story has changed. It's not about sex. It's about women as major players in powerful positions.'' 
In the Clinton years, a few cracks appeared in that glass ceiling. Three high-powered lawyers found themselves on the hot seat: Hillary Rodham Clinton for her Rose Law Firm connections in Whitewater, and Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood, whose nominations for attorney general fell apart in what became known as Nannygate. 
But Mrs. Clinton fell under scrutiny because of whom she was married to, and the problem that beset Ms. Baird and caused the White House to drop support for Ms. Wood flowed from their domestic lives, not their professional work. 
SUZANNE GARMENT, the author of ''Scandal: The Culture of Mistrust in American Politics'' (Random House, 1991) is not sure the development is a healthy one. 
''It is very interesting that women have reached the point when they can be at the center of scandal because of financial reasons instead of sexual reasons,'' she observed. 
''But insofar as you think women have historically had a superior morality to that of men, then it isn't a cause for celebration.'' 
Whether cause for celebration or worry, the change does reflect the rising status of women in the legal and corporate worlds. They are now high enough on the ladder to drive the action, as Ms. Temple may have done when she instructed Andersen employees on the company's policy concerning the retention (or destruction) of documents. 
They are close enough to the corridors of power to hear secrets and technically proficient enough to figure out what is going on, as Ms. Watkins did as she decoded Enron's impenetrable accounting (she had been an executive at Andersen before joining Enron). 
They may not consider themselves bona fide members of the club of top corporate officials, however. 
For example, while Ms. Temple did testify before a House subcommittee on oversight and investigations, David Duncan, who was the lead Andersen partner on the Enron audit team, refused to answer questions and invoked the Fifth Amendment. 
Ms. Temple may have less to hide -- or she may have felt less bound by the corporate world's brotherhood of silence.

I was shocked and disgusted but somehow not surprised by a detail of Kenneth Lay's compensation structure nearly buried at the end of the story of his resignation (Jan. 24). You reported that Lay had a credit line of $7.5 million from Enron, meaning he could borrow that much from the firm at any given time for his personal use. He took advantage of this arrangement multiple times last summer, and then would repay the loan with his Enron stock, only to take advantage of the credit line once again. 
All this was happening in the months just prior to his famous September speech exhorting his employees to buy the "undervalued" stock. Then Enron announced its worst quarter ever. Finally, I understand Lay's motives--they were in his own best interests. Of course.

Now that Lay has resigned as chairman of Enron, maybe the Bush administration can hire its old buddy as a consultant on privatizing Social Security. All that talent shouldn't go to waste.

For an instant take on how 2001 treated investors, all you had to do was flick on your TV. Gone were the frenetic performance-touting spots of years past. In their place: dour Schwab ads in which founder Charles admonishes a mock town meeting of gray-clad investors, "You have to take the ups with the downs." 
Signs of new stock market sobriety were everywhere this year: CNBC viewership tumbled, ten rate cuts by Greenspan & Co. still couldn't stave off a recession, and highly paid analysts were not only stripped of celebrity status but also sued by investors (Mary Meeker) or humbled into accepting buyout packages (Henry Blodget). By early December the Nasdaq was down 17% for the year, the Dow had fallen 6%, and the S&P was off by 12%.
Then again, "there are so many scenarios you could have written that would have been so much worse," points out Roy Weitz, editor of FundAlarm.com. In fact, since the unprecedented four-day market shutdown and subsequent slide after the Sept. 11 attacks, the Dow has rebounded 13%. Given the year we've had--what with events like the Enron implosion, the Bass brothers' massive margin call, and the uproar over a giant diaphragm in Denver (read on for an explanation)- -it's entirely possible that the last few weeks of 2001 will bring even more surprises. Let's hope at least some of them are happy ones. 
S&P 500 standout: J.C. Penney led the pack for most of 2001 but late in the year was eclipsed by Nvidia, which makes graphics chips for Microsoft's Xbox, among other things. The company got an extra boost when it inherited Enron's spot on the S&P 500 and index fund managers raced to buy the stock. Gain for the year: 225%. 
S&P 500 laggard: Lending can be a risky business, especially if your niche is hawking credit cards to people with spotty credit histories just as the economy heads into a tailspin. Such was the fate of Providian Financial, which lost a full 95% of its value amid a spectacular run of credit card defaults. 
Best way to cash out: Selling your stake in a company you built is never easy, but if you're Tom Bailey, the company is Janus, and you have a "look back" provision in your contract allowing you to unload your shares at the 2000 price, which reaps $603 million--well, it tugs at the heartstrings a little less. 
Worst way to cash out: Margin calls are always ugly, but rarely quite as big--or as publicized--as the late-September fiasco in which longtime Disney shareholders Sid and Lee Bass (and their dad, Perry) were forced to sell 135 million shares for around $2 billion. It gets worse: Their shares fetched only $15 each in a private deal; Disney stock now trades for $22. 
Best fund: In a year marked by--at best--middling performances, the small-cap Schroder Ultra gained a stellar 62% by keeping lots of cash on hand (around 40%), using put options, and shorting stocks (like a hedge fund). The only drawback? The fund is closed to new investors. 
Best reason to manage your own money: Fund manager James McCall of the Merrill Lynch Focus Twenty. Merrill waged a bitter legal battle to lure the then-hot momentum manager from Pilgrim Baxter two years ago. It's no doubt regretting that decision now: McCall got his walking papers in November after the Focus fund, which held tech, telecom, and Enron, lost 70%. 
Worst reason to manage your own money: You may be a step ahead of McCall, but hanging on to your day job is probably a good idea, judging from the performance of so-called market-participation funds. At the IPS iFund, where shareholders nominate stock picks on a Website, collective wisdom precipitated a 37% decline for the year. The StockJungle.com Community Intelligence Fund, for its part, was put out of its misery in August after losing about 36%. 
Most awkward PR flub: When Denver fund company Invesco agreed to pay $120 million over 20 years to slap its name on the Broncos stadium, it was no doubt angling for good press. So when a Denver Post columnist wrote that Invesco's own employees had dubbed it the "Diaphragm," it had to hurt. Invesco threatened to sue but let up when it discovered that some staffers really did think the stadium bore a striking likeness to a gigantic birth-control device. 
Hottest IPO: Let's just say 2001 wasn't exactly an ideal year to take your company public. September, in fact, had the distinction of being the first month since 1975 in which there were no IPOs whatsoever. Yet there were a few success stories, including the best performer (from the date the company went public to present): a Mountain View, Calif., company called Verisity, which makes software to detect flaws in electronic systems. Since its March IPO, the stock has doubled. 
Should've stayed private: Bringing up the rear in the IPO brigade was Seattle sandwich maker Briazz: Rattled working people shunned its pricey gourmet sandwiches, and investors lost their appetite as well- -the stock is down 88% since the IPO in May. 
Nastiest boardroom battle: The acrimonious drama had more twists, turns, and 1980s-style backbiting than an episode of Dallas, but in the end Computer Associates founder and chairman Charles Wang triumphed over Texas investor Sam Wyly (who proposed a rival slate of directors, charging that Computer Associates had floundered under Wang's stewardship). 
Biggest boardroom upset: Lone shareholder Guy Adams got so fed up with Lone Star Steakhouse management that he ran against CEO Jamie Coulter for his board seat. Unbelievably, he won--by a reported 2.3 million votes. 
Most embarrassing Enron call: There was lots of competition here: bad calls, late calls, and gutless calls by analysts (not to mention the conference call in which CEO Jeffrey Skilling labeled one money manager an a--hole), but special distinction goes to Ron Barone of UBS Warburg, who lowered his rating on the stock from a strong buy to a hold--on Nov. 28, just days before Enron declared bankruptcy. Uh, thanks. 
Best makeover: The urge to merge raged this year as fund companies attempted to save face by folding hideous specialty funds into slightly less hideous tech funds. Strong Internet was merged into the Strong Technology 100 fund, and Merrill Lynch Internet Strategies was bled into the Merrill Lynch Global Technology fund. But proving yet again that it really is what's on the inside that counts, the Strong fund has so far lost 39%, and the Merrill fund is down 42%. 
Greatest career gamble: With a middling investing record on his resume, James Oberweis, dairy magnate and founder of the eponymous asset-management firm, announced he would vie for a U.S. Senate seat in Illinois. Perhaps in light of the markets' turbulence, anything looks easier than facing the Nasdaq. 
Best prediction for 2002: Finally, we wondered what investors could look forward to next year. Fund watchdog Weitz predicts that mutual fund marketing gurus are already dreaming up a spate of "new reality" funds filled with defense and biotech stocks. Not the most tasteful proposition, perhaps, but given this year's exploits, probably not far off the mark. Let's just hope it doesn't land them in the loser's circle next year.

1. 9.11 That the World Trade Center attacks could leave New York City $100 billion in the red seems oddly beside the point. They destroyed thousands of lives and livelihoods, shattered our nation's sense of security, and plunged us into war. 
2. The Recession With the market melting down, consumer confidence evaporating, and joblessness rising, not even Alan Greenspan's ten rate cuts--and another expected this month--could stave off recession. At least you lived to see the biggest boom ever. Now wave bye-bye.
3. The Enron Implosion Thanks to the energy trader's dubious bookkeeping, Ken Lay went from running a $101 billion company to presiding over the biggest bankruptcy in history. 
4. California's Energy Crisis As energy became scarce, the state instituted rolling blackouts and spent $11 billion to bail out PG&E and SoCal Edison. While conservation stabilized soaring prices, the crisis--plus the Enron collapse--left the deregulation movement in tatters. 
5. Wall Street Analysts Henry Blodget and Mary Meeker were the poster children for Wall Street hype. But this was the year investors, burned by analysts' stock picks, stopped believing and started suing and booing. 
6. Team Bush No one expected much from the President and his advisors on foreign policy. The focus was supposed to be domestic policy, like the tax cut. Sept. 11 turned that around. Bush has emerged as a strong war leader, but his legacy could still depend upon reviving the economy. 
7. Telecom Meltdown If you think this Lucent office looks empty, ask one of the company's employees about his 401(k). The entire industry suffered stupefying losses thanks to bad investments and wishful thinking. 
8. China Being selected to host the 2008 Summer Olympics wasn't the country's only big win. After years of tense negotiation, China gained entry to the World Trade Organization. 
9. Microsoft Why is Bill Gates smiling? Maybe because his Teflon tech firm slipped a Justice Department noose, shook an avalanche of bad press, launched the XP operating system, and unveiled the coveted Xbox game console. 
10.Ford Chairman Bill Ford ousted bare-knuckled CEO Jacques Nasser after a year of nightmarish PR, pricey foreign investments that left the company scrounging for cash, and lawsuits that ended the nearly century-old relationship between Ford and Firestone. The scion has a tough road ahead.

Dear Santa, 
I can't believe it's that time of year again. I hope this letter finds you in the best of health. I think I speak for everybody when I tell you that we've been very, very good this time around, so this is going to be a rather long list. Grab something wet, pull up a Barcalounger, and pay attention.
At the outset, let me say I consider it a miracle that this letter reached you at all. I figure you have security up the wazoo, what with all the wackos sending stuff through the snail mail. That whole drill has to make your job a lot tougher. Be patient, Santa, and don't cut corners. Don't get complacent. There's more than one evildoer who would love to take the blush out of the cheeks of a symbol of Western hedonism like you. But don't worry about this letter, of course! If there's any white powder on the envelope, it came from one of the freshly baked doughnuts I have waiting on the mantle for your upcoming visit! 
Anyhow, this year it's clear that many, many people are a lot more needy than I am, so in the spirit of the season I'm gonna ask for their presents first. 
I should start, I guess, with the poor folks at Andersen, the accounting and consulting firm. Boy, Santa, do those guys need some new calculators! Please get a whole bunch for them. They approved the books for the fellows over at Enron, whose earnings didn't turn out to really be what they said they were at first. Then they had to restate them. Was their collective face red! I'm sure if the Andersen people had better equipment, they wouldn't have screwed up like that with Enron, or with all the other corporations they seemingly permitted to wank around with their numbers in exchange for hefty consulting fees. 
While we're at it, I suppose we can't ignore the senior management that used to run Enron either. What a bunch of boneheads! But this is the holiday time of year, Santa, the season of forgiveness and giving, so why not make their executive homes your first stop? They need a lot, Santa. To start with, they're gonna want, like, thousands of hours of legal time from expensive firms, so give them that. And why not throw in a couple of files they can bake into cakes for later on? 
On your way out of town, forget about toys and games and stuff like that and just please leave a ton of money under the tree of every Enron employee, particularly the fired ones, and of course the older ones who thought they were going to have something to retire on. And as for the financial planners who allowed employees' 401(k)s to hold solely the company's stock, I suppose you should bring very special presents for them too...I can't think of what, though...How about we let the Enron work force figure that one out? 
There are so many business executives to think about this year too. Most of them you could make happy with fractional growth in Ebitda for the quarter. That would be a huge surprise, and you know how much executives like pleasant surprises! 
Bill Gates? You don't need to bring anything for him, Santa. He has just about everything, you know, and what he doesn't have, he can certainly take over and repackage as part of his operating system. But I guess you should try to make sure that there's an Xbox under every American child's tree this year, and a couple of games too, particularly the one where those buff girls in tiny Spandex outfits throw each other around. Just knowing he was making so many children happy would bring a seasonal smile to Bill's Microface. 
Oh. Make a very special trip to Carly Fiorina too. She's the woman who runs Hewlett-Packard, you know. She worked so hard this year and had so much aggravation, Santa, so...could you please make Walter Hewlett go away? He's the son of the founder, and he's being a real party pooper! He thinks that the merger is bad for a lot of stupid reasons...like something about how it will draw the company away from its core competencies in printing and focus it on the low-margin computer-manufacturing side of the business, but when you get right down to it, he's simply being a bummer, that's all. Please, Santa. Bring Carly her merger. She's staked her whole reputation--and her bonus next year--on the outcome, and, you know, any CEO who is willing to risk compensation on something must want it really, really bad. 
While you're at it, please bring John Chambers, the head of Cisco, a good stock price right away. The poor fellow has six million options riding on it. Four million of them are underwater, but more recently the company gave him two million more at a strike price of $18.50, and they should be worth something, don't you think? If you don't, Mr. Chambers will really feel that $268,131 he gave up in salary to show he knows that corporations should pay for performance and nothing less. 
Gee, this is getting kind of long, and I haven't even gotten to myself yet! So, just briefly, bring Alan Greenspan something nice but healthy, Santa--very, very healthy, no cigars or liquor. Vitamins! Yeah! And let's see...oh, yes, bring the Internet some genuine advertising revenue, will you? It could really use it. And don't forget to leave the folks over at the New York Times business section some Prozac. Or Viagra, maybe. Anything to cheer them up. 
For myself, now...well, I guess I have just about everything a man could want, so I'll just mention a few of the things I could do without. Bring me no cutbacks in my stocking, Santa, for me or my friends, and no smallpox, and no anthrax, and no particular reasons to travel anywhere by plane, at least for a while. And most of all please do not bring a suitcase with a nuclear weapon in it for anybody I know, and even the people I don't. Other than that, I could always use a new car. Anything will do, as long as the top goes down. And a phone even tinier than the one I have, to show I'm getting more powerful. And hey, keep this global warming going on. It's great! 
Now get busy, my man! You're gonna need plenty of time before takeoff this year, you know, to interview all the reindeer twice after conducting extensive background checks on all of them, especially Rudolph, whose nose always looked a little red to me, and to X-ray all those packages, no matter how small they might be, while making sure nothing has been placed in the baggage compartments underneath your sleigh by the grinches who want to steal a whole lot more than Christmas. Fly safe, Santa! We need you more than ever this year! 
Oh--and while you're over Iraq, if you happen to spot a suspicious factory or laboratory of any sort, don't forget to pop a nice little present down its chimney, from--and for--all of us. 
Feliz Navidad, baby!

Features/The Credit Watchers
The Geeks Who Rule The World ; There's a reason Moody's and S&P have been doing so well. Their customers can't say no.

On Nov. 28, when Standard & Poor's and then Moody's downgraded Enron's debt below the all-important status "investment grade," the company's bankruptcy became a foregone conclusion. The downgrades confirmed that Enron would no longer be able to support its trading operations by accessing the capital markets, and they triggered the repayment of billions of dollars of debt. 
But the one-two credit punches pointed not just to a TKO of Enron. They were also a reminder of the immense and seemingly ever- increasing power of the agencies themselves. A much-coveted triple-A rating (the highest grade) is the grease in an otherwise squeaky engine. It makes every aspect of doing business easier, from raising money to convincing customers that operations are solid. In contrast, an S&P or Moody's downgrade is a fearsome event that can dramatically increase a company's cost of capital, perhaps even destroy its ability to raise money. As one critic put it decades ago, they retain an "almost biblical authority."
That's because the rating agencies--private, for-profit companies that are privy to insider information--have come to play a quasi- regulatory role in the market. Many big investors, from pension funds to insur-ance companies to money market funds, are prohibited from owning more than a set amount of lower-rated debt, for instance. 
But while the Enron debacle is evidence of the agencies' power, it also brings some long-simmering criticism--think back to 1975, when the agencies failed to downgrade New York City's debt until the city's fiscal crisis was obvious--to a frothy boil. Critics say that the credit czars, for all their inside access, didn't identify this borrower's woes any earlier than the rest of us did--and they didn't downgrade the debt even after the severity of the problems was well known. Indeed, prior to the downgrades, Enron's debt was trading at around 50 cents on the dollar, a sign that the market had already dismissed the company's investment-grade status as farce. "The rating agencies are always late," grouses one portfolio manager. 
Of course, neither John Rutherfurd, the CEO of Moody's, nor Leo O'Neill, S&P's president, see things that way. "We communicated our view [that Enron's rating was dependent on its merger with Dynegy] clearly and frequently," says O'Neill. Adds Rutherford: "We do not want to rush to judgment nor do we delay in informing investors when we believe fundamentals have changed." 
How can the same entities be all-powerful and strangely after-the- fact at the same time? That is one of the more puzzling conundrums in today's capital markets. The nearly regulatory function of the agencies and the weight their opinions carry make their judgments critical--but also complicated. The agencies can be not just observers but active participants in the course of events. That's because a downgrade can become a self-fulfilling prophecy: If the rating agencies act too rashly, they could be accused of causing a bankruptcy. Yet if they deliberate too long, they'll simply be stating what everyone already knows--especially since today, unlike in the '70s, there is an army of outside fixed-income analysts that both challenge the rating agencies' judgments and profit from anticipating their actions. 
True, this debate rarely reaches Enron-esque proportions. And it's worth emphasizing that corporate debt is just a small part of these agencies' purviews. They analyze almost every fixed-income instrument out there, from the debt of China to the complex bonds backed by cash flows from, say, the Mississippi tobacco settlement. Their power, in fact, is very much entwined with that omnipresence. Moody's alone claims that it rates more than $30 trillion of the world's debt from over 100 countries, 4,200 corporations, and 68,000 public finance obligations. 
What's more, the agencies appear, in the wide lens of history, to be fairly accurate in their judgments: As both O'Neill and Rutherfurd note, it's rare that investment- grade credits go kaput. Both agencies have statistics showing that less than 1% of bonds rated A- or better default over a five-year period. In addition, around 85% of the credits in the domestic A class still hold the rating at year- end, implying stability in higher-rated bonds. 
But by its sheer size the Enron implosion challenges that perception of stability. And it draws attention to the agencies at a particularly interesting time--for Moody's especially. Until recently the actual businesses of Moody's and S&P were hidden away inside much larger companies. S&P is still buried within McGraw-Hill. But in October 2000, Dun & Bradstreet spun Moody's out as a separate company. For the first time ever, outsiders can perform a credit check on a rating agency. 
Combing through Moody's financials makes one thing perfectly clear: Credit rating is a fabulous business. Since its spinoff, Moody's stock has climbed--yes, climbed--some 40%, giving Moody's the same market value as Bear Stearns. This year the rating agency is expected to generate about $770 million in revenues (less than a tenth of Bear's revenues) and an astounding $382 million in operating income. And Moody's does this with just 1,600 employees. Perhaps it's not surprising that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is the company's largest shareholder, owning just about 15% of the stock. Henry Berghoef of Harris Associates, another large Moody's holder, says that the biggest challenge facing CEO Rutherfurd is the proper management of the company's immense free cash flow. Rutherfurd himself, a scholarly, white-haired 62-year-old, has few complaints. "It's a big thrill," he says. 
Indeed, what's not to like? For one thing, Moody's potential customers almost can't say no. As Merrill analyst Joanne Park wrote in a recent report, "In many cases, a Moody's rating is practically a prerequisite for coming to market with a new issue of fixed-income securities." Like an investment bank, Moody's is a big beneficiary of the long-term growth in the capital markets--without even having to risk its own capital. Kevin Gruneich, an analyst at Bear Stearns, calculates that over the past 20 years Moody's revenue and profits grew at compound annual rates of 16% and 15%, respectively--a growth trend he terms "incredible." (Rutherfurd adds that in the past 20 years, profits have fallen only once, in 1994.) In recent years Moody's has stabilized its revenue still further, basically creating an annuity stream by instituting what it calls "relationship pricing." Instead of hiring Moody's on a transactional basis, some of its customers now pay an annual fee; in return, Moody's rates every bond issue they do. "Relationship pricing" now accounts for 36% of Moody's revenues. 
Both Moody's and S&P have also done a remarkable job of keeping pace with innovations in the capital markets. Witness the explosion of a new type of debt known as "structured finance"--a bond, for instance, backed by the cash flow from residential mortgages. Here the rating is everything: It measures the level of risk in an extremely complicated security and determines the yield that must be paid to attract investors. "The rating agencies play an integral role in distributing paper into the marketplace," says Kevin Rigby, head of Deutsche Bank's rating advisory business, which helps Deutsche's clients argue their cases to the rating agencies. (In yet another indication of the agencies' power, many of the major investment banks have entire departments that do this.) Structured finance is now Moody's largest business, accounting for one-third of its revenues, up from almost nothing in the late 1980s. 
As Moody's pushes aggressively into new markets, it has expanded its power base as well. Rutherfurd is especially excited about Europe, which currently accounts for about 20% of the company's sales. He notes happily that there are about 1,500 unrated companies with revenues greater than one billion euros. "Money coming out of banking and into the capital markets should propel growth in ratings for the next decade," he says, quickly adding, "But we love banks too." Indeed. Recently the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision proposed that ratings be used globally to determine banks' capital adequacy. (The proposal seems to be on hold for now.) 
This is certainly not a state of affairs that John Moody would have imagined when he began providing statistics on railroad bonds back in 1909. In the beginning it was all very simple: Investors paid for Moody's research, which helped disseminate important information to the market. Some two decades later the government was mandating that banks use ratings to determine the values of their investment portfolios. Then, in the second half of the century, the SEC began to rely on ratings to determine what sort of securities insurance companies, pension plans, broker-dealers, and money market funds could own. Both Moody's and S&P resisted those developments for a number of reasons--but they didn't say no. "I don't think that ratings should be used to determine investment policy," O'Neill maintains today; Moody's has written a number of letters protesting the use of ratings in regulatory policy. 
Another substantial change occurred around 1970. Prior to that time Moody's and S&P had always earned their keep from investor subscriptions. Given the growing volume of work, however, those economics no longer made sense. So first Moody's and then S&P began to charge issuers instead. There's a constant worry that this poses a conflict of interest. But unlike equity analysts, the credit analysts don't have to worry about buying business with favorable ratings. Companies simply don't have a lot of choice. 
The most controversial development came in 1975 when the SEC, worried that fly-by-night rating agencies could wreak havoc on the market, initiated a mouthful of a designation, the "nationally recognized statistical rating organization," or NSRSO. To comply with various SEC regulations, a company's rating had to come from an NSRSO- -essentially, Moody's, S&P, or Fitch, a smaller competitor that is a subsidiary of French concern Fimalac. The designation has become the subject of intense debate. "The SEC has enveloped [the agencies] in a very protective webbing that keeps anyone else from challenging them," says Lawrence White, an economics professor at NYU. "There they are, a 2 1/2-firm industry, sitting pretty." But no one has a better idea. Says Rick Roberts, a former SEC commissioner who is now an attorney at Thelen Reid & Priest: "It's a very uncomfortable situation, but it's impractical to take out what is already there." 
There have been other complaints about the clout the agencies have- -Moody's in particular. In the early 1990s allegations began to swirl that Moody's bullied municipalities into hiring it by issuing unsolicited (and negative) ratings to those that declined the offer. One Colorado school district sued the rater after it made negative comments about a pending bond sale, claiming that investors used the pan to demand a higher interest rate, resulting in a net loss of $769,000. The court ruled that Moody's ratings were opinions, not facts--and therefore the company was protected under the First Amendment. 
But that hardly settles the broader issue: In the capital markets the ratings can function as facts even if they aren't. That's because of the numerous regulations that are built around them. The Continental Divide is between investment-grade securities and non- investment-grade securities, because many investors, like pension funds and insurance companies, are permitted to own only a certain quantity of lower-quality bonds. And many money market funds are allowed to have just 5% of their assets in commercial paper that doesn't carry a top rating. So when Moody's and S&P downgraded Ford Motor's debt in October, Gary Zeltzer, head of investment-grade fixed income at J.W. Seligman, had no choice but to sell. (While Ford's debt sold off on the downgrade, it now trades at a better price than it did before.) 
And that brings us back to the Enron question: How much should credit ratings anticipate the verdict of the stock market? O'Neill insists that his firm cannot afford to rush to judgment; it doesn't bother him at all, he says, if a bond trades at a different level than its rating implies: "The market tends to be much more near-term focused. We need to be diligent and make sure we do our work." Richard Waugh, an analyst at the Principal Financial Group, agrees. "What [the agencies] do moves markets and affects the flow of capital. So they have to make very sure that they're right, and they lean over backward to accomplish that." 
But Moody's Rutherfurd has a different point of view. "If a credit is deteriorating, we want to be the first to spot it," he says. He jumps up to an easel, looking very professorial, to talk about the "Merton model"--basically, a way of incorporating the judgment of the equity market into ratings. In his view, that's important, because the equity market is forward-looking, whereas accounting data are reflective of the past. "We think we're way ahead of S&P in doing this," he boasts. Nor does Rutherfurd seem to bristle at the recent criticism. "I hate the word 'optimal,' " he says. "But we do the best we can, and we think it's pretty good." 
That "pretty good" is likely to be as good as it gets--barring a few more Enron-caliber events, the credit-rating system isn't likely to change. As First Union analyst Asa Graves says of Moody's, "They would have to really shoot themselves in the foot to lose serious market position."

"Our business is not a black box. It's very simple to model. People who raise questions are people who have not gone through it in detail. We have explicit answers, but people want to throw rocks at us." 
So said Enron's then-CEO, Jeff Skilling, in an interview I had with him last February. At the time--less than ten months ago, let's recall--Enron's market capitalization was around $60 billion, just a shade below its all-time high, and its status as a Wall Street darling had not yet begun to crumble. I was working on a story that would ultimately raise questions about Enron's valuation, and I'd called with what I considered fairly standard queries in an effort to understand its nearly incomprehensible financial statements. The response from Enron was anything but standard. Skilling quickly became frustrated, said that the line of inquiry was "unethical," and hung up the phone. A short time later Enron spokesperson Mark Palmer called and offered to come to FORTUNE's New York City office with then-CFO Andy Fastow and investor-relations head Mark Koenig. "We want to make sure we've answered your questions completely and accurately," he said.
Now, in the wake of Enron's stunning collapse, it looks as if the company's critics didn't throw enough rocks. The world is clamoring for those "explicit answers," but Skilling, long gone from Enron-- and avoiding the press on the advice of his lawyers--is in no position to provide them. As for "completely and accurately," many would argue that the men running Enron never understood either concept. "One way to hide a log is to put it in the woods," says Michigan Democrat John Dingell, who is calling for a congressional investigation. "What we're looking at here is an example of superbly complex financial reports. They didn't have to lie. All they had to do was to obfuscate it with sheer complexity--although they probably lied too." 
Until recently Enron would kick and scream at the notion that its business or financial statements were complicated; its attitude, expressed with barely concealed disdain, was that anyone who couldn't understand its business just didn't "get it." Many Wall Street analysts who followed the company were content to go along. Bulls, including David Fleischer of Goldman Sachs, admitted that they had to take the company's word on its numbers--but it wasn't a problem, you see, because Enron delivered what the Street most cared about: smoothly growing earnings. Of course, now that it's clear that those earnings weren't what they appeared, the new cliche is that Enron's business was incredibly complicated--perhaps even too complicated for founder Ken Lay to understand (something Lay has implied since retaking the CEO title from Skilling last summer). Which leads to a basic question: Why were so many people willing to believe in something that so few actually understood? 
Of course, since the Enron collapse, there are other basic questions as well--questions for which there are still no adequate answers. Even today, with creditors wrangling over Enron's skeletal remains while the company tries desperately to find a backer willing to keep its trading operations in business, outsiders still don't know what went wrong. Neither do Enron's employees, many of whom expressed complete shock as their world cratered. Was Enron's ultimate collapse caused by a crisis of confidence in an otherwise solid company? Or were the sleazy financial dealings that precipitated that crisis--including mysterious off-balance-sheet partnerships run by Enron executives--the company's method of covering up even deeper issues in an effort to keep the stock price rising? And then there's the question that's been swirling around the business community and in Enron's hometown of Houston: Given the extent to which financial chicanery appears to have take place, is someone going to jail? 
A CULTURE OF ARROGANCE 
If you believe the old saying that "those whom the gods would destroy they first make proud," perhaps this saga isn't so surprising. "Arrogant" is the word everyone uses to describe Enron. It was an attitude epitomized by the banner in Enron's lobby: THE WORLD'S LEADING COMPANY. There was the company's powerful belief that older, stodgier competitors had no chance against the sleek, modern Enron juggernaut. "These big companies will topple over from their own weight," Skilling said last year, referring to old-economy behemoths like Exxon Mobil. A few years ago at a conference of utility executives, "Skilling told all the folks he was going to eat their lunch," recalls Southern Co. executive Dwight Evans. ("People find that amusing today," adds Evans.) Or how about Skilling's insistence last winter that the company's stock--then about $80 a share--should sell for $126 a share? Jim Alexander, the former CFO of Enron Global Power & Pipelines, which was spun off in 1994, once worked at Drexel Burnham Lambert and sees similarities. "The common theme is hubris, an overweening pride, which led people to believe they can handle increasingly exotic risk without danger." 
To be sure, for a long time it seemed as though Enron had much to be arrogant about. The company, which Ken Lay helped create in 1985 from the merger of two gas pipelines, really was a pioneer in trading natural gas and electricity. It really did build new markets for the trading of, say, weather futures. For six years running, it was voted Most Innovative among FORTUNE's Most Admired Companies. Led by Skilling, who had joined the company in 1990 from consulting firm McKinsey (he succeeded Lay as CEO in February 2001), Enron operated under the belief that it could commoditize and monetize anything, from electrons to advertising space. By the end of the decade, Enron, which had once made its money from hard assets like pipelines, generated more than 80% of its earnings from a vaguer business known as "wholesale energy operations and services." From 1998 to 2000, Enron's revenues shot from $31 billion to more than $100 billion, making it the seventh-largest company on the FORTUNE 500. And in early 2000, just as broadband was becoming a buzzword worth billions in market value, Enron announced plans to trade that too. 
But that culture had a negative side beyond the inbred arrogance. Greed was evident, even in the early days. "More than anywhere else, they talked about how much money we would make," says someone who worked for Skilling. Compensation plans often seemed oriented toward enriching executives rather than generating profits for shareholders. For instance, in Enron's energy services division, which managed the energy needs of large companies like Eli Lilly, executives were compensated based on a market valuation formula that relied on internal estimates. As a result, says one former executive, there was pressure to, in effect, inflate the value of the contracts--even though it had no impact on the actual cash that was generated. 
Because Enron believed it was leading a revolution, it encouraged flouting the rules. There was constant gossip that this rule breaking extended to executives' personal lives--rumors of sexual high jinks in the executive ranks ran rampant. Enron also developed a reputation for ruthlessness, both external and internal. Skilling is usually credited with creating a system of forced rankings for employees, in which those rated in the bottom 20% would leave the company. Thus, employees attempted to crush not just outsiders but each other. "Enron was built to maximize value by maximizing the individual parts," says an executive at a competing energy firm. Enron traders, he adds, were afraid to go to the bathroom because the guy sitting next to them might use information off their screen to trade against them. And because delivering bad news had career-wrecking potential, problems got papered over--especially, says one former employee, in the trading operation. "People perpetuated this myth that there were never any mistakes. It was astounding to me." 
TRADING SECRETS 
"We're not a trading company," said Fastow during that February visit. "We are not in the business of making money by speculating." He also pointed out that over the past five years, Enron had reported 20 straight quarters of increasing income. "There's not a trading company in the world that has that kind of consistency," he said. "That's the check at the end of the day." 
In fact, it's next to impossible to find someone outside Enron who agrees with Fastow's contention. "They were not an energy company that used trading as a part of their strategy, but a company that traded for trading's sake," says Austin Ramzy, research director of Principal Capital Income Investors. "Enron is dominated by pure trading," says one competitor. Indeed, Enron had a reputation for taking more risk than other companies, especially in longer-term contracts, in which there is far less liquidity. "Enron swung for the fences," says another trader. And it's no secret that among non- investment banks, Enron was an active and extremely aggressive player in complex financial instruments such as credit derivatives. Because Enron didn't have as strong a balance sheet as the investment banks that dominate that world, it had to offer better prices to get business. "Funky" is a word that is used to describe its trades. 
But there's an obvious explanation for why Enron didn't want to disclose the extent to which it was a trading company. For Enron, it was all about the price of the stock, and trading companies, with their inherently volatile earnings, simply aren't rewarded with rich valuations. Look at Goldman Sachs: One of the best trading outfits in the world, its stock rarely sells for more than 20 times earnings, vs. the 70 or so multiple that Enron shares commanded at their peak. You'll never hear Goldman's management predicting the precise amount it will earn next year--yet Enron's management predicted earnings practically to the penny. The odd mismatch between what Enron's management said and what others say isn't just an academic debate. The question goes to the heart of Enron's valuation, which was based on its ability to generate predictable earnings. 
Why didn't that disconnect seem to matter? Because like Enron's management, investors cared only about the stock price too. And as long as Enron posted the earnings it promised (and talked up big ideas like broadband), the stock price was supposed to keep on rising- -as, indeed, it did for a while. Institutions like Janus, Fidelity, and Alliance Capital piled in. Of course, earnings growth isn't the entire explanation for Wall Street's attitude. There were also the enormous investment-banking fees Enron generated. Nor was asking questions easy. Wall Streeters find it hard to admit that they don't understand something. And Skilling was notoriously short with those who didn't immediately concur with the Enron world-view. "If you didn't act like a light bulb came on pretty quick, Skilling would dismiss you," says one portfolio manager. "They had Wall Street beaten into submission," he adds. 
WHERE ARE THE PROFITS? 
Although it's hard to pinpoint the exact moment the tide began to turn against Enron, it's not hard to find the person who first said that the emperor had no clothes. In early 2001, Jim Chanos, who runs Kynikos Associates, a highly regarded firm that specializes in short- selling, said publicly what now seems obvious: No one could explain how Enron actually made money. Chanos also pointed out that while Enron's business seemed to resemble nothing so much as a hedge fund-- "a giant hedge fund sitting on top of a pipeline," in the memorable words of Doug Millett, Kynikos' chief operating officer--it simply didn't make very much money. Enron's operating margin had plunged from around 5% in early 2000 to under 2% by early 2001, and its return on invested capital hovered at 7%--a figure that does not include Enron's off-balance-sheet debt, which, as we now know, was substantial. "I wouldn't put my money in a hedge fund earning a 7% return," scoffed Chanos, who also pointed out that Skilling was aggressively selling shares--hardly the behavior of someone who believed his $80 stock was really worth $126. 
Not only was Enron surprisingly unprofitable, but its cash flow from operations seemed to bear little relationship to reported earnings. Because much of Enron's business was booked on a "mark to market" basis, in which a company estimates the fair value of a contract and runs quarterly fluctuations through the income statement, reported earnings didn't correspond to the actual cash coming in the door. That isn't necessarily bad--as long as the cash shows up at some point. But over time Enron's operations seemed to consume a lot of cash; on-balance-sheet debt climbed from $3.5 billion in 1996 to $13 billion at last report. 
Skilling and Fastow had a simple explanation for Enron's low returns. The "distorting factor," in Fastow's words, was Enron's huge investments in international pipelines and plants reaching from India to Brazil. Skilling told analysts that Enron was shedding those underperforming old-line assets as quickly as it could and that the returns in Enron's newer businesses were much, much higher. It's undeniable that Enron did make a number of big, bad bets on overseas projects--in fact, India and Brazil are two good examples. But in truth, no one on the outside (and few people inside Enron) can independently measure how profitable--or more to the point, how consistently profitable--Enron's trading operations really were. A former employee says that Skilling and his circle refused to detail the return on capital that the trading business generated, instead pointing to reported earnings, just as Fastow did. By the late 1990s much of Enron's asset portfolio had been lumped in with its trading operations for reporting purposes. Chanos noted that Enron was selling those assets and booking them as recurring revenue. In addition, Enron took equity stakes in all kinds of companies and included results from those investments in the figures it reported. 
Chanos was also the first person to pay attention to the infamous partnerships. In poring over Enron documents, he took note of an odd and opaque mention of transactions that Enron and other "Entities" had done with a "Related Party" that was run by "a senior officer of Enron." Not only was it impossible to understand what that meant, but it also raised a conflict-of-interest issue, given that an Enron senior executive--CFO Fastow, as it turns out--ran the "Related Party" entities. These, we now know, refer to the LJM partnerships. 
When it came to the "Related Party" transactions, Enron didn't even pretend to be willing to answer questions. Back in February, Fastow (who at the time didn't admit his involvement) said that the details were "confidential" because Enron "didn't want information to get into the market." Then he explained that the partnerships were used for "unbundling and reassembling" the various components of a contract. "We strip out price risk, we strip out interest rate risk, we strip out all the risks," he said. "What's left may not be something that we want." The obvious question is, Why would anyone else want whatever was left either? But perhaps that didn't matter, because the partnerships were supported with Enron stock--which, you remember, wasn't supposed to decline in value. 
SKILLING SENDS A SIGNAL 
By mid-August enough questions had been raised about Enron's credibility that the stock had begun falling; it had dropped from $80 at the beginning of the year to the low 40s. And then came what should have been the clearest signal yet of serious problems: Jeff Skilling's shocking announcement that he was leaving the company. Though Skilling never gave a plausible reason for his departure, Enron dismissed any suggestion that his departure was related to possible problems with the company. Now, however, there are those who speculate that Skilling knew the falling stock price would wreak havoc on the partnerships--and cause their exposure. "He saw what was coming, and he didn't have the emotional fortitude to deal with it," says a former employee. 
What's astonishing is that even in the face of this dramatic--and largely inexplicable--event, people were still willing to take Enron at its word. Ken Lay, who stepped back into his former role as CEO, retained immense credibility on Wall Street and with Enron's older employees, who gave him a standing ovation at a meeting announcing his return. He said there were no "accounting issues, trading issues, or reserve issues" at Enron, and people believed him. Lay promised to restore Enron's credibility by improving its disclosure practices, which he finally admitted had been less than adequate. 
Did Lay have any idea of what he was talking about? Or was he as clueless as Enron's shareholders? Most people believe the latter. But even when Lay clearly did know an important piece of information, he seemed to be more inclined to bury it, Enron-style, than to divulge it. After all, Enron's now infamous Oct. 16 press release--the one that really marked the beginning of the end, in which it announced a $618 million loss but failed to mention that it had written down shareholders' equity by a stunning $1.2 billion--went out under Lay's watch. And Lay failed to mention a critical fact on the subsequent conference call: that Moody's was considering a downgrade of Enron's debt. (Although Skilling said last February that Enron's off-balance- sheet debt was "non-recourse" to Enron, it turns out that that wasn't quite true either. Under certain circumstances, including a downgrade of Enron's on-balance-sheet debt below investment grade, Enron could be forced to repay it.) 
Indeed, facing a now nearly constant barrage of criticism, Enron seemed to retreat further and further from Lay's promises of full disclosure. The rather vague reason that Enron first gave for that huge reduction in shareholders' equity was the "early termination" of the LJM partnerships. That was far from enough to satisfy investors, especially as the Wall Street Journal began to ferret out pieces of information related to the partnerships, including the fact that Fastow had been paid millions for his role at the LJMs. As recently as Oct. 23, Lay insisted that Enron had access to cash, that the business was "performing very well," and that Fastow was a standup guy who was being unnecessarily smeared. The very next day Enron announced that Fastow would take a leave of absence. 
We now know, of course, that Enron's dealings with its various related parties had a huge impact on the earnings it reported. On Nov. 8, an eye-popping document told investors that Enron was restating its earnings for the past 4 3/4 years because "three unconsolidated entities should have been consolidated in the financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles." The restatement reduced earnings by almost $600 million, or about 15%, and contained a warning that Enron could still find "additional or different information." 
And sophisticated investors who have scrutinized the list of selected transactions between Enron and its various partnerships are still left with more questions than answers. The speculation is that the partnerships were used to even out Enron's earnings. Which leads to another set of questions: If Enron had ceased its game playing and come completely clean, would the company have survived? Or did Enron fail to come clean precisely because the real story would have been even more scandalous? 
THE LAST GASP 
On the surface, the facts that led to Enron's Dec. 2 bankruptcy filing are quite straightforward. For a few weeks it looked as if Dynegy (which had long prided itself on being the anti-Enron) would bail out its flailing rival by injecting it with an immediate $1.5 billion in cash, secured by an option on Enron's key pipeline, Northern Natural Gas, and then purchasing all of Enron for roughly $10 billion (not including debt). But by Nov. 28 the deal had fallen apart. On that day Standard & Poor's downgraded Enron's debt below investment grade, triggering the immediate repayment of almost $4 billion in off-balance-sheet debt--which Enron couldn't pay. 
But even this denouement comes with its own set of plot twists. Both companies are suing each other: Enron claims that Dynegy wrongfully terminated the deal, "consistently took advantage of Enron's precarious state to further its own business goals," and as a result has no right to Enron's Northern Natural pipeline. Dynegy calls Enron's suit "one more example of Enron's failure to take responsibility for its demise." No one can predict how the suits will pan out, but one irony is clear: Enron, that new-economy superstar, is battling to hang on to its very old-economy pipeline. 
To hear Dynegy tell it, a central rationale for abandoning the deal was what might be called the mystery of the missing cash. General counsel Ken Randolph says that Dynegy expected Enron to have some $3 billion in cash--but an Enron filing revealed just over $1 billion. "We went back to Enron and we asked, 'Where did the cash go? Where did the cash go?' " says CEO Chuck Watson. "Perhaps their core business was not as strong as they had led us to believe," speculates Randolph. Dynegy also claims that Enron tried to keep secrets to the last. Enron's lack of cash was revealed to the world in a filing on the afternoon of Monday, Nov. 19. Watson says he got the document only a few hours earlier--but that Lay had a copy on Friday. "I was not happy," says Watson. "It's not good form to surprise your partner." 
Sagas like this one inevitably wind up in the courts--and Enron's is no exception. Given that credit-rating agency Fitch estimates that even senior unsecured-debt holders will get only 20% to 40% of their money back, the battles among Enron's various creditors are likely to be fierce. Nor has Enron itself conceded yet. The company's biggest lenders, J.P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup, have extended $1.5 billion of "debtor in possession" financing to Enron, which will enable it to continue to operate at least for a while. And Enron is still searching for a bank that will back it in restarting its trading business. 
In the meantime, the courts will also be trying to answer a key question: Who should pay? Enron's Chapter 11 filing automatically freezes all suits against the company itself while the bankruptcy is resolved. But while Enron may seek the same protection for its executives, lawyers predict that the attempt will fail and that the individuals will have to fend off a raft of suits. Some think that criminal charges are a possibility for former executives like Skilling and Fastow. But such cases require proof of "knowing, willful, intentional misconduct," says well-known defense attorney Ira Sorkin. And a criminal case requires a much higher standard of proof than a civil case: proof beyond a reasonable doubt rather than a preponderance of the evidence. That's a high bar, especially since Enron executives will probably claim that they had Enron's auditor, Arthur Andersen, approving their every move. With Enron in bankruptcy, Arthur Andersen is now the deepest available pocket, and the shareholder suits are already piling up. 
In any conversation about Enron, the comparison with Long-Term Capital Management invariably crops up. In some ways, it looks as if the cost of the Enron debacle is far less than that of LTCM--far less than anyone would have thought possible, in fact (see next story). But in other ways the cost is far greater. Enron was a public company with employees and shareholders who counted on management, the board, and the auditors to protect them. That's why one senior Wall Streeter says of the Enron saga, "It disgusts me, and it frightens me." And that's why, regardless of how the litigation plays out, it feels as though a crime has been committed.

Maybe Enron's downfall shouldn't have come as such a big surprise after all. In September the bankrupt energy concern paid $10,000 to sponsor this sculpture as part of CowParade Houston 2001, the latest iteration of the fundraiser-cum-public-art-project. The cow--called Moost Imoovative and created by Jason C. Alkire--sat in front of Enron headquarters through early November. In retrospect it could be seen as a warning: The bovine, like its sponsor, is a house of mirrors, reflecting the viewer but offering no insight into its content. On Dec. 6 the cow was sold at a charity auction for $8,000. Heck, is the whole company even worth that much?

Features/The Recovery
Will The Economy Get Well Soon? ; The Fed has been slashing rates with a vengeance, but a credit squeeze could really hurt the recovery.

When it comes to recessions, economists believe in a simple rule of thumb: Pump money and credit into an ailing economy, and before long you have a recovery. The bigger the injection, the stronger the rebound. So between Alan Greenspan's yearlong campaign to slash interest rates and the government's latest stimulus package, totaling $75 billion, we should get one mind-blowing recovery, right? After all, the last time we pumped so much money into the economy was in the early 1960s, and things turned out pretty groovy back then. 
Unfortunately, it may not be so simple this time. Eight months into this recession, consumers are still buying big-ticket items like cars and homes. While that has kept the economy from totally tanking, it leaves little pent-up consumer demand to drive a fast recovery. So it's all up to corporate America--which, you'll recall, got us into this mess in the first place. As Mark Zandi, chief economist of Economy.com, puts it, "The difference between a strong recovery and a disappointing one will depend on business investment."
And on that score, there's cause for concern, if not outright agita. Most worrying are early signs of a credit squeeze as banks tighten up on corporate lending. If that continues, the recovery may not be right around the corner, as many economists are now predicting- -or if it is, it won't feel like much of one. Here's what's going on. 
Since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, many banks have turned hypercautious. According to the Federal Reserve's survey of senior loan officers, the most comprehensive picture of banks' willingness to lend, 51% of domestic banks restricted their lending in October, up from 40% in August. Foreign banks became just as wary, and the tougher credit conditions are affecting firms of all sizes across the country. "We've become more conservative in our lending," admits George Andrews, president of Capitol City Bank & Trust in Atlanta. "We're turning down customers we would have lent to a year ago." 
Banks are making it tougher for business to borrow in other ways too. According to the same Fed survey, more than half of domestic banks in October raised the rate they charge on riskier corporate loans. At the same time, a growing number of banks have imposed more stringent loan covenants and collateral requirements on large and medium-sized companies. All this took place even as the Fed was slashing short-term interest rates to stimulate business investment. Indeed, as we'll see later, what should be one of the best times ever to borrow money isn't turning out that way at all for most companies. There's one notable exception--large, well-known firms have taken advantage of a bonanza in the corporate bond market--yet here, too, that borrowing window seems to be closing as the market for commercial paper, for example, has dried up. 
So what's making banks so jittery? Blame Osama. Jay Sidhu, CEO of Sovereign Bank in Pennsylvania, says Sept. 11 introduced a lot more uncertainty for corporate earnings, leading banks to worry about the quality of loans. "Suddenly a firm that expected sales of X was not going to achieve that, and it made us more cautious," he explains. "I think the majority of banks reacted in the same way." Now Sidhu is looking for tangible improvement in the economy before he's willing to lend freely. In particular, he's closely watching consumer confidence, employment, and investment in technology for signs of a sustained rebound. 
Once Sidhu becomes less squeamish, other bankers probably won't be far behind. "Bankers are herdlike in their behavior," says Zandi. "They've trained in the same way, go to the same conferences, and talk to one another, so when one bank makes a change, the others follow." The trouble is, even when banks become more optimistic, there's a lag effect before easier credit benefits the economy. Researchers at the New York Fed have found that it can take at least three months from the time banks increase the availability of credit to when firms spend the funds. 
So how bad could it get? Think back to the last time banks lost their nerve--the early 1990s. Although it's hard to remember anything negative happening at all during the 1990s nirvana, we did experience a full-blown credit crunch at the start of the decade. That's the reason the recovery from the 1990-91 recession felt so lackluster. In fact, the media dubbed it the "jobless recovery" because firms simply couldn't get the funds they needed from banks to expand operations and hire more staff. At the time, remember, banks were saddled with bad loans following a commercial property bust. Happily, that's not the case today. "Right now we don't have anything like the real estate crisis of the late '80s," says Richard Berner, Morgan Stanley's chief U.S. economist. "It's not about a problem with capital but with confidence." Still, another corporate collapse a la Enron, and banks might find their capital base isn't as strong as they thought. That's one of the things about economic slumps. Loan quality can deteriorate virtually overnight. 
While we may well avoid a Grade A credit crunch this recession, it's clear we won't return to the days of easy money that financed the boom of the '90s anytime soon. The main reason is that the conditions for business investment aren't nearly as ideal as they were in the 1990s. As the recovery got under way back then, Washington was reducing the federal budget deficit, which brought long-term interest rates down steadily. Today we face the opposite situation. The surplus has vanished, and the prospect of mounting deficits is fast becoming reality. That's one reason long-term interest rates have hardly budged this year although official short- term rates plunged from 6.5% to 2%. Since Greenspan started cutting rates in January, 30-year bond yields have edged down from 5.5% to a mere 5.35%, and ten-year yields went from 5.31% to 5%. 
While the talk on Wall Street is all about recovery, with markets staging a dramatic rally since their post-Sept. 11 lows, the business environment remains grim--profit margins are at 19-year lows, there's excess capacity at every turn, and aggressive price discounting is rampant. Not exactly the best combination to encourage firms to invest now, is it? And that's reflected in the latest figures, which show that the steep decline in business investment that began a year ago is continuing today. Real business spending on plant and equipment dropped 11.9% in the third quarter, and new orders for capital goods in November suggest a further sharp drop for the fourth quarter. "Both leading indicators and current conditions point to further declines in capital spending," says Prudential economist Richard Rippe. "We're expecting next year to be just as weak on an annual basis." 
So are we looking at a replay of the jobless recovery? One discouraging sign: The unemployment rate climbed to 5.7% in November, up from 5.4% the previous month. But that doesn't mean all is lost. After all, the anemic recovery at the start of the 1990s was followed by some pretty good times.

Enron Fallout: Wide, But Not Deep ; Enron's collapse has hurt big American banks. But not as much as a default by Argentina would.

In a bland suburban office park 30 minutes north of Atlanta, life after Enron is taking shape. It's a show of creative destruction that would make philosopher Joseph Schumpeter proud. Only a few months ago, the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) was battling Enron for a slice of the online energy market. Now ICE and its CEO, Jeff Sprecher, are struggling to handle a flood of new business, as former Enron clients search for other ways to trade electricity and natural gas. Sprecher has airlifted in servers from around the country; his tech team is working 24/7 to accommodate trading volume of $2.5 billion a day--a 100% increase in two weeks. ICE's volumes climbed steadily all through November, as Enron's customers ebbed away. But now, says Sprecher, "by any measure, our business is going through the roof. Enron opened the door, and I walked through." 
ICE's success at profiting from Enron's failure illustrates just how quickly the market has moved to absorb the demise of America's seventh-largest corporation. It's not that people aren't hurting: Thousands of Enron workers are unemployed, and investors face billions of dollars in losses. Still, not a single light flickered after Enron's implosion, which had almost no impact on volatile energy prices. "It's like a great ship going down--there's a big splash, but the sea quickly fills in," says John Rowe, co-CEO of Exelon, the nation's ninth-largest utility. "The short-term effect is really not that substantial."
Among energy companies that traded with Enron, potential losses range from $100 million for Duke to $80 million for Mirant and $75 million for Dynegy. Among banks, J.P. Morgan Chase recently announced that it had $500 million in unsecured loan and derivative exposure to Enron; analysts say Citigroup could face a similar loss. Those numbers sound large, but they're unlikely to cause more than a crimp in earnings. "The fallout is a mile wide and an inch deep," says Jim Hanbury, a bank analyst with Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein. "One of the very good things about being a big company is that when bad things happen, it doesn't kill you." Indeed, the potential default of Argentina--a story pushed off the front pages by Enron--could actually pose a more serious threat to America's money-center banks. 
Large banks are further cushioned from Enron's failure because of the way loans are syndicated. "Literally thousands of institutions get a piece," says Hanbury--from smaller banks and Wall Street firms to insurance companies and hedge funds. That dilutes the impact of any one failure. Goldman Sachs' Richard Strauss says Enron's collapse could trim Citigroup's earnings by five cents a share, but he still expects Citi to earn $3.25 a share in 2002. He predicts J.P. Morgan will take a slightly bigger hit--15 cents a share--equivalent to a 4% reduction in earnings next year. Strauss is similarly sanguine about the impact on Wall Street. "Wall Street has had time to react, so I think the exposure of major firms is pretty minimal," he says. "Unlike Long-Term Capital's collapse or Russia's failure in 1998, people had a chance to unwind their trading positions this time." 
The fallout is likely to be felt most keenly within the energy industry itself, especially among companies that, like Enron, had moved aggressively to profit from trading and marketing electricity and natural gas. On Wall Street and in the boardrooms of energy towns like Houston and Atlanta, there's a fierce debate over whether Enron's flaws were unique. The major surviving energy traders-- including American Electric Power, Duke, Dynegy, Mirant, and Reliant- -argue that unlike Enron, they possess major physical assets like power plants and storage facilities that balance the risks inherent in trading. 
Ironically, just a year ago those companies emphasized their trading prowess; today the spin is that trading is merely a way to maximize the value of hard assets. "Our business model is fundamentally different from Enron's," says Dynegy President Steve Bergstrom. "We don't do nearly the volume of trading Enron did, and we also produce power and control natural gas. Enron had gotten out of the energy business and was essentially a financial services company that happened to make markets in electricity and natural gas." Even so, Dynegy faces more risk than its competitors. For starters, says CSFB analyst Curt Launer, Dynegy derives more of its earnings and cash flow from marketing and trading than do companies that are more akin to traditional utilities. In addition, Enron is suing Dynegy for $10 billion as a result of the failed merger. Although the suit has little chance of succeeding, any adverse legal decisions would immediately push Dynegy's stock price down. On the other hand, says Launer, Dynegy's shares have more upside potential if and when the energy sector comes back into favor. 
Mirant's CFO Ray Hill is especially eager to put some daylight between his company and Enron. "We have $22 billion in assets and 15,000 megawatts of generating power across the country," he says. "One wall of our trading floor shows the status of every plant, and almost all our trading is driven by our own assets. So if I sell power forward six months or a year, I can produce it if I need to." In addition, says Hill, Mirant's internal controls bar traders from putting more than $75 million of capital at risk each day. That's a small fraction of Mirant's shareholder equity, currently $4.7 billion, or its annual profits, projected to be nearly $700 million in 2001. "At the end of every day, the CEO and I both get a report showing exactly how much capital is at risk," Hill says. 
Still, executives from Mirant and other companies are taking great pains to tell investors just how their businesses work. Last month Mirant CEO Marce Fuller spent an hour and a half taking analysts in Atlanta and New York through each line of Mirant's balance sheet. "This isn't a topic that would have been included in an analysts' meeting in the past, but there's going to be a lot more pressure on companies like ourselves to help people understand how we make money," says Fuller. Duke Energy's group president of energy services, Harvey Padewer, agrees: "We've been very open with the Street. No one ever considered Duke a black box." 
It will be a while before energy trading companies--even those with substantial assets--regain the trust they had before the Enron debacle. Fuller says that while Mirant has already signed several profitable deals to sell gas for former Enron clients, getting fresh capital to build new power plants or make acquisitions is much harder than it was six months ago. That has caused Mirant to slow capital expenditures and delay some new investments. "There's still a lot of nervousness that something else is out there," admits Fuller. "Larger, sophisticated players with real assets like Mirant, Dynegy, and Reliant will do just fine. But the capital markets think if Enron can go down, who else has problems?"

Fearless reporting has taken senior writer Pattie Sellers to many strange but rewarding places. Name a topic, ideally something grand, hard to pin down, and yet compulsively interesting, and Pattie's written about it--Ego, Charisma, Failure, Power. (In fact, that's usually how it works; Pattie walks into my office, says something like, "How about a story on 'Revenge'?" and she's off.) What makes these high-wire acts work is that Pattie is a dogged reporter. She never settles for five examples when she can get nine, she's comfortable with numbers, and she's a people person with a knack for getting folks to open up. Which means she's a great writer of company stories as well as concept stories. Latest example: her piece on Coca- Cola, "Who's in Charge Here?" It's got everything: a great brand struggling to restore its luster, a CEO who never expected to have the top job, an ambitious heir apparent who appears more than ready to claim it, off-stage power brokers, plus lots of history, corporate culture, and insight on the beverage biz. Classic Coke meets Classic Sellers. 
Bond guys have more fun. At least they did this year. Despite the stock market's stunning post-Sept. 11 rally, returns on bonds outpaced the S&P 500 by 22 percentage points for 2001. In addition, a record year for global bond underwriting has reordered (for now) Wall Street's pecking order and left the boring bond guys rich enough to do stuff formerly reserved for the IPO underwriting crowd--like spending an average worker's annual wages on a night's wine tab. You'll learn all this and more in our lead First piece, "The Revenge of the Nerds." Written by editor-at-large Justin Fox, it's a fine example of how we approach economics and markets: Look for surprising and important insights, then deliver them with style, wit, and clarity. In that same vein, check out Cait Murphy's column on the real roots of terrorism, and Anna Bernasek's feature story on what may yet temper the coming recovery.
What's incredible, despite all the ink that's been spilled on the spectacular fall of Enron, is how much is still unclear. What did founder Ken Lay know about the company's funky accounting and off- balance-sheet machinations, and when did he know it? Why exactly did ex-CEO Jeff Skilling split in August? How leveraged was Enron--and did its vaunted trading operations ever make decent money? Truth is, we don't have all the answers yet, and neither do our competitors. But one thing's for certain: When FORTUNE senior writer Bethany McLean stood up last February and pointed out that the Emperors of Energy Trading had no clothes--or were at least wearing some rather tattered duds--(that's her piece, "Is Enron Overpriced?" at right) she was the first journalist to do so. I also know this: Her cover story, "Why Enron Went Bust," is the deepest and clearest account yet of how things came unhinged. 
Can't we get this terrible year behind us? At FORTUNE, we know how you feel. So we've decided to declare 2001 over as of mid-December. After all, we're pretty confident nothing's going to come along to change our top stories of the year--the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks (No. 1), the recession (No. 2), and Enron (No. 3). So we're delivering in this issue a preemptive package on the year that was, including our tally of the best and worst in business. Directed by assistant managing editor Jim Impoco, it captures in stunning images, fine writing by Bill Powell and Andy Serwer, and lots of short, snappy bouquets and brickbats, the tragedy, comedy, and occasional triumph of 2001. Now here's to a better 2002.

Smucker, of Orrville, Ohio, agreed to buy Jif, the No. 1 peanut butter brand, from Procter & Gamble for $1 billion in stock (P&G threw in Crisco to grease the way).

Worst: HP and Compaq It's bold (the new Hewlett-Packard would be the No. 1 player in servers and PCs). It's big (it would be an $87 billion company). But is it beautiful? Some important shareholders don't think so--namely, Hewlett and Packard. The sons of the co- founders have blasted the proposed $23 billion acquisition of rival Compaq for months. We can see why: Revenues won't grow until 2003, and the much hyped $2.5 billion in cost savings won't be realized until 2004. "We can pull this off," insists HP CEO Carly Fiorina. Maybe--but with seven operating systems and five processors to sort through, the details will be devilish.

Worst: DotCom Divas Elizabeth Carlassare's collection of case studies profiling sisters doin' it for themselves with IPOs and new distribution channels would have felt "last year" last year. Apparently neither Carlassare nor the nearly two dozen visionaries celebrated in the book saw the dot-bomb coming. Right, Candice Carpenter? 
Business movie 
Best: Startup.com Ambition, betrayal, shattered friendships, and broken hearts--now, that is what business is really all about! An insightful documentary chronicling the rise and fall of the nascent dot-com GovWorks, the film perfectly captured what it was like to be in the trenches during the late, great Net boom. 
Worst: Antitrust Sure, Tim Robbins made a decent Bill Gates body double, but the MGM-backed movie's hackneyed plot about a megalomaniacal software titan intent on dominating the world's communications networks through a conspiracy of theft and murder needed serious debugging. For a real antitrust thriller, try the court transcripts of U.S. v. Microsoft. 
Dresser 
Best: Bernard Arnault He earned his nickname--the "Pope of Fashion"--for the immense power he holds as CEO of French luxury juggernaut LVMH. But it applies equally well to his appearance. With brands like Louis Vuitton and Thomas Pink in his stable, the French billionaire always has something stunningly smart to wear. The key to looking cool, though, is never getting ruffled. Case in point: After losing a two-year battle for control of Gucci in September, Arnault turned around in November and completed a deal to acquire Donna Karan. Looking good! 
Worst: Steve Ballmer Clothes haven't made this man. In the Microsoft CEO's closet, the ex-jock and computer-geek worlds collide, and the result isn't pretty. Hey, Steve, "bespoke" isn't a command in Basic! You'd think $15 billion could at least buy him a decent iron. But with the antitrust case (mostly) behind him, XP on the market, and the Xbox ready to go under a bunch of Christmas trees, maybe he figures disheveled is in the eye of the beholder. 
Marketing campaign 
Best: Volkswagen People the world over are now on the lookout for colorful Beetles--"Hey, there's a blue one!"--thanks to Volkswagen's stylish print and TV ads. The company was named advertiser of the year by The Gunn Report, a publication that tracks global advertising awards. VW's ads aren't just fun to look at--they're effective too. The company sold more cars in the U.S. this year than at any time since 1973. 
Worst: Sony Pictures Film critic David Manning, of Connecticut's Ridgefield Press, loved Hollow Man. He raved about A Knight's Tale. And he called The Animal a winner. Too bad Manning didn't exist. A couple of Sony Pictures execs invented the man and his blurbs in order to hype Sony flicks. Two thumbs down. 
E-mail 
Best: Ted Waitt "Hi. That's right. It's me. I'm back." With that simple message to Gateway's employees, the beloved 38-year-old PC company founder (above) announced his return as CEO after a yearlong absence. Some straight talk from their cowboy-boot-wearing, ponytailed leader boosted workers after months of watching profits (the company lost $94 million in the first quarter) and the stock price plunge. Too bad investors have yet to share the enthusiasm. 
Worst: Neal Patterson Enraged to see the corporate parking lot of Kansas City health-care software company Cerner empty at 7:30 one March morning, CEO Patterson fired off a blistering e-mail to company managers threatening to fire loafers and stop approving employee benefits. "Hell will freeze over" before he tolerates a less than "substantially full" lot at 7:30 a.m. again, he wrote. "You have two weeks. Tick, tock." A week later the e-mail was all over the Web, prompting Cerner's stock price to sink 22% in three days. 
IPO timing 
Best: Weight Watchers As comfort-seeking Americans stuffed themselves with junk food after Sept. 11--and news of Taliban defeats invigorated the market--underwriters for the Woodbury, N.Y., weight- loss specialist were able to raise the price for Weight Watchers' mid- November IPO by 9% at the last minute. Bargain-starved investors gobbled up shares of the business (endorsed by Fergie), driving shares up 23% the first day and fattening the company's wallet by $417 million. 
Worst: Prada The Milan fashion conglomerate planned an offering on the Italian market for this summer. But the weak economy caused Prada to delay till the fall; Sept. 11 caused another postponement, this time indefinitely. That was bad news for CEO Patrizio Bertelli, husband of designer Miuccia Prada, whose recent haute couture shopping spree has him struggling to pay off some very unfashionable debt. He was recently forced to unload his 25% stake in Italian fashion house Fendi. 
Candor 
Best: Procter & Gamble The George Washington of business this year, P&G couldn't tell a lie. It admitted to rival Unilever, unprompted, that it had hired spies to gather information on Unilever's shampoo business. The P&G snoops even rooted around in Unilever's trash. When P&G CEO John Pepper learned of the operation, he fired the three executives who had authorized it and began talks with Unilever, ultimately paying about $10 million and pledging never to use any of the information gained from its spies. 
Worst: Enron Let's see: Undisclosed transactions with funds controlled, at least in part, by CFO Andrew Fastow. Misstated earnings of more than $580 million going back to 1997. Some $1.2 billion in shareholder equity vanished. Oh, and as much as $27 billion in debt that appeared nowhere on its balance sheet. One could argue that if Enron had been more candid about how it made money, it might not have ended up as the largest corporate failure in U.S. history. Of course, if Enron had been forthcoming, it wouldn't have been Enron. 
Prediction 
Best: Stanley Roach The Morgan Stanley chief economist began warning of a 2001 recession way back in September 2000--well before any of his Wall Street colleagues. 
Worst: John Chambers Where's that 30% to 50% growth you were so fond of talking about, John? Cisco's pro forma earnings per share declined by 23% this year--and that's excluding all the write-offs for unsold inventory and bad investments that you'd rather investors ignore. The only Cisco number that's even close to 50% is the decline in the company's stock, which fell from around $38 in January to near $20 in early December. 
Family values 
Best: Rupert Murdoch Promoting your kid is one thing; sticking by him when he screws up is another. But that's just what Murdoch (above right) has done. The News Corp. CEO named eldest son Lachlan, 30 (above left), deputy chief operating officer last October. This year Lachlan lost millions of Dad's money when telecom startup OneTel, in which he'd invested the dough, went bankrupt. However, Rupert has continued to show faith in his son's business acumen; Lachlan has been busy shuffling executives in Australia and installing a new editor at the New York Post. 
Worst: Florence Fang No one likes to be fired, especially after less than a year on the job. But imagine how Ted Fang felt when, following a rocky start, he was ousted as publisher of the San Francisco Examiner by his own mother. (We also hear Fang is grounded.) 
Honorable mention: Jack Smith The General Motors CEO (above left) helped push out his little brother Mike (above right) as chairman of GM subsidiary Hughes Electronics in order to pave the way for its sale. 
Layoff policy 
Best: Charles Schwab Maybe there's no such thing as a good layoff. But at least the once fast-growing discount broker made an effort. Before chopping heads, founder Charles Schwab and his co-CEO each took a 50% pay cut; 750 other execs took cuts too, and the firm encouraged employees to take Fridays off without pay. Only after those measures failed did Schwab lay off 3,400 workers, in late March, softening the blow with 60 days' notice, stock-option grants, education stipends, and a promise to pay a $7,500 bonus to any employee who returned within 18 months. 
Worst: The airlines Ever wonder why airline workers always seem to be on strike? Just days after the Sept. 11 hijackings, even as they were securing a $15 billion bailout from Congress, the airlines announced plans to lay off an estimated 100,000 people. Three major carriers--American (20,000 job cuts), Delta (13,000), and Northwest (10,000)--invoked a force majeure clause claiming that emergency circumstances allowed them to bypass customary notice, severance, and early-retirement incentives; they later backed off a bit in the face of public opinion. 
Graceful exit 
Best: Herb Kelleher The retirement of the Southwest founder and CEO this year was as smooth as a three-point landing. Kelleher (right) leaves behind a cash-rich carrier that's well positioned to weather the problems battering the airline industry. Southwest, which refused to slash schedules after Sept. 11, was the only U.S. airline to report a profit in the third quarter. 
Worst: Linda Wachner Booted without severance after 15 years as CEO of Warnaco, Wachner leaves behind a company in desperate need of a turnaround. Thanks in part to Wachner's bloated compensation package, the women's apparel maker is bankrupt, and its stock, once worth $44, trades for pennies. Not only did Wachner let down shareholders, but she also did a stellar job of alienating key customers--most notably Calvin Klein, who called her a "cancer" on his brand. But Wachner isn't leaving quietly: She's considering suing Warnaco for the golden parachute--reportedly worth $44 million-- promised in her employment contract.

Power Player; Chuck Watson built Dynegy at blinding speed but was overshadowed by Enron. Now he's got the spotlight to himself.

On a cool day in Houston early last month, Dynegy chief Charles Watson announced the boldest deal of his career. In 15 years he had built the natural-gas producer into a powerhouse, but he chafed in the shadow of his far bigger hometown rival, Enron Corp., and its chairman, the silver-tongued Kenneth Lay. Lay's swagger personified the freewheeling energy-trading markets, and Enron dominated the action, but now the titan was reeling from allegations of dirty self-dealing, a raft of sudden resignations and an SEC investigation. Valued at $70 billion only months before, Enron was teetering on the brink of collapse. 
So Chuck Watson declared he would rescue his rival, at an especially sweet price: just $9 billion in Dynegy stock. Watson was sure the skeptics on Enron were wrong and that with a few problems solved Enron was still a rock-solid money machine. Its revenue grew 57% in the third quarter to $47 billion--more than one and a half times what Dynegy generated in all of 2000. For a fire-sale price, he boasted, Dynegy would suddenly expand sixfold into a $200 billion-a-year giant with $90 billion in assets. The supercharged firm would handle as much as one-quarter of U.S. energy trading. After operating in obscurity for years, Dynegy suddenly would become the second-largest corporation in America in sales--"a world-class energy merchant by anyone's definition," Watson proclaimed.
Two weeks later Watson's triumph ended in epic failure. He scuttled his dream deal after getting surprised by a string of horrifying financial revelations at Enron. The big rival's market cap had continued to plunge, falling to a level so low--less than $270 million--as to make Watson look like a sucker for ever offering $9 billion. Enron clearly was headed for Chapter 11, or even liquidation. The merger was off, and the recriminations and lawsuits were just beginning. 
"I was very disappointed," Watson says in characteristic, laconic understatement. He also was furious: Enron had tumbled into turmoil by misleading investors, and now it was misrepresenting its finances yet again--so says Watson--and laying the blame on Dynegy. "I just hope the other side doesn't think all this spinning, which got them into trouble to begin with, is going to get them out of it," he fumes. 
In the fallout, Enron struggles to stay alive, and Watson can count his blessings. In retreating, he has dodged Enron's $12 billion in debt, the dark cloud of the investigation now under way by the Securities & Exchange Commission, the devastated trading floor and a thicket of lawsuits and liabilities so massive and murky that they could end up burying everyone in sight. Instead, Watson is setting up the next chapter at Dynegy. He took it over in 1985 with a $600 investment and a 10% stake for himself, building it into a firm with a $10 billion market value (as of Nov. 30). With 5% now he's worth half a billion. 
Watson vows to make Dynegy even bigger, even better, and an undisputed leader in a gun-shy industry that has lost the stability and swagger of its once-dominant progenitor, Enron. Dynegy says it can grow at least 20% next year, to $35 billion in revenue. 
The death of Enron is a mixed blessing for Chuck Watson. Some of Enron's business and some of its brightest people will wind up at his firm; if he gets his way in court Watson will also get Enron's valuable pipeline system, Northern Natural Gas, in return for the $1.5 billion he poured into Enron in the course of the merger plans. The negative: litigation. Enron is threatening to sue Dynegy for backing out of the merger, and Enron's creditors are sure to pile on at some point. 
Even without swallowing the bigger Enron, Dynegy is a leading processor of natural gas and one of the top three transporters on every interstate pipeline in North America. Its power plants generate 19,000 megawatts of electricity, enough for a city of 8 million. In the commodity derivatives markets, where suppliers and utilities lock in future prices, Dynegy is a top trader in natural gas, power, coal, emission credits and weather derivatives. But these volatile trading businesses, which contributed 80% of Enron's alleged earnings but ultimately could not make up for its blunders elsewhere, are merely a healthy sideline at Dynegy, contributing only 20% of earnings. 
And Watson may yet have a multibillion-dollar merger in his future. Big rivals such as American Electric Power, Duke Energy and Reliant outmuscle Dynegy in some markets, making them attractive partners. He expresses keen interest in doing more deals, having made nine acquisitions since 1995, which has kept Dynegy's top line growing a hefty 45% a year. Last year its stock jumped 218%, the second-best performance in the S&P 500. Even on the day Watson bailed out of buying Enron, he inked a $600 million purchase of another outfit, BG Storage. He's a gambler whose winning streak might not have ended. 
Enron and Dynegy were born the same year--1985--but took very different paths. Ken Lay started out with $10 billion in revenues from the merger of two energy companies, Houston Natural Gas and InterNorth. Then he won fame and accolades for transforming a stodgy old gas business into a sexy wheeler-dealer, doing for energy what Nasdaq did for stocks: creating a highly liquid, over-the-counter market for all kinds of contracts. In the process, he slapped Enron's name on a new sports stadium and hobnobbed with the likes of Dick Cheney and George W. Bush. 
Chuck Watson started out with far less. Dynegy began life under the unpromising name of the U.S. Natural Gas Clearinghouse, a marketing arm jointly owned by six pipeline companies, Morgan Stanley and the law firm Akin Gump. Nor was Watson some headhunter's superstar: He began his career as a lowly trainee at Conoco. Even after Dynegy hit the big leagues, Watson's aw-shucks manner kept him out of the public eye; he frequently says he'd rather let his customers talk up Dynegy than do it himself. Flashy, no, but competitive, hell yes: He is so fierce a warrior on the links that when he was recovering from an Achilles tendon injury recently, he borrowed an oversize golf shoe to fit it over his sore, swollen foot rather than miss combat in 18 holes. 
Always scrappy and still athletic at 51, Watson was born in Great Lakes, Ill., one of four children of a salesman who hawked space in industrial parks. The family moved around a lot and Watson attended 22 schools in nine states. Sports let him fit in quickly. He was driving for a college basketball scholarship until he seriously injured his back in a car wreck as a high school senior in Ft. Smith, Ark. On graduating from Oklahoma State in 1972, he took a job with Conoco in Ponca City, Okla. so he could stay close to his college sweetheart, Kim, who now has been married to him for 28 years. The summer job turned full-time, and in the next 12 years Watson worked his way up at Conoco to the middling title of sales director. 
It was 1984, natural gas was on the verge of revolution, and Watson wanted to be in the vanguard. "A lot of people in this business were scared by deregulation," he recalls. "I was excited by the opportunities." Opportunity arrived in the form of the slapped-together U.S. Natural Gas Clearinghouse. 
Watson first turned down the job. It looked unworkable. The pipeline companies might try to force the fledgling firm to do business only with their own pipelines; how would he push them aside? His suitors kept wooing him, offering a sizable raise, and finally Watson relented, with one condition: "Don't pay me a salary--give me 10% of the company." He got both, the equity initially taking the form of phantom stock--in effect, a long-term option. 
On Watson's first day on the job, only 6 of the 60 employees borrowed from the parent firms showed up. He told the no-shows not to come back. Later that year he bought out the 10% stakes from the pipelines for $100 each and then he got Akin Gump to sell, leaving Morgan as sole shareholder. His vision was clear from day one. Hundreds of brokers were jumping in, many armed with just a phone and a Rolodex. Competing with them was a losing game. Suppliers and buyers would eventually get each other's phone numbers, and one day the fat middleman spreads that Watson's shop relied on would evaporate. Then what? 
With the backing of Morgan Stanley and a surfeit of underground salt domes for gas storage, Watson figured he could buy gas at wellheads and deliver it when and where customers wanted, holding it for them when they didn't need it and serving it up when demand surged. This meant Watson would assume the risk of holding gas that might tumble in price; but any trader could handle that risk with some artful hedges. 
The startup was barely making payroll when Watson arrived, turning a sale a week and celebrating each with a round of cigars. Watson nixed the cigars and started turning multiple sales a day. He worked his contacts and had staff cold-calling corporate gas users to drum up business. 
By 1989 Morgan Stanley wanted out and sold the company for $16 million. The buyers were three energy companies (British Gas, Nova and Chevron) and employees. Morgan was happy with its tidy profit. Had it held on, its stake would be worth $10 billion. 
Meanwhile Ken Lay at Enron was discovering the same potential in gas trading. Deregulation had left producers and utilities at the mercy of volatile spot prices. Lay began writing long-term contracts to buy or sell gas at fixed prices. Business grew more stable at both ends of the pipeline. Eventually the raw trading of these contracts--rather than delivering on them--became Enron's mainstay. 
In the mid-1990s electricity joined gas on the deregulatory path. Watson wanted in but needed currency. So in 1995 he bought Trident, a publicly held ethylene producer; the reverse merger gave him new access to money in the capital markets. The following fall, Watson cut a deal with Chevron to sell the oil giant's entire North American gas output, the first such exclusive marketing deal. It was precisely what Watson had in mind all along. The gas producer receives market prices at its wells. Watson takes ownership, transports, stores and delivers the energy at a markup. He compares the approach to that of grain trader Cargill. 
Business was booming, but Watson wanted to buy a lot more gas processing plants and electric power plants. The problem was in raising the cash. Dynegy had a public currency, but 88% was now in the hands of employees and three institutions. There wasn't enough of a float to attract institutional shareholders. So Watson walked into a meeting of his owners in Scotland in 1997 with a blunt message: "We have a problem. It's in this room. Two of you have to go. I don't care which." Then he walked out. Nova and British Gas exited. The company's float went to 60% overnight. The next year Watson changed Natural Gas Clearinghouse's name to Dynegy, excising an "r" to dodge a preexisting British claim. Then he used his stock to make his boldest push yet into power. Illinova, an Illinois generating firm, was nearly insolvent. Watson bought it for a pittance. 
Enron was having a field day with deregulation, too. Instead of buying electricity from a plant and selling it elsewhere for a tiny cut, it began carving output into pieces, much as Wall Street slices Treasurys into Treasury strips. Enron would guarantee a utility running a distribution grid all the power it would need on a hot summer afternoon. An aluminum smelter would pay half as much but suffer some interruptions. 
As Enron's confidence grew, its trades got more exotic, involving derivatives on pulp, metals, pollution and the weather. In late 1999 the firm shifted much of its business to EnronOnline, basking in the dot-com craze. The site soon was handling $3 billion in trades daily. Revenues in 2000 doubled to $101 billion. Reported earnings before interest and taxes hit $2.3 billion. At a January 2001 analyst meeting, company execs suggested Enron's price of $80 a share was inadequate, notwithstanding that it was 46 times earnings. The shares should have been going for $126, said President Jeffrey Skilling. 
By then Enron and Dynegy had gone separate ways. Enron was selling assets, earning 80% of its profits from trading and 20% from energy. At Dynegy the ratios were reversed. In February Lay handed the top job to Skilling, chief advocate of Enron's asset-lite strategy. Lay became elder statesman. 
Skilling epitomized Enron's hubris. He had once said of a rival, "If Thomas Alva Edison came back from the dead and called Southern Co. he'd find nothing has changed." Of Enron: "We're on the side of angels. People want open, competitive markets .... It's the American way." To goose earnings, Skilling set up outside partnerships. They, in turn, issued Enron-backed bonds and used the proceeds to buy power plants, fiber optics and other assets from Enron. Then Enron plowed the cash into its trading business while the debt--and losses--moved off its books. 
The questions started getting prickly when Enron's stock price fell in the spring. Its business of trading fiber-optic capacity, with revenues of more than $300 million in 2000, lost $137 million in the first half of 2001 as sales plunged. In mid-August Skilling abruptly quit. Speculation was that something was seriously amiss. Then on Oct. 16 Enron set a $1 billion third-quarter charge related to a partnership linked to Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, plus a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity due to "accounting errors." Rumors were rampant that trading partners were avoiding Enron and that it was on the brink of a credit downgrade that would force it to immediately repay $3.9 billion in debt, pushing it into bankruptcy. 
On Oct. 25, Dynegy President Stephen Bergstrom was invited to lunch by Stanley Horton, chief of Enron's pipeline group. Horton--without first telling Ken Lay of his plans--told Bergstrom that Enron was in deep trouble and that a merger with Dynegy was the best way out. But it had to happen fast. 
Enron's desperate plea in hand, Bergstrom called Watson, who was outside an operating room in St. Louis where his mother was having heart surgery. "I was intrigued and honored they had come to us," Watson recalls. He set one demand: Ken Lay had to call him personally. Lay called him the next day, and on Saturday morning Watson and Lay chewed over a deal in Lay's kitchen. Watson offered a deal with no premium over Enron's depressed price. Lay accepted and said he would step aside. 
Dynegy was an obvious mate. The firms are right across the street from each other, and many employees have worked at both. Their traders live in the same neighborhoods--the Young Turks in West University and the superstars in River Oaks. They send their kids to ritzy St. John's School. "The press loves the rivalry between Enron and Dynegy, but on a lot of issues, we're on the same page," Bergstrom says. 
For Dynegy, Enron's crunch was sweet revenge. Dynegy execs chafed at the the dowdy image they were accorded despite fast growth and a soaring stock. Lay put Enron's name on Houston's new baseball stadium. Watson bragged about his small p.r. staff. A media search yields 91,000 mentions of Enron in five years--six times as many as for Dynegy. 
For all their folksiness, Dynegy execs were talking trash about Enron for years. Off the record, they questioned Enron's assertions it held "balanced books" of commitments to buy and sell commodities and suggested their rival was laying risky bets on the direction of gas and electricity prices. 
Investment bankers came in to do the paperwork. Dynegy merger chief Hugh Tarpley, an alum of Notre Dame, coined the de rigeur code names: Dynegy was the heroic Rockne; Enron, fittingly, was the Gipper--the dying football player. Watson, meanwhile, was hosting a week-long pro-am golf tournament for 300 clients, one of his first forays into big-time promotion. Some events he couldn't miss, like a round of golf with Tiger Woods. When guests asked where he was, underlings made excuses. On the last day of the tournament, someone noticed Watson heading toward the course in a golf cart wearing business shoes, a clue that he was headed for merger talks; he feigned forgetfulness. 
Chief Financial Officer Robert Doty, meanwhile, was poring over Enron's financials and feeling fine. "We got a lot of comfort that the core business was operating well and capable of generating great cash flow," Doty recalls. But ChevronTexaco, which owns 26% of Dynegy, scrutinized the deal and asked--why not wait for Enron to fall into bankruptcy and buy it at a distress sale? In the end Chevron put $1.5 billion into Dynegy, which used it to buy 100% of the preferred stock in the Enron unit that owns its prized Northern Natural Gas pipeline. That, along with $1 billion more at the merger's close, was expected to give Enron the liquidity it needed. 
Watson unveiled his daring rescue plan on Friday, Nov. 9, reserving the right to call off the deal if Enron's liabilities rose, or profits fell, below certain levels. His hole card: a clause stating Dynegy's $1.5 billion investment gave it the right to keep the big pipeline even if the deal was aborted. "There was a lot we didn't know," he admits, "but we thought we'd adequately protected our shareholders." Dynegy's stock had a quick 28% run-up on news of the bid. 
If Skilling is to go down in history books for his hubris, Watson should get a mention, too. J.P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup offered to inject $500 million or more in equity capital into Enron. Watson, confident that Enron's hemorrhaging was over, brushed aside the offer. 
The euphoria faded fast. On Nov. 19 Enron filed quarterly financials that held two bombshells. Recent credit downgrades to a notch above junk had put Enron on the hook to repay $690 million to a partnership in just a week--something Enron had never warned Dynegy about. What's more, Enron had $1 billion less in cash on hand than it was supposed to have. 
Watson was stunned. Enron had provided a peek at the numbers two weeks before, but none of this was disclosed (Enron has disputed this). Watson says that Dynegy got the full filing just three hours before it was made public and that only then did he know his deal was in trouble. What else had Enron failed to disclose? Negotiations went on even as Enron shares fell to $4 and lower. On Nov. 28 three credit agencies downgraded Enron to junk status. That morning Watson called Lay and killed the deal. Lay was cordial. 
The niceties ended there. Dynegy issued a press release staking its claim to Northern Natural Gas and accusing Enron of misrepresentation. Enron's chief financial officer, Jeffrey McMahon, disputed that claim and said Dynegy saw the financials in advance, hinting Dynegy may owe Enron a $350 million breakup fee. Bunk, says Watson: "It's real cute for Jeff to say we got an advance copy when it was 110 pages we received just three hours in advance." 
Even if Dynegy's biggest deal slipped through Watson's fingers there is a big world of opportunities in energy. In Europe, Dynegy has a growing presence and can play the same games it did in the U.S. as the energy industry there deregulates. 
Back at home, Watson confronts months of legal wrangling and a long struggle to reclaim legitimacy for the energy-trading business. The recent chaos in California and the collapse of Enron will make further deregulation--and Dynegy's stock--a tough sale.

AFTERSHOCKS IN EUROPE Enron's collapse will hit many markets
By David Fairlamb in Paris

Enron Corp. may be based in Houston, but its spectacular collapse has had almost as big an impact in Europe as in the U.S. The energy trader's bankruptcy has sent European banks, investors, electricity consumers, and champions of Europewide energy deregulation reeling. And it's not just the energy markets that have been thrown into confusion. Enron was active in a number of other European sectors, including metals and pulp and paper trading. It even owns a windmill manufacturer in Germany. ``This was a global company whose collapse will be felt right around the world,'' says Alessandro Profumo, CEO of UniCredito Italiano. 
Profumo should know. Over the last year, the Milan bank loaned Enron an estimated $20 million. All told, European banks have admitted to lending Enron and its subsidiaries more than $2 billion. In addition, analysts calculate, there is up to a billion dollars further exposure in the form of derivatives and trading contracts.
The European bank reported to have the largest loan exposure to Enron--between $500 million and $800 million--is Royal Bank of Scotland. RBS executives aren't talking, but their stock has taken a big hit. Other banks with sizable Enron loan exposure include Britain's Abbey National, France's Credit Lyonnais, and the Netherlands' ABN Amro (table). ``Enron isn't on the same scale as the Long-Term Credit Management collapse [in 1998],'' says Peter Luxton, global economic adviser to Standard & Poor's Corp., ``but it still has a huge effect.'' 
In recent days, the scale of that financial damage has become clearer. The result could well be tighter credit for many companies just as Europe's economy softens. Spreads in the corporate fixed income market widened by up to 40 basis points between Nov. 28 and Dec. 5. Adding to the pressure is the fear that there is more risk in the credit markets than was realized. ``We didn't know Enron, but lent on the back of its credit rating,'' says Profumo. As Enron sank, he adds, ``the first question I asked my colleagues was: `What is the value of a rating?''' Just a few months ago, the parent company had an AA rating from the main agencies. It's now rated as junk. 
Banks aren't the only ones affected. Enron stock and bonds were widely held by European mutual funds and insurers. The lucky ones offloaded their stakes as the extent of the company's problems started to come out. ``I knew I had to get out in August, when they canceled a meeting with me at the last minute--after I'd arrived in Houston,'' says a fund manager at a private German bank. He quickly dumped $50 million of Enron stock. Insurers that still held big blocks of Enron shares when it collapsed include Germany's Allianz, France's AXA, and Holland's Aegon. Analysts estimate Aegon's exposure at $200 million. 
Meanwhile, Europe's spot and futures markets for electricity are in chaos. Enron was a big electricity supplier and trader in Europe, at the height of its activity accounting for up to 20% of volume traded on the energy exchanges. Most energy and power companies already had wound down their exposure to Enron by the time its collapse became imminent. But the scale of the company's problems and the speed with which it collapsed have unsettled many traders. Not surprisingly, the price of energy futures is on the way up. Because Enron's aggressive pricing had helped bring down tariffs, businesses and domestic consumers will have to pay more for their energy this winter. Prices will probably rise fastest--up to 2.5%--in Britain's deregulated market, say analysts. Enron was a particularly large player there, producing electricity and delivering it to 2.2 million retail consumers and thousands of companies. 
Even more than in the U.S., Enron's woes are likely to increase resistance to energy deregulation. Although Germany and Britain have almost wholly liberalized their markets, progress elsewhere, especially France, has been slow. Opponents of reform will use the Enron debacle to hold up the process. ``They're going to make a real meal out of this in Paris,'' says a European Commission official in Brussels. This American bankruptcy is Europe's headache.

Cover Story
THE FALL OF ENRON How ex-CEO Jeff Skilling's strategy grew so complex that even his boss couldn't get a handle on it
By Wendy Zellner and Stephanie Anderson Forest in Dallas with Emily Thornton, Peter Coy, Heather Timmons, Louis Lavelle, and David Henry in New York, and bureau reports

To former Enron CEO Jeffrey K. Skilling, there were two kinds of people in the world: those who got it and those who didn't. ``It'' was Enron's complex strategy for minting rich profits and returns from a trading and risk-management business built essentially on assets owned by others. Vertically integrated behemoths like ExxonMobil Corp., whose balance sheet was rich with oil reserves, gas stations, and other assets, were dinosaurs to a contemptuous Skilling. ``In the old days, people worked for the assets,'' Skilling mused in an interview last January. ``We've turned it around--what we've said is the assets work for the people.'' 
But who looks like Tyrannosaurus Rex now? As Enron Corp. struggles to salvage something from the nation's largest bankruptcy case, filed on Dec. 2, it's clear that the real Enron was a far cry from the nimble ``asset light'' market maker that Skilling proclaimed. And the financial maneuvering and off-balance-sheet partnerships that he and ex-Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow perfected to remove everything from telecom fiber to water companies from Enron's debt-heavy balance sheet helped spark the company's implosion. ``Jeff's theory was assets were bad, intellectual capital was good,'' says one former senior executive. Employees readily embraced the rhetoric, the executive says, but they ``didn't understand how it was funded.''
Neither did many others. Bankers, stock analysts, auditors, and Enron's own board failed to comprehend the risks in this heavily leveraged trading giant. Enron's bankruptcy filings show $13.1 billion in debt for the parent company and an additional $18.1 billion for affiliates. But that doesn't include at least $20 billion more estimated to exist off the balance sheet. Kenneth L. Lay, 59, who had nurtured Skilling, 48, as his successor, sparked the first wave of panic when he revealed in an Oct. 16 conference call with analysts that deals involving partnerships run by his CFO would knock $1.2 billion off shareholder equity. Lay, who had been out of day-to-day management for years, was never able to clearly explain how the partnerships worked or why anyone shouldn't assume the worst--that they were set up to hide Enron's problems, inflate earnings, and personally benefit the executives who managed some of them. 
That uncertainty ultimately scuttled Enron's best hope for a rescue: its deal to be acquired by its smaller but healthier rival, Dynegy Inc. Now Enron is frantically seeking a rock-solid banking partner to help maintain some shred of its once-mighty trading empire. Already, 4,000 Enron workers in Houston have lost their jobs. And hundreds of creditors, from banks to telecoms to construction companies, are trying to recover part of the billions they're owed. 
From the beginning, Lay had a vision for Enron that went far beyond that of a traditional energy company. When Lay formed Enron from the merger of two pipeline companies in 1985, he understood that deregulation of the business would offer vast new opportunities. To exploit them, he turned to Skilling, then a McKinsey & Co. consultant. Skilling was the chief nuts-and-bolts-operator from 1997 until his departure last summer, and the architect of an increasingly byzantine financial structure. After he abruptly quit in August, citing personal reasons, and his right-hand financier Fastow was ousted Oct. 24, there was no one left to explain it. 
Much of the blame for Enron's collapse has focused on the partnerships, but the seeds of its destruction were planted well before the October surprises. According to former insiders and other sources close to Enron, it was already on shaky financial ground from a slew of bad investments, including overseas projects ranging from a water business in England to a power distributor in Brazil. ``You make enough billion-dollar mistakes, and they add up,'' says one source close to Enron's top executives. In June, Standard & Poor's analysts put the company on notice that its underperforming international assets were of growing concern. But S&P, which like BusinessWeek is a unit of The McGraw-Hill companies, ultimately reaffirmed the credit ratings, based on Enron's apparent willingness to sell assets and take other steps. 
Behind all the analyses of Enron was the assumption that the core energy business was thriving. It was still growing rapidly, but margins were inevitably coming down as the market matured. ``Once that growth slowed, any weakness would start becoming more apparent,'' says Standard & Poor's Corp. director Todd A. Shipman. ``They were not the best at watching their cost.'' Indeed, the tight risk controls that seemed to work well in the trading business apparently didn't apply to other parts of the company. 
Skilling's answer to growing competition in energy trading was to push Enron's innovative techniques into new arenas, everything from broadband to metals, steel, and even advertising time and space. Skilling knew he had to find a way to finance his big growth plans and manage the international problems without killing the company's critical investment-grade credit rating. Without a clever solution, trading partners would flee, or the cost of doing deals would become insurmountable. ``HE'S HEARTBROKEN.'' No one ever disputed that Skilling was clever. The Pittsburgh-born son of a sales manager for an Illinois valve company, he took over as production director at a startup Aurora (Ill.) TV station at age 13 when an older staffer quit and he was the only one who knew how to operate the equipment. Skilling landed a full-tuition scholarship to Southern Methodist University in Dallas to study engineering, but quickly changed to business. After graduation, he went to work for a Houston bank. The bank later went bust while Skilling was at Harvard Business School. Skilling said that fiasco made him determined to keep strict risk controls on Enron's trading business. He once told BusinessWeek that ``I've never not been successful in business or work, ever.'' Skilling now declines to comment, but his brother Tom, a Chicago TV weatherman, says of him: ``He's heartbroken over what's going on there.... We were not raised to look on these kinds of things absent emotion.'' 
Enron's ``intellectual capital'' was Skilling's pride and joy. He recruited more than 250 newly minted MBAs each year from the nation's top business schools. Meteorologists and PhDs in math and economics helped analyze and model the vast amounts of data that Enron used in its trading operations. A forced ranking system weeded out the poor performers. ``It was as competitive internally as it was externally,'' says one former executive. 
It was no surprise then that Skilling would turn to a bright young finance wizard, Fastow, to help him find capital for his rapidly expanding empire. Boasting an MBA from Northwestern University, Fastow was recruited to Enron in 1990 from Continental Bank, where he worked on leveraged buyouts. Articulate, handsome, and mature beyond his years, he became Enron's CFO at age 36. In October, 1999, he earned CFO Magazine's CFO Excellence Award for Capital Structure Management. An effusive Skilling crowed to the magazine: ``We didn't want someone stuck in the past, since the industry of yesterday is no longer. Andy has the intelligence and the youthful exuberance to think in new ways.'' 
But Skilling's fondness for the buttoned-down Fastow was not widely shared. Many colleagues considered him a prickly, even vindictive man, prone to attacking those he didn't like in Enron's group performance reviews. Fastow, through his attorney, declined to comment for this story. When he formed and took a personal stake in the LJM partnerships that blew up in October, the conflict of interest inherent in those deals only added to his colleagues' distaste for him. Enron admits Fastow earned more than $30 million from the partnerships. The Enron CFO wasn't any more popular on Wall Street, where investment bankers bristled at the finance group's ``we're smarter than you guys'' attitude. Indeed, that came back to haunt Enron when it needed capital commitments to stem the liquidity crisis. ``It's the sort of organization about which people said, `Screw them. We don't really owe them anything,''' says one investment banker. 
While LJM--and Fastow's direct personal involvement and enrichment--shocked many, the deal was just the latest version of a financing strategy that Skilling and Fastow had used to good effect many times since the mid-'90s to fund investments with private equity while keeping assets and debt off the balance sheet. Keeping the debt off Enron's books depended on a steady or rising stock price and an investment- grade credit rating. ``They were put together with good intentions to offset some risk,'' says S&P analyst Ron M. Barone. ``It's conceivable that it got away from them.`` 
Did it ever. The off-balance-sheet structures grew increasingly complex and risky, according to insiders and others who have studied the deals. Some, with names like Osprey, Whitewing, and Marlin, were revealed in Enron's financial filings and even rated by the big credit-rating agencies. But almost no one seemed to have a clear picture of Enron's total debt, what triggers might hasten repayment, or how some of the deals could dilute shareholder equity. ``No one ever sat down and added up how many liabilities would come due if this company got downgraded,'' says one lender involved with Enron. Many investors were unaware of provisions in some deals that could essentially dump the debts back on Enron. In some cases, if Enron's stock fell below a certain price and the credit rating dropped below investment grade--once unimaginable--nearly $4 billion in partnership debt would have to be covered by Enron. At the same time, the value of the assets in many of these partnerships was dropping, making it even harder for Enron to cover the debt. HIGH HOPES. Skilling tried to accelerate the sale of international assets after becoming chief operating officer in 1997, but the efforts were arduous and time-consuming. Even as tech stocks melted down, Skilling was determined not to scale back his grandiose broadband trading dreams or the resulting price-to-earnings multiple of almost 60 that they helped create for Enron's stock. At its peak in August, 2000, about a third of the stock's $90 price was attributable to expectations for growth of broadband trading, executives estimate. 
That rapidly rising stock price--up 55% in '99 and 87% in 2000--gave Skilling and Fastow a hot currency for luring investors into their off-balance-sheet deals. They quickly became dependent on such deals to finance their expansion efforts. ``It was like crack,'' says a company insider. Trouble is, Enron's stock came tumbling back to earth when market valuations fell this year. By April, its price had fallen to about 55. And its far-flung operational troubles were taking their own toll. In its much-hyped broadband business, for instance, a capacity glut and financial meltdown made it hard to find creditworthy counterparties for trading. And after spending some $1.2 billion to build and operate a fiber-optic network, Enron found itself with an asset whose value was rapidly deteriorating. Even last year, company executives could see the need to cut back an operation that had 1,700 employees and a cash burn rate of $700 million a year. ``SOMETHING TO PROVE.'' And the international problems weren't going away. Enron's 65% stake in the $3 billion Dabhol power plant in India was mired in a dispute with its largest customer, which refused to pay for electricity. Some Indian politicians have despised the deal for years, claiming that cunning and even corrupt Enron executives cut a deal that charged India too much for its power. 
Enron's ill-fated 1998 investment in the water-services business was another drag on earnings. Many saw the purchase of Wessex Water in England as a ``consolation prize'' for Rebecca P. Mark, the hard-charging Enron executive who had negotiated the Dabhol deal and other investments around the world. With Skilling having won out as Lay's clear heir apparent, top executives wanted to move her out of the way, say former insiders. A narrowly split board approved the Wessex deal, which formed the core of Azurix Corp., to be run by Mark. But Enron was blindsided by British regulators who slashed the rates the utility could charge. Meanwhile, Mark piled on more high-priced water assets. ``Once [Skilling] put her there, he let her go wild,'' says a former executive. ``And she's going to go wild because she has something to prove.'' Mark spent too much on a water concession in Brazil and ran into political obstacles. She declined to comment for this story. 
But if Azurix was a prime example of Enron's sketchy investment strategy, it also demonstrated how the company tried to disguise its problems with financial alchemy. To set up the company, Enron formed a partnership called the Atlantic Water Trust, in which it held a 50% stake. That kept Wessex off Enron's balance sheet. Enron's partner in the joint venture was Marlin Water Trust, which consisted of institutional investors. To help attract them, Enron promised to back up the debt with its own stock if necessary. But if Enron's credit rating fell below investment grade and the stock fell below a certain point, Enron could be on the hook for the partnership's $915 million in debt. 
The end for Enron came when its murky finances and less-than-forthright disclosures spooked investors and Dynegy. The clincher came when Dynegy's bankers spent hours sifting through a supposedly final draft of Enron's about-to-be-released 10Q--only to discover two pages of damning new numbers when the quarterly statement was made publicly available. Debt coming due in the fourth quarter had leapt from under $1 billion to $2.8 billion. Even worse, cash on hand--to which Dynegy had recently contributed $1.5 billion--shrunk from $3 billion to $1.2 billion. Dynegy ``had a two-hour meeting with the new treasurer of Enron, who had been in that seat for two weeks,'' said a source close to the deal. ``He had no clue where the numbers came from.'' RESPECT FOR ASSETS. Skilling and Fastow face most of the wrath of reeling employees. ``Someone told me yesterday if they see Jeff Skilling on the street, they would scratch out his eyes,'' says a former executive. One of Fastow's lawyers, David B. Gerger, says his client has been the subject of death threats and anti-Semitic tirades in Internet chat rooms. ``Naturally people look for scapegoats, but it would be wrong to scapegoat Mr. Fastow,'' says Gerger. 
He confirms that Fastow has hired a big gun to handle his civil litigation: David Boies's firm, which represented the Justice Dept. in its suit against Microsoft Corp. On Dec. 5, Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach filed a suit against Fastow, Skilling, and 27 other Enron executives, saying they illegally made more than $1 billion off stock sales before Enron tanked. And a source at the Securities & Exchange Commission says four U.S. Attorney Offices are considering whether to pursue criminal charges against Enron and its officers. 
Would the cash squeeze have caught up to Enron, even without Skilling's and Fastow's fancy financing? Credit analysts still argue that the debt would have been manageable, absent the crisis of confidence that dried up Enron's trading business and access to the capital markets. But even they have a new respect for old-fashioned, high-quality assets. ``When things get really tough, hard assets are the kind you can depend upon,'' says S&P's Shipman. That's something Enron's whiz-kid financiers failed to appreciate.

ENRON: LET US COUNT THE CULPRITS

12/17/2001
BusinessWeek 
154
(Copyright 2001 McGraw-Hill, Inc.) 

Enron Corp.'s bankruptcy is a disaster of epic proportions by any measure--the height from which it fell, the speed with which it has unraveled, and the pain it has inflicted on investors, employees, and creditors. Virtually all the checks and balances designed to prevent this kind of financial meltdown failed. Unless remedied, this could undermine public trust, the capital markets, and the nation's entire equity culture. Even now, no one really knows what liabilities are buried inside dozens of partnerships or the role ex-CEO Jeffrey Skilling played in creating a byzantine system of off-balance-sheet operations. A culture of secrecy and a remarkable lack of transparency prevented any realistic assessment of the company's financial risk. Nothing less than an overhaul of the auditing profession is now required to police accounting standards. Wall Street, mutual funds, and the business press would also do well to rethink why each, in its own way, celebrated what is now revealed to be an arrogant, duplicitous company managed in a dangerous manner (page 30). 
What is increasingly clear is that Skilling, a former McKinsey & Co. consultant and Harvard Business School grad, tried to craft Enron as a new kind of virtual trading giant, operating outside the scrutiny of investors and regulators. Enron's numerous partnerships were shrouded in secrecy, tucked away off the balance sheet. They were used to shift debt and assets off the books while inflating earnings. The chief financial officer ran and partly owned two partnerships, a clear conflict of interest. Enron leveraged itself without a reality check by any outsider. ASLEEP. Hardly anyone inside the company was urging caution, certainly not chairman Ken Lay. The independent auditing committee on the board of directors was clearly asleep. Given Enron's arcane financial engineering, the committee probably relied on Arthur Andersen, the auditor, for information. But Andersen didn't blow any whistles. No surprise there. It made more money selling consulting services to Enron last year than it did auditing the company. Criticizing Enron's books might have jeopardized consulting work. Similar conflicts of interest stopped Wall Street analysts from pulling the plug on Enron. Even as Enron slid toward bankruptcy, ``buy'' recommendations were being issued by analysts whose firms were doing investment-banking business with the company, or were hoping to.
Did anyone really know what was going on inside Enron? The rating agencies, Moody's Investor Service and Standard & Poor's, presumably had better access than average investors, but neither downgraded Enron's credit rating to below investment grade until the bitter end. The rating agencies argue that had they downgraded Enron sooner, they would have simply pushed the company into bankruptcy earlier. Here's a flash: So what? Moody's and S&P have one basic job--assessing risk for investors. If they couldn't penetrate Enron's complex financial engineering, the rating agencies should have said so. 
The business press, including BusinessWeek, did no better. It celebrated Skilling's vision of Enron as a virtual company that could securitize anything and trade it anywhere. The press blithely accepted Enron as the epitome of a new, post-deregulation corporate model when it should have been much more aggressive in probing the company's opaque partnerships, off balance sheet maneuvers, and soaring leverage. TRAGIC. Enron's fall is made all the more tragic because of the pain inflicted on its thousands of employees. Not only are many losing their jobs, but some 12,000 are also losing most of their retirement savings. In perhaps its most egregious risk-management error, employees mostly held Enron stock in their 401(k)s, yet the company prevented them from selling until they reached the age of 54. People could only watch as the stock plummeted from $89 to a dollar. Diversification, particularly in retirement accounts, is the cardinal rule in managing risk. Enron broke that rule, as have other companies. 
Enron's tale is a clarifying event. It reveals key weaknesses in the financial system that must be corrected as the U.S. moves forward in the 21st century. If America is to have an equity culture in which individuals invest in stocks and provide the capital for fast economic growth, the market must be able to correctly value companies. This requires making financial data readily available and easily comprehensible. 
To restore public confidence, several steps should be taken. After accounting disasters at MicroStrategy, Cendant, Lucent, Cisco, and Waste Management, it is clear that self-regulation is not working. Conflicts of interest within auditing firms remain widespread. Investors can ignore analysts on TV who work for investment firms. But someone has to play the role of the honest watchdog. Unless the Big Five auditing firms clean up their act, they will wind up with a federally chartered oversight body. It is equally clear that current standard accounting rules aren't sufficient. Loopholes allowed Enron to fool everyone, making a mockery of public disclosure. 
Regulators should also insist that corporations give their employees choice in their 401(k)s. Some 30% of assets held in 1.5 million 401(k) plans are in the stock of the company sponsoring the plan. This lack of diversification puts too many people at risk. 
In the end, the Enron story is about a secretive corporate culture that failed in its primary business mission: to manage risk. Had the Federal Reserve and other central banks not flooded the global economy with liquidity in recent months, Enron's collapse could have posed a deep threat to the financial markets. It's past time to fix the system.

Enron corp. used to talk about becoming the world's biggest company. Instead, it became the world's biggest corporate failure, filing for bankruptcy last week. The company, which used complexity to its advantage on the way up, became a victim of its own complex dealmaking on the way down. A NEWSWEEK examination of Enron's filings shows that the company's fatal mistake was an unintended byproduct of one such deal. The transaction first inflated Enron's reportednet worth, then deflated it. When the company cleaned up its books this fall, it triggered the $1.2 billion net-worth write-down that touched off the downward spiral that led to bankruptcy. 
Enron looked like a well-oiled machine, but a lot of it seems to have been jury-rigged. The company was housed in a spiffy 50-story building in downtown Houston, a structure whose elevators flashed Enron's latest stock price and delivered upbeat messages to get employees pumped by the time they got to their offices. In the best New Economy tradition, Enron had an on-site health club, casual dress and employees piling up paper wealth by investing in Enron stock.
But when things started going bad, Enron couldn't cope. It couldn't even fire people properly. Information-technology specialist Diana Peters says her entire department was told to clear out on half an hour's notice and to call their office voice mail to see if they should return to work the next day. Very classy. "I was crying, a lot of people were crying," says Peters, 51. "It reminded me of a mass funeral." 
The company even had trouble going broke. Normally, a company hoards cash in preparation for bankruptcy by accelerating collections from its customers and slowing down payments to vendors. Enron didn't start doing that until a few days before the filing, far too late. Enron almost became the Flying Dutchman of the bankruptcy world. It wanted to file in Wilmington, Dela., but the bankruptcy court there didn't want the case. So Enron ended up in New York City. And it was so short of cash that it had to scurry around to line up $1.5 billion of so-called debtor-in-possession financing to keep the place operating. Normally, you make DIP arrangements before you file. 
It would be lots of fun to give you Washington's take on all this, Enron being famous for close ties to the White House and the Republican Party. But we'll leave that for another day, because the juicy stuff probably won't show up until the Democrats get in gear. Hearings in the Republican-controlled House are set for this week, and will focus on accounting and stock analysts and the Securities and Exchange Commission rather than on Enron's political relationships and what, if anything, the White House did during Enron's final days. 
Although some details are still murky, one thing is clear: Arthur Andersen, Enron's outside accountant, is in big trouble, and it (or its insurers) will have to fork over big bucks. Andersen's big problem stems from a company called JEDI--as in "Star Wars"--that Enron now says should have been on its books since 1997. Andersen allowed JEDI to remain off the books for years. The other deal, involving a company called Raptor, caused the net-worth disappearance that set Enron on the road to ruin. 
JEDI stands for Joint Energy Development Investments. It was a partnership between Enron and the California state-employees' pension fund, known as Cal-pers. The Force was with Enron, which invested the money--$250 million each from itself and Calpers--in power plants, energy stocks and such, making more than 20 percent a year. Pretty neat. In late 1997, Calpers was willing to invest $500 million in a new partnership, JEDI 2. But it wanted to first cash in its JEDI 1 chips, worth $383 million. Instead of just liquidating JEDI, Enron got cute. (I'm not sure why. Enron declined to comment.) It went looking for an outsider to fork over $383 million and take Calpers's place. Enter something called Chewco Investments--as in Chewbacca of "Star Wars" fame. Chewco was a partnership of Enron employees and some undisclosed outsiders. (Who they are and how much they made is a mystery, because Chewco is a private entity.) Chewco's investors didn't have a spare $383 million. So Enron lent Chewco $132 million and guaranteed a $240 million loan that Chewco took out elsewhere. Enron was thus at risk for its own JEDI stake and essentially all of Chewco's. That being the case, it's a mystery why Andersen let Enron keep JEDI off its books. Accounting experts who have looked at this transaction, which Enron disclosed last month, just shake their heads. Andersen has refused to comment, saying it's too early to reach conclusions. Enron has restated its earnings dating back to 1997 because it says JEDI should have been on its books since then. Guess what? The restated profits are far lower than the original ones. 
Now, to the deals that sank Enron. As in JEDI, Enron won't comment. These transactions involve four companies called Raptor. It looks like the Raptors were set up to let Enron use financial gymnastics to get gains from stocks it owned without actually selling them. The major holdings were Rhythms Net Connections, a now bankrupt start-up telecom company, and NewPower Holdings, which competes with established power companies for customers. At their height, Enron's stake in these companies totaled about $2 billion. Friday's value: about $40 million. Enron won't say why it didn't just sell the stock and take its profits. The most logical explanation is tax avoidance. 
Now, the key to Enron's undoing. The company committed to put $1.2 billion of Enron stock into the Raptors to make them more creditworthy. It didn't promise a fixed number of shares--it promised $1.2 billion worth, regardless of the share price. A seriously dumb move for a company that talks about hedging risks. In return for that commitment, the Raptors gave Enron $1.2 billion of promissory notes. Enron put them on its balance sheet as an asset. When a company adds to its assets and nothing else changes, its net worth rises. Hence, Enron marked up its net worth by $1.2 billion. 
But as the stock prices of Rhythms, NewPower and Enron all sank, Enron faced having to fork over a ruinous number of new shares. So Enron paid $35 million to the Raptors' outside investors--yet another mysterious partnership--and liquidated the Raptors. That eliminated the notes, which eliminated the aforementioned $1.2 billion from Enron's net worth. That set off the now famous October run on Enron's credit, which ultimately led to bankruptcy. Now, far too late, Enron says it shouldn't have counted the notes as assets. 
The bottom line: numbers matter. So does truth. Enron was too clever by half. And that's a good way to end up looking stupid.

Lawyers agree on order to safeguard documents 
By ROSANNA RUIZ 
Copyright 2002 Houston Chronicle 
Jan. 23, 2002, 12:35AM
Attorneys for Enron shareholders agreed late Tuesday on a proposed restraining order to safeguard financial documents and investigate their destruction by employees of the company and its auditor, Arthur Andersen. 
Also on Tuesday, FBI agents began an initial investigation into claims that as recently as Monday Enron employees were still shredding documents. 
More than a dozen lawyers representing scores of plaintiffs hammered out the agreement after being told earlier in the day by U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon to draft a temporary restraining order they could agree on. 
The lawyers will submit the order to Arthur Andersen this morning for review. Harmon will make her decision today. 
The proposed order calls for plaintiffs' attorneys to have full access to all Enron-related documents at Andersen offices or some centralized location. 
The attorneys also want Harmon to allow them to expedite the discovery process and depose, among others, Enron Chairman Ken Lay and Andersen's lead auditor for the Enron account, David Duncan, who was fired last week after shredding of documents at the company's Houston office became public. 
"Arthur Andersen tells us unilaterally what's going on and we won't allow that to stand," said Bill Lerach, an attorney for Amalgamated Bank, a plaintiff in the suit against Enron officials. 
The attorneys had filed various motions with Harmon, seeking, among other things, the assignment of U.S. marshals to protect documents at Enron and Andersen, establishing a court-supervised repository for all documents, and allowing computer specialists to try to retrieve deleted electronic data. 
During Tuesday's hearing, Lerach told Harmon that former Enron executive Maureen Castaneda had said she saw documents being shredded as recently as last week, despite a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation that began in October. 
Lerach said Castaneda is only one of a handful of former Enron employees with similar accounts of document shredding and other information. 
"There is no question (Enron) destroyed documents," Lerach said while standing near a box brimming with shredded paper Castaneda gave him. 
"These people began shredding when they knew regulators would soon be coming after them." 
New York-based Amalgamated Bank manages pension funds that lost $17 million in Enron stock. In its lawsuit, Amalgamated alleges that 29 Enron executives and board members sold $1.1 billion in Enron stock over three years knowing that the stock was overvalued. 
Enron attorney Ken Marks said in court that once the allegations about the shredding surfaced, company officials went to the finance department to investigate and found shredded paper in a trash bin. Authorities were then contacted, including the SEC, Justice Department and FBI. 
Marks said Enron officials are unsure what documents were destroyed and that there may be an "innocent" explanation for the shredding. 
"People may have gotten rid of duplicates," Marks said. "We are treating this matter with the utmost seriousness." 
Marks said during Tuesday morning's hearing that FBI agents already had secured the two finance department floors at Enron's downtown office. 
But FBI spokesman Bob Doguim said that two agents arrived at the building only late Tuesday and had not been sent there at Enron's request. 
"We're conducting a logical preliminary investigation," Doguim said. 
In a statement, Enron officials announced that after the shredding allegations surfaced, immediate steps were taken to preserve the "site where the alleged document destruction took place" and that Enron would cooperate fully with federal investigators. 
Andersen officials admitted recently that documents were shredded after the SEC began its investigation. Last week, Andersen said, it fired Duncan in the wake of disclosures that he had ordered the destruction of thousands of documents. 
Andersen's attorney, Rusty Hardin, said at Tuesday's hearing that the firm promptly "self-reported" the shredding. 
Hardin assured Harmon that the "shredding is over" at Andersen and that the firm could be trusted to preserve Enron documents. 
Hardin also said Andersen has begun to collect laptops, Palm Pilots, 3,000 backup computer tapes of existing documents and other materials relevant to the Enron case. 
Hardin also questioned the timing of Lerach's public announcement about papers being shredded at Enron just hours before Harmon was to make her ruling. 
Lerach responded that the publicity had forced Enron's subsequent cooperation with investigators. 
Chronicle reporter Dale Lezon contributed to this story. 


Investigators issue four subpoenas
Two witnesses described as resisting testimony

WASHINGTON -- Problems with two Arthur Andersen witnesses in the unfolding probe of Enron Corp. forced congressional investigators to issue subpoenas Tuesday night for a hearing on the destruction of evidence. 
The House Energy and Commerce Committee subpoenaed Andersen CEO Joseph Berardino, fired auditor David Duncan, attorney Nancy Temple and risk manager Michael Odom. 
While the demands for testimony from Temple and Odom are regarded as "friendly," Berardino and Duncan are throwing up roadblocks, said committee spokesman Ken Johnson. 
"Mr. Duncan's attorneys have indicated he will in all likelihood invoke his Fifth Amendment constitutional right" against self-incrimination, Johnson said. 
A wave of congressional hearings into the collapse of Enron start Thursday with testimony on document destruction scheduled by the oversight and investigations subcommittee of the Energy Committee. 
Andersen fired Duncan last week, saying he orchestrated the destruction of thousands of documents after learning the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating Enron's books. Duncan has since been cooperating behind the scenes with congressional investigators. 
Johnson said House officials regard it as inconsistent for Duncan to provide detailed information to the committee while refusing to testify publicly. 
"There are many things he told the committee that we believe he can repeat under oath without incriminating himself, and we expect him to do so," Johnson said. 
Robert Giuffra, Duncan's attorney in New York, said no decision has been made regarding Duncan's testimony. 
"We have not received a subpoena and we have not made a final decision on whether he will testify," Giuffra said. 
If Duncan refuses to testify, Johnson said remedies under consideration by the committee include charging him with contempt of Congress, the penalty for which can be a year in jail and a $10,000 fine. 
Berardino, meanwhile, also is expected to testify Thursday, but Andersen officials have told the committee he wants to postpone. 
"Andersen has offered to provide the committee with the witness in a week or so, and that is not acceptable to us," Johnson said. "Mr. Berardino found time to appear on Meet the Press last weekend, and we believe he should be obliged to appear before Congress as well." 
Berardino, who has been at the forefront of defending the Chicago-based Big Five accounting firm's conduct in the Enron matter, made an appearance on the Sunday talk show. 
Patrick Dorton, spokesman for Andersen, said Berardino wants to cooperate with the committee. 
"We have directly told the committee we are willing to testify; it's only a question of when," Dorton said. 
The subpoenas follow a long weekend of back-and-forth between the committee and its would-be witnesses, and signal a heightening of tension as the investigation progresses. 
Temple, Andersen's in-house counsel and author of an ambiguous Oct. 12 memo on the company's document-retention policy, is expected to cooperate with the committee summons, Johnson said. 
Odom, Andersen's risk management partner in Houston who was the recipient of Temple's Oct. 12 e-mail, also is considered a friendly witness. 
"They both have agreed to testify before the committee and cooperate with investigators," Johnson said. "Obviously they have certain client confidentiality concerns, and compelling them to testify provides them with some cover from any possible civil litigation by Enron." 
Duncan, Temple and Odom are central figures in the probe of document destruction relating to Andersen's work on behalf of Enron. 
Duncan, who was Andersen's lead partner on the Enron account, is accused by his former employer of ordering a massive destruction of documents beginning Oct. 23, after learning the SEC was investigating Enron's books. 
Duncan, who has said through his attorneys that he followed company policy and did nothing wrong, was fired by Andersen Jan. 15 and began cooperating with congressional investigators the next day. 
The shredding at Andersen stopped after Temple, an in-house lawyer for the firm in Chicago, wrote a memo telling employees to preserve documents. 
Temple's instruction followed word on Nov. 9 that the SEC had subpoenaed Andersen -- weeks after the SEC opened its probe of Enron. 
House investigators want to know whether Andersen's legal department intentionally stalled on issuing the order to preserve documents until after thousands of Enron papers and e-mails had been destroyed. 
Weeks earlier, Temple sent Odom the e-mail referencing the firm's policy on document destruction and retention. 
Coming as it did days before Enron's calamitous Oct. 16 third-quarter earnings report, thee-mail has been the focus of zealous scrutiny by House and Senate investigators tracking Andersen's destruction of evidence. 
"Mike -- It might be useful to consider reminding the engagement team of our documentation and retention policy," Temple wrote in the Oct. 12 memo. "It will be helpful to make sure that we have complied with the policy." 
Temple's e-mail included a link to the company's policy, which outlines which sorts of documents should be destroyed and which retained. 
Four days later, Enron reported a $638 million third-quarter loss and disclosed a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity. 
The devastating report was the start of Enron's stunning free fall, culminating in the largest-ever corporate bankruptcy on Dec. 2. 
Andersen has acknowledged the apparent impropriety of its document shredding, but said Temple's e-mail was aimed at preserving evidence. 
Odom, who is still employed by Andersen, was moved out of management duties in Houston the day Duncan was fired. 
While the destruction of documents is crucial to the probe into Enron's collapse, the central issue is likely to be how involved Andersen management was in creating a corporate structure that misled creditors and shareholders, experts and investigators said. 
The House committee's investigation is one of 10 Enron-related probes under way on Capitol Hill. 
The SEC and Labor Department also are investigating, and the Justice Department has opened a criminal probe. 

COMPANIES & FINANCE THE AMERICAS - Enron judge asks for a plan to stop shredding TRADER'S COLLAPSE ...

COMPANIES & FINANCE THE AMERICAS - Enron judge asks for a plan to stop shredding TRADER'S COLLAPSE ARTHUR ANDERSEN MUST AGREE WITH PLAINTIFFS TO HALT DESTRUCTION OF DOCUMENTS. 
A US federal judge asked plaintiffs in a series of lawsuits against Enron to agree to a plan by today with Arthur Andersen to end the shredding of Enron-related documents by Enron's former accountant.
The plaintiffs, whose representatives filled two tables in the packed courtroom of US District Judge Melinda Harmon, had offered a variety of proposals, some giving Andersen 20 days and some demanding the court take immediate custody of the remaining documents. 
Rusty Hardin, representing Arthur Andersen, said there could be up to 20m documents involved. But plaintiffs were unsympathetic, noting the accounting firm had admitted documents were destroyed, while four to five former Enron employees have confirmed trash bags were routinely filled on the 19th floor of the Enron building with shredded documents. 
One of the employees, Maureen Raymond Castaneda, director of foreign exchange and sovereign risk, seized a cardboard box overflowing with shredded paper when she was laid off last week, Paul Howes, of Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach, told the Financial Times. 
Enron has denied any knowledge of shredding and vowed strict action against anyone involved, saying it had sent out four emails warning staff against destroying evidence. The company sealed off the site where the former employees said the shredding had taken place since November. 
Mark Palmer, Enron spokesman, said the company's lawyer, Bob Bennett, contacted the Department of Justice yesterday and offered to co-operate in any investigation. The department and the FBI immediately sent investigators to the Enron headquarters. 
The plaintiffs pointed repeatedly at the box of shredded paper in making their case. "These are not five-year-old payroll records," said Bill Lerach of Milberg, representing Enron shareholder Amalgamated Bank in the case. "They contain the names of the illicit partnerships. These were current documents." 
He said it was not enough to take the word of Enron and Arthur Andersen executives that no further documents would be destroyed. 
Neil Rothstein of Scott and Scott of Connecticut, which is representing the Archdiocese of Milwaukee Supporting Fund in the case against Enron, said: "This is criminal behaviour. This has to stop now, today. We have no idea whether this is going on right this minute."

Plaintiffs in a series of lawsuits against Enron joined yesterday to ask a federal court judge to order an immediate end to the shredding of documents by Enron and its former accountant Arthur Andersen, and to take custody of remaining documents. 
The plaintiffs noted that Andersen had admitted that documents were destroyed, while several Enron employees confirmed trash bags were filled routinely on floor 19 of Enron's building with shredded documents.
One former Enron employee brought a box of shreddings to the court. "These are not five-year-old payroll records," said Bill Lerach of Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach, representing Enron shareholder Amalgamated Bank in the case. "They contain the names of the illicit partnerships. These were current documents." 
The word of Enron and Andersen executives that no further documents would be destroyed was inadequate, Mr Lerach said, particularly as Andersen had been involved in similar cases, including that of Houston-based Waste Management. 
Andersen agreed to pay the Securities and Exchange Commission $7m in June last year without admitting or denying liability to settle SEC allegations of audit fraud after Waste Management had made the largest profits restatement in US history. Andersen then agreed in November to pay a further $20m to Waste Management shareholders for failing to uncover the problems. 
Neil Rothstein of Scott & Scott of Connecticut, representing the Archdiocese of Milwaukee Supporting Fund against Enron, objected to the suggestion by some plaintiffs that the companies be given 20 days to get records in order. 
"This is criminal behaviour," he said pointing to the box of shreddings. "This has to stop now."

BACK PAGE - FIRST SECTION - Shredding storm may leave Enron's defence in tatters.
By PETER SPIEGEL.

Financial Times

BACK PAGE - FIRST SECTION - Shredding storm may leave Enron's defence in tatters - Revelations raise questions about what group was trying to hide, says Peter Spiegel. 
It has become axiomatic in the world of US political and financial scandals that it is not the original wrongdoing that brings down the powerful - it is the cover-up.
During Watergate, the measure by which all American scandals are judged, the break-in at Democratic party headquarters by a handful of amateur burglars would not have led to President Richard Nixon's resignation. It was his effort to conceal the burglars' ties to his campaign that forced him out of office. 
Similarly, in the past week the escalating Enron controversy has shifted from a complicated inquiry into possibly improper use of accounting principles, to an examination of document-shredding at both Enron and its Andersen auditors - and what they were trying to hide. 
Enron said yesterday that the question had already become the subject of a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe. Following accusations by aformer employee that Enron officials were destroying records, the company's lawyers yesterday asked the Justice Department to send in FBI agents to find out what happened. 
On Capitol Hill, the shredding has also turned perceptions of Enron. Once viewed as a high-flyer with a failed business model and some questionable accounting practices, top investigators are increasingly convinced there was long-term dishonesty at the heart of the company. 
"There's no question in my mind the conduct of Enron and some key figures at Andersen served to deprive investors of information they should have had," Republican James Greenwood, head of one of the most important congressional inquiries, said in an interview this week. "That was done for very unethical reasons." 
When the collapse of Enron, once the US's seventh largest company, remained a question of accounting rules, defences were plausible. Off-balance sheet partnerships are, after all, perfectly legal and they enabled the company to avoid scrutiny of its debts. 
But when the losses were fully disclosed on October 16, investors fled and the giant energy trader sank into bankruptcy. 
The closeness of the relationships between Enron and the partnerships have led to questions about whether they were truly independent companies operating at arm's length, but Enron lawyers have repeatedly pointed out that the practice of using them can be found in any graduate accounting text book. 
Shredding documents, however, is not in any text book. Record destruction by itself can be a crime, particularly when it occurs after the opening of a federal investigation or the filing of a lawsuit. 
Andersen's shredding began in earnest on October 23, the day after Enron publicly acknowledged it had been contacted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the US financial regulator. It continued until November 9, the day after Andersen received an SEC subpoena. 
If former Enron employees are to be believed, Enron itself was shredding documents about the private partnerships just last week - months after the opening of a formal SEC investigation, weeks after the filings of dozens of lawsuits and days after the Justice Department acknowledged it had launched a criminal inquiry into the company. 
Beyond the potential criminality of the record destruction, however, the act of shredding brings with it practical and legal assumptions which call into question the very defences Enron and Andersen have made of their accounting practices. If the partnerships were indeed perfectly legitimate, why the need to destroy documents? 
There are also signals that the shredding revelations have moved the Enron controversy from the realm of hard-core scandal-watchers into US living rooms. Early last week, Gallup issued a poll that showed only 18 per cent of the American public was following Enron news very closely. But yesterday, Maureen Castaneda, the former Enron executive accusing the company of shredding, could be seen everywhere on television news. 
In their defence, Enron and Andersen have insisted there was no company-wide order to destroy papers. Andersen has attempted to point the finger at its Houston office, where it has fired David Duncan, its lead Enron auditor, and disciplined seven colleagues. But it is a defence that has been difficult to maintain following revelations that officials from Andersen's Chicago head office were having frequent discussions with Mr Duncan about Enron's troubles well before the shredding began. 
It is now Enron's turn to make its case, arguing that it sent repeated missives ordering staff to gather documents, as legally required of companies facing litigation. One such e-mail, obtained by the Financial Times and sent on October 31, congratulated employees on their "excellent work" at securing electronic data. "Please err on the side of retention of documents," the e-mail said. 
The shredding storm may prove immaterial for the company, already in bankruptcy. But the revelations could make all the difference when the time comes to judge whether anyone at Enron should land in prison.

Bush defends actions on Enron
President says his mother-in-law was one of collapse's victims 
By BENNETT ROTH 
Copyright 2002 Houston Chronicle Washington Bureau 
Jan. 22, 2002, 9:52PM
WASHINGTON -- President Bush on Tuesday defended his administration's handling of the Enron debacle and portrayed his mother-in-law as a victim of the sudden collapse of the energy company's once-soaring stock. 
Although he visited West Virginia to promote his energy and economic plans, Bush was also forced to address the controversy over Enron, which contributed generously to his campaigns and unsuccessfully sought White House help last fall as its financial situation soured. 
In his first comments on the issue since it was revealed that members of his administration had spoken with Enron chief Ken Lay last fall, Bush said he was not worried that the issue would hurt his reputation or was distracting from his agenda. 
"Our administration has done the exact right thing," Bush said. "There have been a couple of contacts with people in my Cabinet. And my Cabinet officers said, `No help here.' " 
The president said he sympathized with the Houston company's investors, including his mother-in-law, Jenna Welch, who lost nearly all of her investment. 
"What I am outraged about is that employees didn't know all the facts about Enron. My own mother-in-law bought stock last summer, and it's not worth anything now," Bush said. 
The president said his mother-in-law, like other investors, "didn't know all the facts" about the company's financial situation. 
"And that's wrong," Bush said. 
The White House later explained that on Sept. 21, 1999, Welch purchased 200 shares of Enron stock at $40.90 a share for a total investment of $8,180. 
Last Dec. 4 -- two days after the company declared bankruptcy -- Welch sold her Enron stock at 42 cents a share for a total of $84. 
The daily revelations about Enron and the company's contacts with the Bush administration have lately overshadowed the White House's efforts to focus attention on terrorism and the economy. 
Even during the trip to Belle, W.Va., reporters peppered Bush with questions on Enron as he toured a machinery company. 
With a number of congressional committees set to begin hearings on Enron this week, Bush warned lawmakers about dwelling too much on the issue. 
"The Congress needs to stay focussed on the American people," Bush said. "We're running a war. We've got to make sure our homeland is secure. And we've got to make sure people can find work." 
To respond to Enron's problems, Bush has called for more corporate disclosure of financial information and directed the Labor Department to look into tighter regulation of 401(k) retirement accounts. 
But the president has balked at releasing information about all administration contacts with Enron unless there is an accusation of wrongdoing. 
"If somebody has an accusation of wrongdoing, just let me know," he said. The administration recently revealed that Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and Commerce Secretary Don Evans spoke with Lay last fall but concluded nothing should be done to help the company. 
White House economics adviser Lawrence Lindsey also studied the Enron situation and reached the same conclusion. 
Bush also defended the administration's decision not to release records of Vice President Dick Cheney's energy task force, which met six times with Enron officials last year. 
"We laid out the energy report. It's fully disclosed," Bush said. 
But critics, including many Democratic lawmakers and environmentalists, argued that accounts of the task force meetings may reveal how Bush's top contributors in the energy industry, including Enron, played a major role in shaping the energy blueprint. 
Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass, who unveiled an alternative to Bush's energy plan on Tuesday, said that Enron and other companies were allowed an "access bonanza " to Cheney's task force. 
"As a result, those most heavily invested in the current energy system have set a course for the future, which, surprisingly, champions status-quo policies at the expense of new ideas and innovation," Kerry said. 
The Massachusetts senator and possible presidential contender in 2004 said energy policy should focus on raising fuel standards for large vehicles and increasing government incentives for renewable energy like wind and solar power. 
Kerry opposed Bush's proposal for drilling in Alaska's environmentally sensitive Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. 
The president renewed his call for drilling in Alaska in a speech to workers in West Virginia. And deep in the heart of the coal mining belt, Bush drew cheers when he said, "We need to use coal." 
Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer denied the allegation by Democrats and environmentalists that Cheney's task force was largely influenced by the energy industry and said environmentalists such as the Sierra Club had equal access. 
"The president thinks that access should be across the board. And that's why the Sierra Club, for example, as you know, met repeatedly with the energy task force," Fleischer said. 
However, a Sierra Club official said the group met just twice with the administration and only after the energy task force report was unveiled last May. 
"I think Mr. Fleischer is mistaken. Enron had three times the meetings we did," said Daniel Becker, the director of global warming and energy programs at the Sierra Club. 
Becker said Sierra officials met with Cheney on June 6 after the environmental group had blasted the energy task force recommendations. The environmental group also met with administration officials in July to discuss fuel mileage standards for cars.

Andersen Ex-Staffer May Invoke Fifth Amendment on Capitol Hill --- Hearings Approach as FBI Seizes Shredded Papers, Bush Defends Stance

The Arthur Andersen LLP executive fired for destroying documents related to Enron Corp. has told a House committee through counsel that he may invoke his Fifth Amendment right against potential self-incrimination to avoid testifying at a hearing tomorrow, people familiar with the matter say. 
David Duncan, the head of Andersen's Houston office, oversaw the auditing of Enron's books and is at the center of a congressional investigation into the destruction of documents. The shredding continued after the Securities and Exchange Commission began an inquiry during the fall into Enron's accounting practices, which helped force the giant Houston energy company into bankruptcy-court proceedings last month.
"We are sending Mr. Duncan what we call an unfriendly subpoena," said Ken Johnson, a spokesman for the House Energy and Commerce Committee's chairman, Republican Rep. Billy Tauzin of Louisiana. During talks with Mr. Duncan's lawyers, "we were told in all likelihood that he would take the Fifth," Mr. Johnson said. 
A lawyer for Mr. Duncan, Vince DiBlasi, said, "No decision has been made" about whether his client would decline to testify. 
The committee also plans to issue subpoenas to three other Andersen executives, including Chief Executive Joseph Berardino, who had resisted testifying again this week after appearing before another House panel late last year, Mr. Johnson said. A spokesman for Mr. Berardino said, "We have said repeatedly that we will testify. It's only a question of when." 
The other two agreed to testify at tomorrow's hearing before the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee but requested subpoenas, Mr. Johnson said. One of them is Nancy Temple, a lawyer in the firm's Chicago headquarters whose e-mailed reminder of the firm's document-destruction-and-retention policy has been cited by Mr. Duncan in explaining his actions. The other is Michael Odom, head of risk management in Andersen's Houston office, who forwarded Ms. Temple's e-mail to Mr. Duncan. 
Another Andersen executive in the Houston office, meanwhile, pointed a finger yesterday at the Chicago headquarters in explaining the document destruction, according to a person familiar with the House committee's interview with him. That development followed a decision by the Federal Bureau of Investigation to begin looking into the reported shredding of documents at Enron's headquarters in Houston. Mr. Johnson said the committee plans to hold additional hearings into alleged document destruction at Enron "very soon." 
Also yesterday, President Bush offered his most extensive defense to date of his administration's handling of the Enron debacle, saying officials acted properly in refusing to help the company avoid bankruptcy court and portraying his own family as a victim of the collapse. 
Asked about Enron by a reporter while visiting a West Virginia factory to promote his economic agenda, Mr. Bush said Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and Commerce Secretary Donald Evans did the "exact right thing" in refusing to help Enron CEO Kenneth Lay when he called during the fall seeking federal intervention. "My cabinet officers said: `No help here,' " he said. 
Mr. Bush said his mother-in-law, Jenna Welch, bought 200 shares of Enron stock on Sept. 21, 1999, at $40.90 each for a total of $8,180. Mrs. Welch sold them on Dec. 4, two days after Enron filed in bankruptcy court, for 42 cents a share, for a loss of $8,096. "If she had known all the facts, I don't know what her decision would have been," the president said. "But she didn't know all the facts." 
One of Congress's most powerful Democrats weighed in on the scandal, too. "Enron raises serious questions about whether we can contemplate the deregulation of electric utility sales," said Michigan Rep. John Dingell, the Energy and Commerce Committee's ranking minority member, who has longstanding concerns about such proposals. Mr. Dingell also said he favors new rules to restrict the ability of accounting firms to obtain lucrative consulting contracts from companies they audit. 
In Houston, FBI agents began interviewing Enron employees and seized a trash can full of shredded documents. An Enron lawyer, Kenneth Marks, disclosed the FBI action, later confirmed by FBI officials in Washington, at a packed federal court hearing in Houston on one of numerous private-investors suits against the company. 
Plaintiff lawyer William Lerach brought a large cardboard box containing shredded papers that he said had been supplied by a former Enron worker, one of three who asserted in interviews during the week that documents had been destroyed after the SEC began investigating Enron in October. If intended to thwart investigators, document destruction could amount to criminal obstruction of justice. 
The former employees said they saw shredded documents on the 19th floor of Enron headquarters, home to accounting operations at the center of investigations into its collapse. The shreds reportedly contained the names of private partnerships that are the focus of the probes. 
Mr. Marks, the Enron attorney, said company officials "located a single trash can with shredded material." The material was "secured and bagged," and guards were stationed on the 19th and 20th floors, he said. "We don't know what happened here," he added, asserting that there were various possible explanations, some "completely innocent." Enron informed the Justice Department and the SEC about the matter, he said, adding that the Justice Department dispatched the FBI to the scene. 
The House committee's investigators yesterday interviewed another Andersen executive from Houston, Thomas Bauer. Mr. Bauer's account, relayed by a person familiar with his interview, appears to bolster Mr. Duncan's defense. Mr. Duncan has told investigators he oversaw the destruction of Enron documents after receiving Ms. Temple's Oct. 12 e-mail reminder of the company's document-disposal-and-retention policy and immediately halted it after receiving word from her on Nov. 9 that Enron-related documents had been subpoenaed. 
Mr. Bauer told investigators that he assumed document destruction and retention should continue per the policy until told differently by Andersen lawyers. Like Mr. Duncan, Mr. Bauer also said he didn't think it was necessary to preserve all Enron-related documents because Andersen hadn't received a subpoena at that point. 
Congressional investigators are dubious of that defense, especially given that Andersen's Houston office in early November was sent a copy of a directive from Enron executives to its own employees to preserve all documents. "It sounds like they are pleading idiocy," said Mr. Johnson, the Tauzin spokesman. 
Experts say Mr. Duncan appears to be preparing an "advice-of-counsel" defense -- that he had no criminal intent because he was following a policy sent by Ms. Temple, the Andersen lawyer. Reliance on counsel's advice can be "a powerful defense," says Stanley Arkin, a New York attorney not involved in the case. But "if the advice is on its face patently outrageous, patently stupid or violates common sense, it won't excuse the conduct."

Accounting for Enron: Enron Pensions Had More Room at the Top --- Executives' Benefits Grew As Retirement Plans Of Employees Were Cut
By Ellen E. Schultz and Theo Francis
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

At a time when Enron Corp. was cutting back on its employee retirement plans to save money, executive benefits at the energy company kept getting richer. 
Beginning in the 1990s, Enron joined many other U.S. companies in trimming its employee-pension and savings-plan benefits to cut costs. But throughout the same period, Enron also was continuing to offer a lavish set of pension and retirement plans for its top executives.
Those benefits, including a lifelong pension and company-paid insurance premiums for Chief Executive Kenneth Lay, are likely to come under more scrutiny, given the effect of Enron's collapse on the company's employees. The U.S. Department of Labor today will hold a briefing on its investigation of Enron's retirement plan. 
Not only did Enron workers lose their benefits when they lost their jobs, but they also have seen their retirement plans gutted as Enron's stock, which accounted for as much as 60% of the company's 401(k) plan, has dropped to about 50 cents a share from a peak of $90 last year. 
At the same time that employees were locked into much of the Enron stock in their 401(k) plans, executives last year sold shares valued at about $128 million, on top of $486 million in sales in 2000, according to Thomson Financial/Lancer Analytics, which tracks insider transactions. Mr. Lay alone sold shares valued at $29.8 million during that period. 
According to company filings, Enron will pay Mr. Lay a pension estimated at $475,042 a year for life. In addition, as part of an agreement Mr. Lay signed with the company in 1996, it agreed to pay a total of $1.25 million in insurance premiums through 2001 on a $12 million life insurance policy. Other executives have similar pension or insurance agreements with Enron. 
Such so-called "split-dollar" policies are used to channel executive pension benefits into vehicles that executives can tap or pass on to their heirs, mostly tax-free. 
Enron also has a kind of executive 401(k), established in the 1980s, which guarantees executives in the plan minimum returns of 12%. 
In addition, at the time the company was reducing pensions for most of its employees, Enron set up an executive savings plan that lets participating executives contribute 25% of their salaries and 100% of their cash bonuses each year. The participants were guaranteed a 9% return on the first two years of the plan, and they were allowed to put their money into an array of investments -- not just Enron stock. 
While the existence of Enron's executive benefits is outlined in company filings and Securities and Exchange Commission documents, the total cost of the pension and retirement promises to Enron executives is nearly impossible to measure. The cost of the split-dollar arrangements is largely invisible (only the premiums are reported as an expense), and the benefits that accrue in the executive savings plans (also known as deferred-compensation plans) aren't required to be disclosed. An Enron spokesman didn't respond to requests for comment. 
However, filings show that the liability for the executive pensions was $56 million in 2000, or about 8% of the total pension liability for all employees and retirees. 
The documents do show that at the same time that Enron was beefing up retirement benefits for its top executives, it was cutting them for its other workers. 
According to SEC filings, in 1986 Enron set up an employee stock-ownership plan, which bought 8.7 million shares of Enron stock in exchange for a note of $335 million. To pay off much of this debt, the company in January 1987 terminated its overfunded pension plan, and transferred the $230 million in surplus assets, tax-free, to the ESOP. 
Meanwhile, the company set up a new pension plan, transferring into it the assets and liabilities from the old plan; the new plan, though no longer overfunded, was less costly than the old one. 
But even though Enron set up an ESOP and a new pension, this doesn't mean Enron employees were to enjoy benefits from both a pension and an ESOP. That is because Enron created a so-called "floor-offset" arrangement between the pension and the ESOP. That meant the benefits employees earned in one plan essentially erased benefits earned in the other. These arrangements have been used by many companies, including Hewlett-Packard Co. and Airborne Inc. 
A major reason why companies set up these arrangements is to reduce their pension expense. And, indeed, the "offset" contributed to a significant decline in Enron's pension expense, which was $3.6 million in 1987. After the offset was established, instead of an expense, Enron's pension actually contributed $9.6 million to Enron's bottom line in 1988. 
In an unusual step, Enron calculated the ESOP "offsets" based on the price of the stock from 1996 to 2000, when it was trading between $37.75 and $43.44. As previously reported in The Wall Street Journal, it then used the higher locked-in value of the ESOP accounts to permanently cut the value of pensions that employees had earned between January 1987 and January 1995. According to filings, employees had $116 million in ESOP assets at the end of 2000. The assets now are nearly worthless. 
Some Enron employees still will receive their pensions -- albeit at the reduced values. How much employees lost depends on the size of the pensions they had earned, and the value of their ESOP accounts from 1996 to 2000. 
This arrangement comes to light because Enron sought -- and received -- permission from the Labor Department to change its plan in this fashion; company documents also indicate that Mr. Lay's pension wasn't affected by the ESOP offset. 
Not only were the past pensions permanently erased, but the pension going forward, in 1996, also was reduced. At that time, Enron converted the traditional pension to a cash-balance pension, which reduces the benefits build-up for longer-term, older workers. 
This fall, as the company slid toward bankruptcy, Enron said it might freeze the pensions of all employees, and it stopped contributing to the 401(k).

What Enron did to its retirement plans:

-- Used ESOP to get surplus assets from pension plan, tax free.
-- Used ESOP to cut pension expense.
-- Used ESOP to offset pension benefits.
-- Stopped contributing to ESOPs.
-- Converted pension to cash balance pension plan.
-- Froze pension plan of union employees.
-- Locked employees in 401(k) into Enron stock until age 50.
-- In late 2001, stopped contributing to 401(k).

How this affected employees:

-- Pensions earned before 1996 are reduced.
-- Pension earned after 1996 are cut.
-- Pensions for union workers frozen; investment risk increased.
-- ESOPs are now worthless.
-- 401(k)s are devastated.

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE CHAIRMAN
Chief's Words Paint Hands-Off Image, but Actions Offer Different View
By ALEX BERENSON

01/23/2002
The New York Times
Page 7, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

Kenneth L. Lay, the chairman of the Enron Corporation, more than once made a point last year of telling people how little he understood about the finances of the company he has run since 1986. 
In August, Mr. Lay said in an interview that questions about the deals that Enron used to shift debt off its books were ''way over my head.'' In November, Mr. Lay told Chuck Watson, the chairman of Dynegy, which at the time had agreed to buy Enron, that he had never fully read the financial statements Enron filed with federal regulators, according to Mr. Watson.
But if Mr. Lay's comments left the impression that he was a hands-off chairman, a different picture has emerged over the last 10 days as to what Mr. Lay knew about the company's accounting practices and when he knew it. 
Disclosures by Congressional investigators and lawyers suing Enron showed that Mr. Lay helped create and oversee some of the company's suspect financial arrangements. He knew that doubts had been raised about Enron's accounting, even as he encouraged employees to buy Enron shares. About the same time in September and October, Mr. Lay, to avoid facing margin calls as investments in his portfolio lost value, repaid millions in loans from Enron with company stock. 
Now, employees who retained their faith in Mr. Lay even as the company was collapsing are criticizing him for breaching their trust. At worst, experts in securities law say, investigators may view Mr. Lay's professions of ignorance as a deliberate effort to distance himself from Enron's problems. 
''He's got a lot of trouble,'' said James D. Cox, professor of corporate and securities law at Duke University. Mr. Lay is at risk of facing criminal charges of fraud or insider trading, Mr. Cox said. 
''He's going to be spending a lot of time with lawyers; the real fear is on the criminal side,'' Mr. Cox said. ''He could be the next Charles Keating,'' a reference to the savings and loan operator who pleaded guilty to fraud in the 1989 failure of Lincoln Savings and Loan. 
Lawyers for Mr. Lay and Enron did not return calls seeking comment. 
The first blow to Mr. Lay came Jan. 14, when the House Energy and Commerce Committee released a letter showing that as he publicly proclaimed his ignorance of Enron's financial structure in August, he had been warned by Sherron S. Watkins, an Enron vice president, that the company might ''implode in a wave of accounting scandals.'' In response to the letter, Mr. Lay directed Vinson & Elkins, Enron's law firm, to conduct a limited inquiry -- a review that a lawyer for Ms. Watkins has called a whitewash. 
Last Friday, a lawyer representing employees who have sued Enron released a 10-page transcript of an online chat between Mr. Lay and Enron employees on Sept. 26. In the chat, Mr. Lay repeatedly promoted Enron's stock while promising employees that the company's financial reporting was ''legal and totally appropriate.'' 
Congressional investigators, meanwhile, made public the Vinson & Elkins report. It showed that Mr. Lay approved the creation in 1999 of two of the partnerships, LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investments, that have figured prominently in questions about the company's accounting practices. 
In the process, Enron's board, under Mr. Lay's leadership, waived the company's code of ethics to let its chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, run them and profit from them. Losses at those partnerships subsequently forced Enron to erase more than $500 million in shareholders equity, a measure of the company's value. 
Finally, on Sunday, Earl J. Silbert, Mr. Lay's lawyer, acknowledged that Mr. Lay had sold some of his Enron stock back to the company in September and October, while Vinson & Elkins was investigating Ms. Watkins's claims. Details of the sales, repayments of a revolving line of credit extended to Mr. Lay by Enron, do not have to be disclosed to the Securities and Exchange Commission until Feb. 14. 
The revelation that Mr. Lay encouraged Enron employees to buy stock after he was warned about accounting problems may open him to charges of securities fraud, said Joel Seligman, dean of the Washington University School of Law in St. Louis and co-author of an 11-volume treatise on securities law. The fact that he was disposing of shares at the same time could open him to charges of insider trading, Mr. Seligman added. 
''If he knowingly made false statements while he traded stock, he will face criminal liability,'' Mr. Seligman said. Mr. Lay may also face S.E.C. proceedings and already is a defendant in scores of lawsuits. 
Even if Mr. Lay did not know the details of the partnerships used by Enron to inflate its earnings, he could be held criminally liable, Mr. Seligman said. As long as Mr. Lay ''understood why they were created, what they were intended to do,'' he said, ''the fact that he didn't know whether they were created in Panama or the Cayman Islands is a detail that would not be material.'' 
Ira Lee Sorkin, a former director of New York office of the S.E.C. who is now a defense lawyer, cautioned against rushing to judgment. But Mr. Sorkin said the fact that Mr. Lay had disposed of shares after the warning from Ms. Watkins might be difficult for Mr. Lay to explain. 
Other securities lawyers have said the fact that Enron, which presumably had the same information about its prospects as Mr. Lay, acquired his shares might protect him from charges of insider trading. 
But Mr. Sorkin disagrees. ''If he knew of the information that we now suspect he knew about and paid back the company, knowing full well that this stock is going to drop like a lead balloon,'' Mr. Sorkin said, ''then he's going to have an issue.''

Chart: ''Filling in the Details'' Last summer and fall, as energy prices and Enron's stock fell, Kenneth L. Lay, the company's chairman and chief executive, repeatedly reassured investors and employees, urging them to buy stock and telling them that he knew of no problems at the company. Recent disclosures show that he had been told of concerns about Enron's accounting practices and had disposed of millions of dollars worth of Enron stock to meet obligations on his investments. Public Comments and Disclosures AUG. 14 When Jeffrey K. Skilling suddenly resigns as chief executive, citing ''personal reasons,'' Mr. Lay retakes the job. He says, ''Absolutely no accounting issue, no trading issue, no reserve issue, no previously unknown problem issues''are behind the departure. What Was Going On Behind the Scenes AUG. 15 In the wake of Mr. Skilling's resignation, Sherron S. Watkins, a vice president for corporate development, drops a one-page letter in Mr. Lay's suggestion box. In it she raises questions about Enron's accounting practices. Public Comments and Disclosures AUG. 16 Mr. Lay meets with employees to discuss the departure of Mr. Skilling. What Was Going On Behind the Scenes AUG. 20 Ms. Watkins calls a former colleague at Arthur Andersen, Enron's accounting firm, to tell him of her concerns. Mr. Lay exercises options on 25,000 shares at $20.78 with a total value of $519,500. The stock closes at $36.25. A lawyer for Mr. Lay subsequently explains that he used some of the stock to help repay a line of credit from Enron. Public Comments and Disclosures AUG. 21 Mr. Lay sends an e-mail to employees assuring them that the company is on solid footing. He says in the e-mail that ''one of my highest priorities is to restore investor confidence in Enron. This should result in a significantly higher stock price.'' What Was Going On Behind the Scenes AUG. 21 Four Andersen officials, including David B. Duncan, the lead partner on the Enron account, meet to discuss Ms. Watkins's concerns. According to an Andersen memo, they ''agreed to consult our firm's legal adviser about what actions to take'' in regard to Ms. Watkins's accusations. Mr. Lay exercises options on 68,620 shares at $21.56 with a total value of $1,479,447. The stock closes at $36.88. A lawyer for Mr. Lay said he still holds these shares, which are now trading for less than a dollar. AUG. 22 Ms. Watkins meets with Mr. Lay. She gives him a seven-page letter in which she says that Enron may be an ''elaborate accounting hoax.'' She urges him to look into it, but not to involve the company's outside law firm, Vinson & Elkins, because it has potential conflicts of interest. Despite Ms. Watkins's concerns about Vinson & Elkins, the firm is asked to determine if a broad inquiry is necessary to deal with the accusations. It is specifically told not to spend time ''second-guessing the accounting advice and treatment.'' Public Comments and Disclosures SEPT. 26 In an online chat with employees, Mr. Lay says that Enron stock is a good buy and that the company's accounting methods are ''legal and totally appropriate.'' He also says that he and other senior executives are so confident about Enron's prospects that they have bought stock within the previous two months. He concludes by saying that the company's third-quarter results will be very good. OCT. 16 Enron reports a third-quarter loss of $618 million. One day later, it reduces shareholder equity by $1.2 billion to account for transactions involving Enron and some partnerships created by Andrew S. Fastow, Enron's chief financial officer. What Was Going On Behind the Scenes OCT. 15 The lawyers at Vinson & Elkins issue a report saying that Arthur Andersen approved of the practices mentioned in Ms. Watkins's letter. The lawyers conclude that Enron did nothing wrong. Public Comments and Disclosures OCT. 22 The Securities and Exchange Commission opens an inquiry into the partnerships. OCT. 23 In a conference call, Mr. Lay reassures investors and tells them there was no conflict of interest stemming from the transactions with the partnerships. Directors, he adds, ''continue to have the highest faith and confidence'' in Mr. Fastow. The next day, Mr. Fastow is forced out. What Was Going On Behind the Scenes OCT. 26 Mr. Lay calls the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, about Enron's problems. OCT. 28 Mr. Lay talks to Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill. OCT. 29 Mr. Lay asks Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans for help.

Enron creditors seek outside supervision
Court to review options 
By ERIC BERGER 
Copyright 2002 Houston Chronicle 
Jan. 22, 2002, 11:24PM
Lawyers for Enron creditors have asked a U.S. bankruptcy judge to appoint an outsider to supervise the current management or take control of the troubled company. 
The motion, filed Tuesday by the Dallas-based Wiser Oil Company and several other energy companies, contends that Enron executives should no longer be entrusted with leading the company through the biggest bankruptcy ever. 
The action by creditors is backed up by growing evidence of mass shredding of Enron's financial documents. 
"Particularly disturbing are reports that employees of the debtors have been destroying Enron documents since the federal government began investigating their collapse," the motion states. 
On Tuesday FBI agents visited Enron's headquarters following the latest allegations of destruction of documents that could be used as evidence of wrongdoing. 
An Enron spokesperson said the company has posted security guards to restrict access to floors holding financial records. 
Nancy Rapoport, dean of the University of Houston Law Center and an expert in bankruptcy law, believes it is not a coincidence Tuesday's filing by creditors was made as shredding allegations mount. 
"This is a one-for-one response," she said. "They are pissed." 
A hearing on the motion has been set for Feb. 20 in the court of Judge Arthur Gonzalez. 
He is hearing Enron's Chapter 11 bankruptcy case. 
Enron hopes to pare down its assets during the bankruptcy process to pay creditors and emerge as a smaller, profitable company. Removal of its management team may make that a more difficult goal. 
Rapoport believes it's likely at least an examiner will be appointed, but she wouldn't not rule out the possibility of the judge taking the more drastic step of appointing a trustee. 
An examiner is an independent counsel of sorts. 
Such an appointee would have the power to look into what caused Enron's decline and investigate whether the company's officials are acting in the best interest of all the creditors during the bankruptcy process. 
A trustee has much broader powers to run the company, and essentially wrests control of it from current executives. 
"A judge appointing a trustee is telling a debtor we don't trust you a second longer," Rapoport said. "But my instinct is that the bankruptcy judge is going to pick the lesser of the two evils and will appoint an examiner along with giving a strong lecture to the debtors." 
Bankruptcy lawyers for Wiser, who filed the motion, and Enron, who can be expected to challenge it, did not return telephone calls seeking comment Tuesday night. 
The motion presents several arguments in favor of a trustee or examiner. 
First, the motion says access to Enron's financial records has been limited, and it is difficult to get accurate accounts of the company's assets and debt. 
The motion also objects to the sale of assets from Enron's once-robust trading business to UBS Warburg last week. Last week the judge approved the sale, which provided no money up front and will only offer revenue if the business succeeds. 
Finally, the motion cites the civil and criminal investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of Labor, Congress and the Department of Justice. 
Previously, Wiser has announced it stands to lose about $6 million because Enron will not live up to oil and gas hedges -- contracts that were supposed to ensure Wiser would reduce its risk of losses on price fluctuations. 


Security team leaves Enron to form firm
Group to continue working through consulting contract 
By ALAN BERNSTEIN 
Copyright 2002 Houston Chronicle 
Jan. 22, 2002, 11:26PM
Enron's top security team, including four former CIA officers and and ex-FBI agent, has left the company to form a private consulting firm. 
An Enron spokesman said Tuesday the move is unrelated to allegations that executives hid financial problems from investors and that employees shredded documents after the company filed for bankruptcy. 
The new firm, Secure Solutions International, will continue security work for Enron through a consulting contract, which enables it to work for other clients, spokesman Vance Meyer said. 
He said that after Enron filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Dec. 2, the security officers were at risk of being laid off and suggested they form an independent firm with Enron as a client. 
John W. Presley of Katy, a former FBI agent who was Enron's director of corporate security and now leads SSI, could not be reached for comment. 
The Enron team included Presley, four Central Intelligence Agency veterans and a former investigator for the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. 
It acted as an in-house detective agency, probing a variety of allegations of fraud and other kinds of rule-breaking by Enron workers. 
Other duties included guarding executives, securing Enron's computer operations and protecting the corporation's power plant in India. 
Team member David M. Cromley, a former CIA agent who was Enron's director of business analysis, gave Enron executives "detailed and unique information" allowing them to make decisions on "investments, sales of assets, joint ventures and products," according to his business biography. It also says he worked for the CIA in war zones in Somalia, Liberia and Romania and specialized in counter-terrorism operations. 
Andre Le Gallo, a business intelligence consultant in California, said Tuesday that he was the first person recruited from the CIA by Enron. Le Gallo worked at Enron for about five years, ending in December 1999. 
"They were looking for people who knew where the international buttons were," Le Gallo said. 
Enron's international projects included the politically sensitive Indian electricity generation plant. The CIA gathered information about the risks of the project and about British companies that were competing with Enron to build it, The New York Times reported in 1995. 
Le Gallo said the former agents' switch to private consulting is not unusual in the security industry, especially in light of Enron's collapse. 
"I'm sure they moved because they found better things to do than at a sinking firm," he said.

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE OVERVIEW
In Shift, Bush Assails Enron Over Handling of Collapse
By DAVID E. SANGER with DAVID BARBOZA

BELLE, W.Va., Jan. 22 -- Abruptly changing his tone about a company that contributed heavily to his political campaigns, President Bush said today that he was ''outraged'' that the Enron Corporation misled its employees and investors, including his mother-in-law, who he said lost more than $8,000 when its stock collapsed. 
For the first time, Mr. Bush called for government action to force greater corporate disclosure of financial information.
In comments to reporters here before he toured a machinery shop, Mr. Bush also strongly defended how members of his cabinet handled calls for aid from Enron's top executives, summarizing those members' message to the company's leaders as ''no help here.'' 
Mr. Bush's new tone came as the scope of the Enron investigation widened. The company told a federal court in Houston today that on Monday night it had discovered more shredded documents on the 19th floor of its headquarters in Houston, suggesting that employees were destroying potential evidence despite what the company's leaders say were orders to the contrary. 
The shredded remains were turned over to the Justice Department today, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation sealed off part of the headquarters building. 
Meanwhile, the House Energy and Commerce committee said it would issue subpoenas to a recently dismissed partner of Arthur Andersen, the main accounting firm for Enron and the auditor of its questionable financial arrangements. The fired Andersen partner, David B. Duncan, may cite his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination before the committee on Thursday, investigators said. Three others at Andersen, including the firm's chief executive, were also summoned. 
In his comments today, the president never mentioned Enron's chief executive, Kenneth L. Lay, a once-close friend whom he had nicknamed Kenny Boy and who was the largest single contributor to Mr. Bush's campaigns since Mr. Bush entered politics. Nonetheless, by implication the president cut the cord with Mr. Lay today, saying, ''What I'm outraged about is that shareholders and employees didn't know all the facts about Enron.'' 
''My own mother-in-law bought stock last summer, and it's not worth anything now,'' he said of Jenna Welch, Laura Bush's mother. 
Mr. Bush added later: ''She didn't know all the facts. And a lot of shareholders didn't know all the facts. And that's wrong.'' 
Republican strategists said Mr. Bush's changed tone reflected a political calculation by the White House as Congressional hearings on the company's collapse begin this week. They said the administration was determined not to allow Democrats to portray Enron as a problem only for Republicans. 
''The dynamic over Enron cannot be that Democrats are against Enron and for reform, and we're defending Enron and against reform,'' said one strategist who is close to the White House but who would not allow his name to be used. ''What Enron did is outrageous, and if you don't move to correct it, it becomes an indictment of the free market. The Republican Party is the free market party. And we have to demonstrate our desire to make the market fair and to crack down on abuse.'' 
Bill Dal Col, a Republican strategist, said Mr. Bush's comments were an appropriate response to the widening disclosures about Enron. 
''When you've got a crisis that's growing like this -- every time you turn the page there's a new chapter of hocus-pocus accounting -- the stronger the outrage has to be,'' Mr. Dal Col said. 
After Mr. Bush spoke, the White House corrected the president on the timing of his mother-in-law's investment. Mrs. Welch bought 200 shares of Enron on Sept. 21, 1999, for $40.90 a share, the White House said, for a total investment of $8,180. She sold her holdings on Dec. 4, two days after the company declared bankruptcy, for 42 cents a share, meaning her investment had plummeted to $84. 
The White House did not say if any other members of Mr. Bush's family had held Enron stock. Some of his close aides did, but they were forced to divest their holdings shortly after they joined the administration, under federal ethics rules. 
When Mr. Bush last spoke publicly about Enron on Jan. 11, he distanced himself from Mr. Lay, saying he recalled that the Texas executive had also supported Mr. Bush's rival, Ann Richards, for governor of Texas -- and expressed concern for Enron's workers. Mr. Bush also called for an investigation into ''the whys of Enron,'' focusing on changing rules to protect the life savings of workers. But in those comments, he never criticized the company or its executives, many of whom were his political and social friends in Texas. His tone suggested that he viewed Enron's collapse as an example of the ups and downs of capitalism, rather than an effort to defraud. 
Today, after a stream of revelations about the company's efforts to hide its debts and overstate its profits, Mr. Bush seemed angry -- both at the company and at suggestions that his administration had been unduly influenced by a major contributor. 
''If somebody has got an accusation about some wrongdoing, just let me know,'' he told reporters. 
''It's like when I talked with Don Evans and O'Neill,'' he said, referring to his commerce secretary and Paul H. O'Neill, the secretary of the Treasury, ''they told me they had spoke to Enron. I said, 'Tell the people what you did.' '' 
He brushed aside any suggestion that Enron officials, in several meetings with Vice President Dick Cheney and his energy task force, had influenced the administration's energy policy. ''We laid out the energy report,'' Mr. Bush said. ''It's fully disclosed.'' 
Mr. Bush called for action to prevent a recurrence of the Enron debacle, saying, ''Our government must do something about it.'' 
But he never elaborated on how oversight of companies like Enron, or their accounting firms, should change. 
And just minutes later, addressing workers at the Walker Machinery Company here about the economy and his campaign against terrorism, Mr. Bush returned to one of his favorite themes: that the government overregulates the economy and should let up on American companies so they are freer to act as they see fit. He said the government should ''not overregulate those who are trying to create work.'' 
As Mr. Bush spoke today, new details were emerging about shredded documents at the company's headquarters. Enron said in federal court that a second batch of shredded documents was found on Monday night in a trash receptacle at the company's headquarters. 
Enron officials said they knew nothing about the destruction of the documents and they insisted that the company had repeatedly ordered employees not to destroy documents after a series of lawsuits and federal investigations began looking into the collapse of the company last October and November. Destroying documents that are relevant to those investigations or to lawsuits against the company and its executives would be a crime. 
But lawyers representing shareholders and employees said they doubted that explanation. ''This cannot be tolerated,'' said William Lerach, an attorney in a class-action suit against Enron and Andersen, pointing to a box of shredded Enron documents that he brought to the court hearing. ''The integrity of the civil litigation system has been insulted.'' 
He and others asked Judge Melinda Harmon of Federal District Court in Houston to seize the company's documents and put them under the guard of United States marshals. They argued that Enron and Andersen could not be trusted to turn over valuable evidence related to the case. 
The court hearing came a day after a former Enron employee, Maureen Castaneda, said that she had found a box of shredded documents on the 19th floor of the Enron headquarters, the same floor where the company found additional evidence of shredding on Monday night. Ms. Castaneda, who was a director of foreign exchange at Enron until she was fired last week, said she took a box home to use the confetti as packing material. She said the box contained shards of paper referring to some of the secret Enron partnerships that are at the center of the accounting scandal that forced the company into bankruptcy protection. 
Efforts to reach Ms. Castaneda today were unsuccessful. The company said that it was now cooperating with federal investigators and that company lawyers had interviewed several workers on the 19th floor about document shredding. 
''Until yesterday, the company believed the process was working and was completely observed,'' Kenneth Marks, a lawyer for Enron, said today. ''We don't know what happened here. There could be completely innocent explanations for this.'' 
Rusty Hardin, a lawyer for Andersen, criticized the opposing lawyers for drumming up publicity with television interviews Monday night, a day ahead of the scheduled hearing. Mr. Hardin said lawyers for Andersen were working hard to preserve and recover documents. 
''We are not suicidal,'' he said, gesturing toward Judge Harmon. ''If we were shredders and not preserving documents you could run us out of business.'' 
In an interview today, an Enron employee who works on the 19th floor confirmed that shredded material had filled a plastic bin beside the shredding machine for several weeks. He said that he had never seen anyone actually doing the shredding but that he had assumed it was taking place. 
''It was obvious there was paper in the shredder,'' he said. ''Probably recently.'' 
He said the 19th floor is divided between a research division and payroll and accounting departments. The employee, who spoke on the condition that his name not be used, said he had not considered the evidence of shredding in a common room to be significant because accounting and payroll employees routinely destroy documents. 
And he said that while company executives had sent three e-mail messages in October outlining restrictions on shredding, he had not interpreted those messages to be blanket prohibitions but instead were limited to documents related to the investigations. He said a fourth e-mail message sent on Jan. 14 was emphatic that all shredding cease. 
Document shredding seems likely to be a main topic of the coming Congressional hearings. Tonight, the House Energy and Commerce Committee, preparing for its hearing on Thursday on shredding of documents by Andersen, Enron's auditors, was expected to subpoena four current or former Andersen officials: Joseph F. Berardino, the chief executive; Michael C. Odom, a partner in the firm's Houston office who was relieved of management responsibilities last week; Nancy Temple, a lawyer in the firm's Chicago headquarters; and Mr. Duncan, the lead partner on the Enron account. 
Ms. Temple and Mr. Odom are expected to testify willingly, but Mr. Berardino and Mr. Duncan are resisting, investigators say, and Mr. Duncan may invoke his Fifth Amendment right, they said. 
''Duncan remains an extremely recalcitrant witness who believes he ought to be able to take the Fifth by fax,'' said Representative James C. Greenwood, the Pennsylvania Republican who is chairman of the subcommittee that will hold the hearing. If Mr. Duncan does not at least show up to exercise his Fifth Amendment rights, Mr. Greenwood said, the subcommittee would consider citing him for contempt of Congress.

ENRON'S COLLAPSE
Kind Words for Andersen
By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

The New York Times
Page 7, Column 2
c. 2002 New York Times Company

WASHINGTON, Jan. 22 -- Last week, the Enron Corporation fired its longtime auditor, Arthur Andersen, during the company's accounting scandal. But not so long ago, Enron's chairman, Kenneth L. Lay, had only nice things to say about his auditors. 
Andersen's ''expertise and professional skepticism,'' Mr. Lay explained in September 2000, had helped ''improve the overall control environment within'' Enron.
Mr. Lay made the comments in a letter to Arthur Levitt, who was then chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, to persuade Mr. Levitt to back off on plans to improve auditor independence. Specifically, one of Mr. Levitt's initiatives would have prohibited a company's external auditor from also performing internal audits, as Andersen continued to do for Enron. 
Mr. Lay, in his letter, explained that Mr. Levitt's proposals were ''troubling'' because Enron had found the existing setup to be cheaper and more efficient. But, as is now understood, it is not clear that the arrangement worked so well. In November, Enron admitted overstating its profits since 1997 by nearly $600 million -- one of a series of damaging disclosures that led to its bankruptcy filing. 
Today, Mr. Levitt said in an interview that the issue Mr. Lay objected to ''goes right to the heart of what we were driving at, what we were trying to eliminate.'' The most egregious conflict, he said, ''was the performance of internal audits by the external auditor; he's auditing himself.'' 
Had Enron had separate auditors doing their internal and external reviews, Mr. Levitt added, other auditors ''might have found something that Andersen wasn't able to uncover.'' 
At the bottom of Mr. Lay's letter is Enron's trademarked motto, which, with the benefit of hindsight, is quite prescient: ''Endless possibilities.''

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE LAWYER
Seeking Top Berth In Pursuit Of Enron
By LESLIE WAYNE

01/23/2002
The New York Times
Page 6, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

WASHINGTON, Jan 22 -- The lawyer William Lerach was all over the television news today as he lugged a large carton of shredded Enron documents to the courthouse in Houston. Amid a sea of microphones, Mr. Lerach gave the impression he was leading the charge for angry shareholders in their legal battle against Enron. 
In reality, it is a job he wants but does not yet have. Instead, Mr. Lerach, perhaps the most famous and flamboyant lawyer for shareholders, is engaged in a pitched three-way battle to be named chief legal counsel for all Enron shareholders, a job that could end up netting legal fees in the hundreds of millions of dollars for the firm selected.
Just who will be named chief counsel for the class-action suit will be determined by a federal judge next month. 
In the meantime, Mr. Lerach is campaigning, appearing on morning talk shows and making dramatic statements to reporters on the courthouse steps as he filled the airwaves today. 
He wants the job so badly that he has even jettisoned some clients, most famously, Amalgamated Bank of New York, in the hopes of staking his fortune with even bigger ones -- one of the criteria for deciding the lead counsel. 
''Bill Lerach puts himself in the forefront in terms of publicity and fees and everything else,'' said James M. Finberg, a lawyer with a San Francisco firm that is also vying to be named chief counsel. ''But the decision of who becomes lead counsel will not be made by who has the most press attention, but will be made by a judge.'' His firm's clients include the City of New York pension fund and a State of Florida pension fund. 
In the world of shareholder litigation, Mr. Lerach, who did not return calls for comment, is well known. He has won over a billion dollars for shareholders in two big financial scandals involving junk bonds and savings and loans, and brought frivolous cases like litigation over the lip-synching duo, Milli Vanilli. 
Mr. Lerach has made a personal fortune and gained the lasting hatred of corporate America by bringing more than 600 suits against companies whose stock price has dropped. His firm, Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach, accounts for about half of all shareholder suits against corporations and has won $6 billion for its clients. 
For this Mr. Lerach earned the name the ''king of strike suits,'' and corporations talk about having been ''Lerached.'' 
His firm once agreed to pay $50 million to settle a case in which someone he sued accused him of abusing the legal system and a federal jury agreed. 
''He is a controversial figure of historic dimensions,'' said John Coffee, a securities law professor at Columbia University. ''Those who do not like him say he behaves as an extortionist, is threatening and shakes people down. Others say he is more zealous than the lazier plaintiffs' attorneys. He is the most controversial figure in a field of litigation known for its egos and flamboyant types.'' 
Some say Mr. Lerach's boldest move to date may be in giving the impression in the Enron case that he already has the job he wants: ''Lerach is running around like it's his case,'' said one law school professor, who insisted on not being identified. ''Why is this man smiling? He thinks he has the case, and it is not clear that he does.'' 
In reality there are three legal teams vying to be selected as the lead counsel for the shareholders -- mainly large pension funds who bought Enron shares, but also individual investors. Mr. Lerach's big client is the University of California Regents, which has lost about $144 million. Another is Mr. Finberg's firm, Lieff Cabraser Heimann Bernstein, whose two clients, the New York and Florida pension funds, have a combined total of $440 million in losses and which feels it has something extra. ''We have a very sympathetic group,'' Mr. Finberg said. ''We represent a lot of the families of people who died in the World Trade Center.'' 
A third group is composed of public pension funds from Georgia, Ohio, Washington and Alabama and is represented by a law firm in Delaware and one in Atlanta. This group is claiming losses of $330 million. Lawyers for the two firms, Grant & Eisenhofer and Chitwood & Harley, did not return calls. 
Under federal securities reform legislation enacted in 1995, the criterion for selecting a lead lawyer was changed. Rather than the firm that filed a class-action case first (one of Mr. Lerach's specialties), the lawyer who represents the plaintiffs with the greatest losses, among other factors, is now favored. 
The lead lawyer's firm decides on the legal strategy, directs all other lawyers and gets the biggest slice of the fees, as well as determines how much lawyers for the other plaintiffs will be paid. These fees can run into the hundreds of millions -- the $3.2 billion class-action settlement against the Cendant Corporation is expected to net legal fees of over $270 million. 
''The lead law firm does most of the work and gets most of the fees,'' said Brian Borders, a spokesman for the Association of Publicly Traded Companies, which represents small and midsize companies. ''The fees in the Enron case could be in the hundreds of millions. It is going to be the grandaddy of all securities class-action cases and that will dictate the size of the fees.'' 
At the moment, Mr. Lerach is doing some fancy footwork to get the lead position. In court today, he argued that the selection of the lead counsel should be changed from the law firm whose clients, as a group, suffered the biggest losses to the firm with the single client who has lost the most. By the first calculation, Mr. Lerach's firm would be in third place. 
By the second calculation, he contends, he would be in first place, as he says the California Regents' $144 million was the single largest loss. While the Florida pension fund lost more, $300 million, Mr. Lerach argued that Florida should be disqualified as a lead plaintiff because it brought more class-action lawsuits over the last three years than allowed by federal law. But lawyers for the State of Florida say this law does not apply to institutional investors. 
To back up his legal theory that the lawyer for the single-biggest plaintiff should get the nod, he asked his other client, Amalgamated Bank, to step down, and the bank, with only $10 million in losses, agreed. 
''This is something that we agreed to do so that Bill Lerach could become the lead attorney on the case,'' said Melissa Moye, chief economist for Amalgamated Bank, who reasoned that if stepping back was the only way to get Mr. Lerach selected to represent the whole class of shareholders, it would. 
''We did this by mutual consent. We want the California Regents to be named as the lead plaintiff,'' Ms. Moye said. 
In fact, some see Mr. Lerach's action's today, especially his courting of the press, as a smart marketing move intended to draw even bigger clients to him. 
''He's been courting the pension funds by saying, you ought to pick Milberg Weiss as the lead counsel,'' said Mr. Borders of the publicly traded companies group. ''It's all about marketing.''

Politics & Policy
Cast Prepares for Congressional Curtain to Rise on Enron Scandal
By Jackie Calmes and Tom Hamburger
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

WASHINGTON -- Congress returns for a new year today with its agenda once again reshaped by events: The Enron Corp. scandal has joined war and recession on center stage, commanding lawmakers' legislative attention and throwing yet another variable into their election-year calculations. 
Some lawmakers, of course, will be more prominent than others. Since Congress recessed a month ago, Enron and its now-fired auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, have faced a torrent of reports alleging financial shenanigans and paper-shredding involving both. Now, Congress watchers need a cheat-sheet to keep track of the myriad House and Senate committees probing the mess. What follows is a guide to those who will play lead roles.
-- Rep. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin. For all of Democrats' hopes that Enron could tar the company's political favorites -- chiefly President Bush and his party -- this Louisiana Democrat-turned-Republican so far has been the most aggressive congressional prosecutor. He has been responsible for recent disclosures on potentially criminal document destruction. 
Mr. Tauzin has the right platform, as chairman of the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee. He is inclined to use it: A savvy politician and media performer, he is a populist sympathetic to Main Street, not Wall Street, and to independent oil and gas companies rather than corporate behemoths. 
A prodigious fund-raiser, Mr. Tauzin has pocketed checks from both companies: $57,000 from Andersen since 1989, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, and $6,464 from Enron. Unlike some other politicians of late, his spokesman says he won't be returning any of it. 
-- Rep. John Dingell. The pugnacious Michigander is Mr. Tauzin's Democratic opposite at the Energy and Commerce Committee. He long headed the panel, and sometimes acts -- and is treated -- as if he still does. 
"Big John," as colleagues call him, will focus on document shredding and other potential evidence of obstruction of justice. Also watch for him to use Enron hearings to raise longstanding concerns about the perils of energy deregulation, formerly Enron's top legislative priority, and about auditors' independence. Of Andersen's role as both Enron consultant and auditor, he said in an interview, "It is impossible for any intelligent man to look at this and not come to the conclusion that this is a serious conflict of interest." 
His take since 1989: $9,000 from Enron, $6,500 from Andersen. 
-- Rep. Henry Waxman. The California Democrat has been far ahead of the pack on Enron, though he is handicapped by being in the House's minority party -- and thus lacking the GOP chairmen's power to set hearings and subpoena witnesses. The liberal activist set up a Web site in December for whistle-blowers. He and Mr. Dingell triggered an investigation by Congress's nonpartisan General Accounting Office into the secret deliberations of Vice President Dick Cheney's task force with energy-industry representatives -- notably Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay -- as Mr. Cheney drafted the administration's energy plan. 
Mr. Waxman will be an interrogator on Energy and Commerce, but his own Enron-Andersen probes have been from his perch as top Democrat on the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee. His tenaciousness contrasts with the unusually low profile of Indiana Rep. Dan Burton, the panel's GOP chairman who was arch-inquisitor of the Clinton administration. Privately, White House aides have warned that Mr. Waxman could end up as "the next Dan Burton," reflecting the widespread view that Mr. Burton's tenacity backfired. Democrats scoff. 
Mr. Waxman's take from the companies, according to federal records: 0. 
-- Sen. Joseph Lieberman. The Connecticut Democrat gavels the opening of hearings of his Senate Governmental Affairs Committee tomorrow. His celebrity is enhanced by his creditable, if losing, run for vice president in 2000, but his motives inevitably will be viewed through the prism of 2004's presidential politics. 
Many Democrats had feared the sober centrist would be reluctant to use his influential chairmanship to plumb the Enron scandal; some still question how aggressive he will be. An early draft of Mr. Lieberman's opening statement suggests he will play the tough but fair "big picture" investigator, warning against leaping to conclusions and focusing on what government regulators could have done. 
Mr. Lieberman has satisfied Democratic activists by vowing to press for information on the Cheney task force's Enron contacts. He got an assist last weekend from his committee's top Republican, Sen. Fred Thompson of Tennessee, who said the White House should "get the information out." 
Mr. Lieberman received $11,500 from Andersen and $2,000 from Enron since 1989. Mr. Thompson accepted $8,800 from Andersen, according to the center's records, and nothing from Enron. 
-- Sen. Carl Levin. At the Governmental Affairs Committee, Mr. Levin's investigations subcommittee actually will take the lead in digging for insider details about Enron's spectacular flame-out, which culminated in the largest U.S. bankruptcy filing ever. Mr. Levin received nothing from Enron, according to the center's records, and $3,200 from Andersen. 
The Michigan Democrat's panel already has sent out 51 subpoenas to Enron and Andersen officials. Among them is one to Wendy Gramm, a member of the Enron board's audit committee and wife of Texas Sen. Phil Gramm -- the Senate's second-largest recipient of Enron funds, with $97,350 since 1989. Mr. Gramm's personal and political ties to Enron raised questions about his role in coming hearings of the Senate Banking Committee, where he is the top Republican; yesterday, his office said he will skip hearings that focus on the company. The panel, led by Democratic Sen. Paul Sarbanes of Maryland, also will be looking at financial aspects of the scandal. 
Separately, the tax-writing House Ways and Means and Senate Finance panels have jurisdiction over a number of issues raised in the financial debacle -- and the power to probe Enron's Internal Revenue Service records. The lead actors at Ways and Means have been relatively mute. Montana Sen. Max Baucus, the Finance chairman, this week is asking Enron to voluntarily release income-tax records. That move could signal the start of a fuller committee investigation into Enron's use of offshore entities as tax shelters, its preparation of tax returns, and overall compliance with federal tax laws. 
Mr. Baucus has taken $3,200 from Enron, but a spokesman says he will give the sum to a fund for Enron workers.

Unaccountable in Washington

AUSTIN, Tex. -- The first of at least 11 Congressional hearings into the largest corporate bankruptcy in United States history begins tomorrow. Although Enron's executives and accountants have much to answer for, they can be forgiven for cracking a wry smile when members of Congress begin lecturing them on their dereliction of duty: Congress itself, as much as Enron and Arthur Andersen, bears some responsibility for the current state of affairs. 
The story begins in the 1970's and 1980's, when members of Congress, most from oil-producing states, pressured the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission not to demand tougher standards for financial reporting in the petroleum industry. At the time, it was clear that the lawmakers were serving corporate interests, not those of investors. Now it's clear that this was only a warm-up act.
While the F.A.S.B. is a private organization financed by industry, the board's authority comes from the S.E.C. requirement that corporations follow the standards it sets. If Congress is unhappy with an F.A.S.B. standard, it can pass a law directing the S.E.C. to ignore it. 
From 1991 to 1994, members of Congress prevented the F.A.S.B. from issuing a standard that would have forced companies to take a charge against earnings when they issue employee stock options. Congress persisted in this course of action even though investors like Warren Buffett and the S.E.C. itself supported the F.A.S.B.'s initiative, saying options should be counted as an expense on earnings statements in the same way other forms of compensation are. 
The driving forces behind the Congressional opposition were major industrial corporations and special-interest groups representing small, high-tech companies. If companies counted options as compensation, they argued, earnings would decline and stock prices would suffer. Members of both houses called for hearings and introduced bills that would have hamstrung the F.A.S.B. in its attempt to bring clarity to this important issue. In fact, in 1994, 88 members of the Senate voted for a ''sense of the Senate'' resolution in which they informed the F.A.S.B. that its proposed standard would have ''grave economic consequences'' for entrepreneurial ventures. 
At one point in the debate, Senator Joseph Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut and now chairman of the committee that will convene tomorrow's first hearing, introduced a bill that would have effectively destroyed the F.A.S.B.'s authority to set standards for financial reporting. The bill, proposed as an amendment to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, would have required the S.E.C. to vote on every statement issued by the board. In the face of this proposed legislation, the F.A.S.B. had no choice but to drop its proposal to amend the way options are accounted for. 
In the 1997-1998 session, the F.A.S.B. tried to rewrite the rules affecting derivatives, financial devices whose worth is determined by the value of another entity, whether it be government bonds, pork bellies or, as was the case with some of Enron's derivatives, the price of natural gas. Derivatives are complicated and risky, and the F.A.S.B. in its new rules sought to ensure that corporate financial statements accurately reflected those risks. This time, in the face of opposition from members of both parties in Congress, the F.A.S.B. was able to withstand the pressure. It issued its new standards in 1998. 
But adversity quickly followed this minor success. In the 1999-2000 session, members of Congress once again intervened, this time to place barriers in the path of proposed standards on mergers and acquisitions and the way corporations involved in them account for the value of intangible assets like good will. The F.A.S.B. had wanted to change the way companies account for some costs in such deals, forcing them to write them off over a shorter period of time. Companies opposed the change, saying the increased costs would reduce their earnings, and lobbied Congress against the change. In the face of such opposition, once again the F.A.S.B. was required to make a strategic retreat. 
Yet the true cost of all this Congressional meddling is even greater than the sum of its parts. Taken collectively, these proposed standards would have merely tweaked the existing accounting model. What is necessary is a comprehensive overhaul of the model itself. The model was designed for the industrial era. It worked fine when plants, equipment, inventories, accounts receivable -- stuff you could see and touch -- were what made a company tick. It fails miserably when the critical resources of a firm are software, intellectual capital, brand names and fiscal wizardry. 
Few accountants will deny that the F.A.S.B. was unable to close accounting loopholes as rapidly as Enron and Andersen created them. And few will deny that fast and loose reporting practices are all too common in the corporate world. 
Yet Congress has not allowed even a modest tweaking. Imagine, then, the outcry if the F.A.S.B. actually got serious about true reform of the current accounting model. Among the changes it might propose are restoring to the balance sheet many liabilities, like certain kinds of leases, that are now considered ''off balance sheet''; adjusting reported earnings for changes in current prices of assets; and recognizing and amortizing the many intangible assets that are currently not even seen on balance sheets. 
Each of these changes could have helped regulators and investors see the Enron-Andersen debacle coming, or even helped to prevent it. By sending a message that such changes are not remotely welcome or politically possible, Congress paved the way for the current crisis. Congressional involvement in financial standard-setting has been pure politics, fueled by a system of campaign financing that distorts the pursuit of the nation's legislative agenda. If members of Congress are sincere about identifying and correcting weaknesses in the standards used for financial reporting, then they should investigate the old-fashioned way: follow the money. They are likely to find a trail that leads to the nearest mirror.

Bush Makes Recess Appointment to SEC

01/23/2002

WASHINGTON -- Amid a flurry of last-minute recess appointments, President Bush put a top accounting-firm executive on the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is playing a lead role in the investigation of Enron Corp.'s collapse. 
Mr. Bush, using his power to avoid Senate confirmation of top government officials, tapped Cynthia A. Glassman of Ernst & Young to serve at the SEC at least until year end. The SEC, which has proposed revamping oversight of the accounting industry, is investigating Arthur Andersen LLP's auditing of Enron's books and disclosures that the accounting firm shredded documents related to its work on behalf of the energy company, which has filed for bankruptcy.
Ms. Glassman, a Republican, has worked at Ernst & Young since 1997 and was the firm's director of commercial-bank risk management for two years. 
Perhaps trying to lessen Democrats' ire, Mr. Bush reappointed Isaac Hunt, who was originally appointed by former President Clinton in 1996. Mr. Hunt, whose term expired more than a year ago, has seen his stock rise of late, as Republicans have been unable to settle on an alternative Democratic replacement. 
In other appointments, Mr. Bush put Michael J. Bartlett, director of labor law policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, on the National Labor Relations Board. He also named Iowa State Sen. JoAnn Johnson and Deborah Matz, executive officer of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, to the National Credit Union Administration's board.

Enron debacle could bring problems for Gramms
Senator could face conflict of interest if his wife is questioned by lawmakers 
By DAVID IVANOVICH 
Copyright 2002 Houston Chronicle Washington Bureau 
Jan. 22, 2002, 9:35PM
WASHINGTON -- Wendy Gramm, a member of Enron's board of directors, stands to lose more than $686,000 in retirement funds because of the company's bankruptcy filing. 
Besides being an unsecured creditor, the one-time head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission likely will be called to testify before one of a myriad of congressional panels looking into the Enron debacle. 
And as a member of the board's audit committee, Gramm is sure to be questioned about what and when she knew about the company's financial problems. 
Her husband, Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said Tuesday that he will not take part in congressional investigations into Enron's collapse, but will join the discussions about what should be done to avoid similar debacles. 
"I'm not going to recuse myself on issues that are relevant to all business," said Gramm, the ranking Republican on the Senate Banking Committee. 
That panel, chaired by Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., plans to hold a hearing Feb. 12 to examine accounting and retirement investment issues raised by Enron's collapse. 
Many current and former Enron employees lost their life savings because their 401(k) retirement plans were wholly invested in Enron stock. 
Lawmakers will examine proposals that would force participants in retirement plans to diversify their portfolios. 
Such issues, Gramm said, "are not Enron-specific." 
Sarbanes agrees that Gramm should be able to take part in committee activities, a spokesman said. 
But some critics contend Gramm will not be able to draw the line neatly between Enron issues and those that apply to all businesses. 
"He should recuse himself, given that his wife is on the board and his wife, potentially, could be in serious trouble," said Tyson Slocum of consumer activist Ralph Nader's Public Citizen. 
As a member of the audit committee with strong government and academic credentials, "she's got some serious explaining to do," added Slocum, who serves as research director for Public Citizen's Critical Mass Energy and Environment Program. 
Larry Noble, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics, a self-styled government watchdog group, said he doesn't know how Gramm can avoid creating at least the appearance of a conflict of interest. 
Even when discussing issues such as accounting changes and 401(k) retirement rules, Noble said, "Enron is going to be the 3,000-pound elephant sitting in the middle of the room." 
Wendy Gramm first joined Enron's board in 1993, just weeks after stepping down as head of the federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission. While at the commission, she had championed deregulation of commodities trading, including energy. 
The Gramms contend they have separate business lives and do not discuss such work-related concerns at home. 
"We talk about my taking out the garbage and Texas A&M football," Phil Gramm said. 
Back in 1998, Wendy Gramm sold $207,000 in stock -- her entire Enron holdings -- and asked the company to pay her for her board work in cash payments to a deferred-compensation plan, rather than in Enron shares. 
The idea was to eliminate any conflict-of-interest problems, so that her husband could freely participate in the debate over the nation's energy policy. 
Wendy Gramm sold that stock, her husband points out, before Enron's stock price rocketed up in 1999 and 2000. Her deferred-compensation fund is now tied up in the Enron bankruptcy. 
The conflict-of-interest issue resurfaced in December 2000, when lawmakers, with Sen. Gramm's blessing, approved the Commodity Futures Modernization Act. 
That bill essentially codified regulations pushed at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission as far back as 1989, when Wendy Gramm was a member. The measure exempted energy and metals commodities trading from government regulation. 
The language of interest to Enron, Sen. Gramm noted, was written by lawmakers in the House. The Senate Agriculture Committee, which had jurisdiction over that portion of the bill, did not change the House language. 
Gramm, at that time chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, objected to the bill because of some banking provisions he found unacceptable. Under the rules of the Senate, Gramm held up progress on the bill for four months. 
Wendy Gramm, who heads a regulatory studies program at George Mason University in Virginia, had done her own critique of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's work and raised separate objections to the legislation. 
Sen. Gramm does not remember being lobbied directly by Enron on the Commodity Futures Modernization bill, although he was aware of a letter Enron Chairman Ken Lay had written to House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., in September 2000, urging passage of the measure. The bill, Lay wrote, would provide "critical legal certainty" for Enron's commodity-trading businesses. 
Eventually, Gramm and the Clinton administration reached a compromise on the banking provisions and the measure was attached to a spending bill. 

Auditor Independence: The SEC Chairman Doesn't Get It
By Roger Lowenstein

01/23/2002
The Wall Street Journal
A22
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey Pitt doesn't get it. "Auditor independence is not the cause of the problems that we are witnessing," Mr. Pitt insisted recently. The "problems," of course, refer to Enron, and "the bigger issues" in that unhappy saga relate to "the quality of our disclosures, the penetrability [or lack thereof] of financial reports." 
No doubt about it, Mr. Pitt, Enron's reports were lacking in quality and impenetrable to boot. And anyone who took weeks or months to plough through them would have figured it out. Especially if they had access to Enron's books, had been party to explanations on how its affiliated partnerships related to the mothership, and had maybe gotten invited to dinner at Ken Lay's house.
But most of us in the public didn't. That's why we rely on public accountants to audit financial statements and certify that they are in keeping with generally accepted accounting principles. 
What principles Arthur Andersen was following lord only knows. But the firm that blessed not only Enron's books but also Waste Management's and Sunbeam's has somewhere in its employ auditors who can tell right from wrong and quality from its opposite. If auditors have the right incentives they will do so. 
Mr. Pitt, who in private practice represented, among others, Arthur Andersen, and who, in general, never saw a government action he didn't find worthy of challenging, says now that he doesn't want to throw armies of lawyers and bucketfuls of taxpayer money at "every problem." Nor does he desire new legislation. All that is needed is an outside monitoring group and better disclosure. 
Indeed, the beauty of disclosure, which lies at the heart of our system of public markets, is that it does the work of cops better (usually) than legions of investigators. Just as a street thug is unlikely to commit a mugging in a well-lit park, a corporate criminal won't often steal if he knows his actions will soon be disclosed. 
The question is who shines the lamp on corporate activity and -- just as important -- who makes sure that the beacon does not resort to a lampshade at inconvenient moments? In Enron's case, managers had the audacity to report $425 million of net income in the first quarter of 2001 -- a period in which it also reported cash flow from operations of negative $464 million. 
This bald disparity between cash flow, which is virtually impossible to manipulate, and reported earnings was a clear red flag that something was amiss. Andersen, from its own memos at the time, knew it -- and let it go. 
Enron has been widely compared to Long Term Capital Management, the bond-trading hedge fund that imploded in 1998. But it is the contrast between the two that is illustrative. It demonstrates the difference between problems spawned by poor judgment and those involving conflicts of interest -- in Mr. Pitt's phrase, "auditor independence." 
At first blush, the two cases seem much alike. Both LTCM and Enron were big, complex and secretive. LTCM's traders cut their teeth in financial derivatives, when those markets were new, inefficient and ripe with opportunity. Enron, somewhat similarly, was a pioneer in energy derivatives. 
Over time, and largely thanks to LTCM's success, bond arbitrage became crowded and hedging opportunities narrowed, leading LTCM to branch into new arenas, including equities. Enron, similarly, forged into virgin markets, including fiber-optic bandwidth, data storage and snow protection for ski resorts -- the latter reminiscent of LTCM's monster trade in "equity volatility" (stock market insurance). Each firm was held in awe by investors and creditors and by legions of worshipful admirers until -- quite suddenly -- it collapsed. 
But these similarities shouldn't blind us to the fact that Enron and LTCM were wholly dissimilar in their degree of moral culpability. LTCM's results, when the firm was making money, were genuine, and its traders were the biggest losers in the firm's downfall. That they went down with the ship tells us they genuinely believed in the product. 
Enron's managers, on the other hand, unloaded bucketfuls of stock even while they were publicly touting it. That's why a criminal investigation is warranted, and why conflict of interest is at the heart of the Enron case. 
Enron's managers had to know -- indeed, were warned -- that their accounting was highly, highly dubious. Had they feared an accounting in the Biblical sense they never would have tried to report such "results" -- which, of course, have since been reversed. What made them so certain of Andersen's protection? 
For one, Andersen was co-opted by the $27 million it was paid by Enron for other, non-audit work and by the reasonable expectation that more such gravy would follow. There is an easy solution to this particular conflict: ban it. Enron should not be able to otherwise pay off the firm that is supposedly serving as the guardian of its integrity. 
Mr. Pitt belittles the problem, saying that auditors are conflicted anyhow, just by the fees they receive for audits. Who wants to anger the client by being a pain in the neck and lose the job for next year? 
But again, the chairman misses the point. Auditors don't work for managers; they work for the directors. Hiring and firing auditors is solely up to the audit committee of the board. But owing to the consulting-type payoffs Andersen received and, more seriously, long cultural tradition, auditors behave as though the client is management. 
This problem is deeply embedded in our corporate culture. It is why executives at top corporations from General Electric on down routinely try to "manage" their earnings and why their auditors routinely help them. If auditors understood that their true client is the board -- and through it, the investing public -- they would see that their interest is in disclosing a true picture, not a prettified one. 
But this sort of cultural change is never easy -- in this case only a total overhaul can get the job done. We need an independent watchdog with legislative teeth, not the administrative wand-waving proposed by Mr. Pitt. In short, Congress should create a body that could set standards in public auditing and would also have real disciplinary and enforcement powers to monitor public auditors. 
Mr. Pitt can still undo the harm from his comment that "there is nothing rotten with the accounting profession." None less than his boss, George W. Bush, found a new sense of purpose -- an enlarged appreciation for his job and for the meaning of leadership -- when events interrupted what had seemed to be a placid era. 
Harvey Pitt, this is your Afghanistan.

Accounting for Enron: Resources, Power Of State Authorities Tested by Andersen
By Russell Gold
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

01/23/2002
The Wall Street Journal
A4
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Tiny state boards of accountancy are the latest players to step into the widening investigation of Arthur Andersen LLP following the collapse of Enron Corp. 
Theoretically, they have formidable strength -- subpoena power and statutory authority to take away Andersen's permit to practice accounting in a state. But that would be a huge leap for thinly staffed agencies that usually spend their time administering Certified Public Accountant exams and disciplining local accountants who have been convicted of crimes. The agencies have no ability to pursue criminal charges, but can pursue civil penalties through an administrative-law procedure.
In Texas, where Andersen fired its lead auditor for Enron last week for overseeing document destruction, the State Board of Public Accountancy has opened an inquiry to determine whether "possible misdeeds, omissions or malfeasance" took place. State Rep. Steven Wolens, who requested the investigation, said if the board recommends the revoking of Andersen's permit, that would have "a domino effect. All the eyes would be on New York and California to act next." 
Already other states, including Connecticut and Illinois, have begun their own investigations. Other states also may be taking action, but state professional regulation laws generally prohibit disclosure of pending matters. David Costello, president of the National Association of State Boards of Accountancy, has said state boards "throughout the U.S. are vigilantly tracking" reports about Enron and Andersen. Governors typically appoint board directors who then hire permanent staff. 
Michael Kozik, an attorney with the Connecticut State Board of Accountancy, wouldn't say whether the states were working together. "We have opened a file and we are starting to explore the legal and accounting issues involved," he says. The matter was initiated at the request of state Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, who said in a letter to the board that the state and its citizens already have suffered "serious and possibly irretrievable financial losses." A state pension fund and agency lost a combined $235 million. 
Meanwhile, attorneys general from Georgia, Washington, Ohio and Alabama have asked the U.S. District Court in Houston to name them lead plaintiffs in a nationwide class-action lawsuit against Enron and Andersen. The four states' retirement pension boards lost a combined $331 million because of the collapsed value of Enron's stock and bonds. Other states could join as members of the class. 
Amid this case and myriad other investigations, can the Texas accountancy board -- an agency with five lawyers (the state attorney general can help out in major cases) and a $550,000 investigation budget intended to resolve complaints "emphasizing voluntary compliance and education" -- realistically be expected to build its own case? 
"I think they will be absolutely overwhelmed," says Wayne Shaw, an accounting professor at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. "Almost always what you see is them going after an individual already convicted of something, or investigating a one- or two-person firm. They have never had to deal with anything like this. I don't think they have the structure or expertise to deal with this." 
While Mr. Wolens's letter directs the board to investigate the Big Five accounting firm, Mr. Shaw says it is more likely the board will focus on a handful of Andersen auditors. Andersen lawyers so far have taken steps to separate the Chicago firm from the activities of its Houston office, which handled the Enron account. 
William Treacy, executive director of the state board, declines to comment on the Andersen matter, but says "we have the necessary resources to investigate and prosecute cases of a major nature."

Accounting Industry Review Board Votes to End Its Existence in Protest
By Scot J. Paltrow and Jonathan Weil
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

01/23/2002
The Wall Street Journal
A2
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

The accounting industry's Public Oversight Board, which oversees auditors' "peer review" method of self-regulation, unexpectedly voted itself out of existence, a move that at least temporarily would leave no mechanism in place for policing audits of public companies. 
The board's chairman, Charles A. Bowsher, said the abrupt move was meant as a protest to plans announced last week by SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt to devise a new body that eventually would replace the oversight board in monitoring the industry.
The announcement, which caught the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Big Five accounting firms by surprise, comes as the accounting industry, in the wake of Enron Corp.'s collapse, faces unprecedented criticism for failing to supervise itself effectively amid repeated failure by auditors to detect major accounting irregularities. 
"We thought that in the public interest we just had to speak up" by voting to shut down, said Mr. Bowsher, adding that "it just isn't true" that Mr. Pitt's proposal would increase independent oversight of auditors. 
The oversight board, founded in 1977, reviews and must approve the peer reviews accounting firms do of one another. Its staff also investigates "failed audits" in which auditors failed to ferret out companies' violations of accounting rules. The system has been heavily criticized because no large accounting firm has ever been given an unfavorable review. Mr. Bowsher had argued that the board could have been a much more effective regulator if the industry had allowed it to have real powers to demand records and impose disciplinary measures on firms. 
The five-member board voted unanimously to "terminate its existence" no later than March 31. The decision was made in a telephone meeting of the board on Sunday, but was announced yesterday. Although Mr. Pitt has announced broad outlines of his plan for a new body with stronger powers to discipline the industry, no formal proposal has been drawn up. If the oversight board shuts down as planned, that threatens to leave the industry without an overseer of audits at least for several months. 
Mr. Bowsher said the board felt that Mr. Pitt's plan, rather than increasing independent oversight of the profession, actually would tighten accounting firms' control. For example, he noted, the proposal is for a new board that would have a large minority of its members from the accounting industry. The five members of the current oversight board are prominent people from the business world who have no direct ties to the big accounting firms. In a letter to Mr. Pitt notifying him of the board's decision, Mr. Bowsher also faulted Mr. Pitt for holding a series of private meetings in recent weeks with officials of the Big Five accounting firms and the industry's trade association, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, before he announced his plan on Jan. 17. 
The AICPA and Big Five firms were Mr. Pitt's clients while he was in private legal practice before he became SEC chairman. 
Mr. Bowsher said the SEC and AICPA have contacted him asking whether the board would reconsider its decision. He said the board will listen to their proposals but "I would be surprised if we reversed our decision." 
In a letter to Mr. Bowsher today, Mr. Pitt said the new regime he envisions would have a role for the oversight board and said, "The issues, I think, are too important for the POB simply to walk away." 
KPMG LLP said, "We believe it's irresponsible for the Public Oversight Board simply to resign." 
A spokesman for PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP confirmed that chief executives of the Big Five firms, including Pricewaterhouse, had held a series of private meetings with Mr. Pitt in Washington between Dec. 4 and Jan. 17. He said the gatherings took place at Mr. Pitt's invitation. He said the firms reported on progress they had made in response to Mr. Pitt's call in early December for them to come up with a better plan for policing the industry. 
The SEC plan calls for a new board with stronger powers to oversee audits, but it wouldn't be a formal self-regulatory organization like the New York Stock Exchange or National Association of Securities Dealers, which derive their disciplinary authority from laws passed by Congress, and which themselves are formally subject to SEC oversight. 
SEC spokeswoman Christi Harlan said Mr. Pitt's private meetings with the Big Five officials, which included Andersen representatives, didn't violate conflict-of-interest rules because he "just got the process rolling" and wasn't taking official action. 
John Coffee, a Columbia Law School professor who has written about regulation of the accounting industry, faulted Mr. Pitt for holding the private gatherings. "It's not the high watermark of public accountability when the industry to be regulated designs its own regulatory structure in negotiations with its former lawyer." 
Lynn Turner, who was the SEC's chief accountant under former SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt, yesterday also faulted Mr. Pitt's proposal and the private negotiations. The Public Oversight Board's decision to disband "shows you that what the SEC has proposed is what the accounting profession wants, and has nothing to do with the public," says Mr. Turner, now an accounting professor at Colorado State University. "What the POB is saying here is that the SEC's proposal was a deal cut with the accounting profession and not with the investing public." 
Ms. Harlan, the SEC spokeswoman, stressed that Mr. Pitt plans to get input from interests besides the accounting industry before the SEC issues a formal proposal.

Bidders Circle Over Enron's Indian Unit, Raising Prospect That It May Be Split Up
A Wall Street Journal News Roundup

01/23/2002
The Wall Street Journal

(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW DELHI -- The bidding process for the troubled Indian unit of energy trader Enron Corp., which has filed for bankruptcy, could begin early next month, according to a representative of one of the potential buyers. 
Some prospective bidders appear most interested in the unit's liquefied-natural-gas facilities. While creditors have said they want to sell the Indian power plant and LNG business together, this raises the prospect that the Indian unit could be split after it is sold.
Jean-Claude Breton, chief representative in India for European oil company TotalFina Elf, said that the bidders and Dabhol Power Co., Enron's Indian arm, might begin due diligence in early February. He said TotalFina was studying whether to bid. "We need some more time to convince ourselves whether or not this project can be made commercially viable," he said. 
At $2.9 billion, Dabhol is India's largest foreign investment. But it has been plagued by controversy. Last May, the local electricity board -- the plant's sole customer -- stopped paying Dabhol for power in a dispute largely about pricing. 
Royal Dutch/Shell last month also expressed an interest in the Dabhol project -- primarily its LNG pier and storage depot. A Shell spokesman in London said he couldn't immediately comment on whether Shell would bid for Dabhol. 
French state-owned Gaz de France has a 10% stake in Petronet LNG, which is planning to bring liquefied gas from the Middle East to India. A spokeswoman said the company is examining other opportunities in India, although she couldn't immediately comment on whether Gaz de France might bid for Dabhol. Indian power utilities BSES Ltd. and Tata Power Co. have also expressed interest in bidding. Enron owns 65% of Dabhol, General Electric Co. and Bechtel Corp. each own 10%, and the Maharashtra State Electricity Board owns 15%.

Spinoff pays bill for sins of its parent
Enron partner bound by promises not kept 
By NELSON ANTOSH 
Copyright 2002 Houston Chronicle 
Jan. 22, 2002, 11:25PM
EOTT Energy Partners was battered on the New York Stock Exchange Tuesday, mainly because of problems related to its former parent, Enron Corp. 
The publicly traded units of one of the nation's largest independent gatherers and marketers of crude oil closed at $10.19, off by $4.86. Early in the day they fell as low as $8.40. 
Although EOTT itself isn't part of the Enron bankruptcy, Enron's inability to pay on past promises will hurt EOTT in several ways. 
One of the Enron subsidiaries in Chapter 11, Enron Gas Liquids, has a long-term contract to sell products for EOTT that can't be honored, which increases its exposure to price swings. 
Additionally, Enron can't make up a 22.5-cents-per-unit shortfall on EOTT's cash distribution for the fourth quarter, which leaves holders considerably short of the 47.5 cents they were promised. The period that ended Dec. 31 was the last quarter for this arrangement. 
EOTT announced Tuesday that the cash distribution for the quarter will be 25 cents. It will make a claim for Enron's 22.5 cents in bankruptcy court. 
This further weakens earnings at a time when slumping crude oil prices are shrinking the profit margins on the approximately 350,000 barrels per day the company handles. 
EOTT officials warned that earnings for 2001 will be below the earlier estimates of 90 cents to 94 cents per unit, while declining to elaborate or to provide estimates for 2002. 
On Tuesday, Moody's placed EOTT's credit ratings under review for a possible downgrade. 
"The first weak quarter in two years for our marketing and transportation business comes at the worst possible time," said President and Chief Executive Officer Dana Gibbs. 
"Although our uncommitted credit lines continue to meet our immediate working capital and supplier credit needs, cash requirements over the next several months are at a historic high, and Enron's bankruptcy has significantly impacted the partnership's financing alternatives," he said in a written statement. 
The company won't disclose more until its fourth-quarter results are released in the latter half of February, Gibbs told analysts in a conference call. 
Enron is "a large part of its problems" said analyst David LaBonte of Salomon Smith Barney. 
The publicly traded partnership is independent, but Enron is still the general partner. LaBonte of Salomon Smith Barney said in an earlier analysis that he expects the general partnership interest to be put up for sale. 
Included are the $117 million purchase last year from Enron of an MTBE plant plus liquefied natural gas pipeline and storage facilities. 
Part of the deal was a 10-year "tolling agreement" with Enron. With this type of arrangement EOTT receives a fixed fee, with Enron serving as a middleman who doesn't use the MTBE or handle natural gas liquids. MTBE is a key chemical used in gasoline formulas in areas with pollution problems, like Houston. 
The bankrupt Enron Gas Liquids dropped out of the agreement, so EOTT began marketing the MTBE itself Nov. 29. This exposes the company to swings in the marketplace, said Gibbs. 
On the storage side there are problems as well. Enron Gas Liquids has the sole right to lease the facilities and until this is resolved EOTT can't negotiate with third parties, he added. 
EOTT plans to take a $30 million noncash charge to write down the value of these tolling and storage agreements. 
Enron was also supposed to foot the bill to convert the MTBE plant to one that makes a different additive if the Environmental Protection Agency decides to phase out MTBE, said an analyst who asked not to be identified. 
There was also speculation that EOTT may have overpaid for these facilities, which will be written down on the next financial report. 
Finally, suppliers who are concerned about Enron's bankruptcy have been requiring more letters of credit from EOTT. A very limited amount of business has been lost to people who decided to buy their crude elsewhere, said Gibbs. 
EOTT was formed in 1994 when Enron combined Enron Oil Trading & Transportation, renamed EOTT Energy, with Enron Products Marketing Co., according to Hoover's Inc.

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: REGULATIONS
Exemption Won In '97 Set Stage For Enron Woes
By STEPHEN LABATON

c. 2002 New York Times Company

WASHINGTON, Jan. 22 -- As it expanded aggressively overseas in the 1990's, the Enron Corporation won an exemption from a Depression-era law that would have prevented its foreign operations from shifting debt off their books and that barred executives from investing in partnerships affiliated with the company. 
The exemption enabled Enron's foreign operations to engage in the kind of financial engineering that experts now say was reminiscent of some of the corporate excesses of the 1920's that led to the 1940 law and that were an important element of the company's meteoric rise and startling collapse.
Had Enron not been granted the exemption, some of its operations in South America and in Europe would not have been able to structure financial operations to both conceal them from investors and shift debt off their books. 
Enron's initial efforts in 1996 to persuade Congress to change the law were thwarted by opposition from a powerful trade group and some federal regulators. The company responded by hiring the former boss of a leading staff official at the Securities and Exchange Commission to represent it in negotiations with the agency. In an unheralded five-paragraph order in March 1997, the S.E.C. official, Barry P. Barbash, gave Enron's foreign operations a broad exemption from the law -- the Investment Company Act of 1940. 
How Enron came to get its exemption from the severe restrictions of the law clearly illustrates the ways the company lobbied Washington and the response by the regulatory system. That system was devised during the Depression to protect investors and customers of utilities from a wide range of corporate abuses that investigators think ultimately took place at Enron. 
Both Congress and the S.E.C. are reviewing the exemption to the Investment Company Act and earlier exemptions that were given to the company by the agency, including a 1993 exemption from the tough restrictions imposed by the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. 
Experts say that the S.E.C. rulings unshackled the company from significant accounting restraints and business dealings between the Enron companies and their executives. The 1997 exemption, in particular, cleared the path for the company to both expand overseas and make greater use of the special partnerships that have caused the company so much turmoil. 
''From a regulatory standpoint, this raises a flag,'' said Joseph V. Del Raso, a former official at the S.E.C. in the 1980's and an expert on the Investment Company Act. ''It gave them carte blanche to go all over the world and set up subsidiaries and affiliated entities that would have been prohibited under the act.'' 
Another expert on the act, Mark A. Sargent, the dean of the Villanova law school, agreed. 
''The Enron structure was not a single company with stockholders engaged in operations like an ordinary corporation,'' he said. ''It was similar to an investment company with investments in a bunch of different companies. The decision to exempt those from the kind of protections to investors is now coming home to roost.'' 
Arthur Levitt, who was the chairman of the S.E.C. when the 1997 exemption was granted, said today that he had no recollection of it. But he said it could be a potentially significant part of the agency's role in failing to oversee Enron. 
''It may be one of those cases of the nail in the shoe of the horse,'' he said. ''It may be one of those things that seemed insignificant at the time but can wind up being determinative.'' 
Mr. Barbash, the lawyer at the S.E.C. who approved the exemption, said in an interview this week that he viewed the exemption as narrow because it applied only to the foreign operations of Enron and some of its subsidiaries. He said that it was successful in that it managed to head off Enron's efforts to have a broadly worded exemption written into the law ''that companies could have then driven trucks through.'' 
''Enron knew the regulatory boxes, and they tried to fashion their businesses to fall outside of those boxes,'' Mr. Barbash said. ''Much of what's been written so far about the company is that it turned itself inside out like a pretzel to fall outside of restrictions -- accounting restrictions, taxpayer restrictions and regulatory restrictions.'' 
Another former S.E.C. official who is an authority on the Investment Company Act, was more critical. 
''This was a case of giving Enron an inch and they took miles,'' said the former official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ''They were given a significant new opportunity, and they took it and flew it smasho into the ground.'' 
Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman, did not return a call seeking comment. 
Mr. Barbash, who at the time was director of the investment management division at the S.E.C., said that Enron's lawyers came to him in 1996 after the company had failed to persuade Congress to grant the company broad exemption to the 1940 law. 
Enron and several of its subsidiaries said they needed the exemption because their foreign operations were quickly taking on the characteristics of investment companies. The act, which regulates mutual funds and other kinds of investment companies, generally applies to companies that hold at least 40 percent of their assets in securities that are passive investments and not controlling interests. 
A lawyer who represented Enron said that although the company and its foreign subsidiaries had actually controlled many of their overseas ventures, like power plants, they were unable to have a 51 percent stake in them because of local rules and political constraints. 
In 1996, Congress rewrote parts of the act but refused to grant an exemption to Enron because of significant opposition from both the S.E.C. and the Investment Company Institute, the main trade organization for the mutual fund industry and a strong supporter of the law. Mr. Barbash said that in 1996, Congressional aides advised Enron's lawyers to seek an exemption directly from the agency. 
The company decided to retain Joel H. Goldberg, a former director of the investment management division at the S.E.C., who said today that he did not know how the company came to hire him. 
An Enron official said the company had retained Mr. Goldberg knowing that he had previously been Mr. Barbash's boss and was his predecessor at the S.E.C. Mr. Goldberg had been Mr. Barbash's supervisor at the S.E.C. in the 1980's and the Labor Department in the 1970's. The two lawyers are now partners at the international law firm of Shearman & Sterling. 
Mr. Goldberg said he viewed the exemption as a narrowly tailored one intended to permit the company to continue its overseas projects. But he acknowledged that had the company not been granted the exemption, it would have been constrained from using any partnerships or shifting debt off the books in its foreign operations. 
''I guess on the one hand, if they had been subject to the Investment Company Act, they probably could not have done these transactions,'' he said. ''The subsidiaries would not have existed, and they would have had to make another plan.''

DEBATE
Enron: A simple question of right and wrong

01/22/2002
USA Today

A.12
(Copyright 2002)

"To my knowledge, there is nothing that we have found that was illegal." 
That was Joseph Berardino, CEO of Arthur Andersen, on Sunday's Meet the Press, trying to comfort viewers about the integrity of the audits his company performed on the once-mighty energy firm, Enron. Enron's collapse, Berardino said, was a result of a bad business plan. "It failed because the economics didn't work."
Both statements may very well be true. But they're hardly reassuring. Quite the opposite, in fact. The less illegality found in the Enron debacle, the more chilling the picture becomes for investors. 
Just look at what Enron, often with the blessing of Andersen, managed to accomplish, apparently within the comfortable confines of today's laws: 
* For nearly five years, Enron inflated earnings by a total of almost $600 million. This "legal" practice forced investors to make decisions about the value of Enron's stock using bogus profit figures. 
* Using off-the-books partnerships and maddeningly opaque accounting, with Andersen's approval, Enron shielded about $500 million in debt. That helped keep Enron's credit rating high, but at the expense of misleading anyone foolish enough to trust the numbers coming from the company and the private credit-ratings agencies. 
To be sure, at least one high-level Enron official tried to do the right thing, raising concerns with Enron's CEO Kenneth Lay about the company's accounting practices. And some Andersen officials expressed concern about Enron's now-famous "partnerships" and how Enron was crunching its numbers back in February 2001. Even some stock analysts openly puzzled over how Enron made its money. 
But since everything looked legal on paper, those asking pointed questions were ignored. On Sept. 26, Lay was urging employees to buy company shares, telling them it was an "incredible bargain" and emphasizing that Andersen had signed off on the off-the-books partnerships. Just 20 days later, Enron announced a substantial third- quarter loss and a $1.2-billion drop in shareholder equity. 
Andersen continued to OK Enron's books. And stock analysts were busy touting its stock right up to the bitter end. As late as Oct. 25, all but two of 17 analysts were giving Enron stock a thumbs-up. 
Even if the nation's laws weren't so permissive, Enron very well may have met the same end. In a free-market economy, no business is guaranteed a successful future. But Berardino's defense that he couldn't find any illegality among all of these acts provides little solace to the thousands of Enron employees and countless investors who banked on Enron and Andersen for honest numbers and lost billions. Had everyone involved used an ethical compass, rather than a strictly legal one, investors would have been armed with accurate information about Enron's business and the risks it entailed when deciding whether or not to buy its stock. 
If investors and workers are to be spared calamitous surprises in the future, merely passing a raft of new legislation won't solve the problem. A change of attitude about what is acceptable in executive suites and on accounting desks is at least as vital.

Business World: Enron For Beginners
By Holman W. Jenkins Jr.

01/23/2002
The Wall Street Journal
A23
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Let's help the congressfolks who begin their multiple hearings into the Enron bankruptcy tomorrow. 
The problem wasn't Enron's trading business, which many have associated with deregulation and therefore with Satanism. Enron's problem was bad assets of a conventional variety: a power plant in India, utility and pipeline investments in Brazil, a waterworks in Britain, unused and inoperable telecommunications assets in this country.
Traditional accounting would have required the company to mark down its current earnings to cover the declining value of these assets. Instead, Enron chose to avail itself of a dodge, creating outside partnerships to buy the assets at list price. Banks put up the money, but the loans were secured with promises of Enron stock, and if the stock price fell, with promises of cash. That is, shareholders were still on the hook for the bad assets but they didn't know it. 
The standard view, that Enron executives were simple crooks, tends to overlook that they were also the company's biggest individual shareholders. If these were crooks, they were dumb crooks. 
We might understand, though not approve, if Ken Lay were sitting on a beach in the Bahamas now, his purloined millions in an untraceable Cayman Island bank account. But when the normally dexterous and astute Mr. Lay is handed a loaded gun and manages to shoot off most of his toes before the gun is taken away from him, then the questions get really interesting. 
We've seen the same scenario with other companies that weren't nearly so famous for political connections. Cendant almost imploded after it was found to have falsely accounted for its customer acquisition costs. Sunbeam under Al Dunlap shipped unwanted barbecue grills to shopkeepers and called them sales. These cases (and many like them) had nothing to do with deregulation or campaign finance yet they are of a single species with the Enron disaster. 
One can readily imagine what went through executives' minds: The assets will bounce back. Our new trading ventures will grow so fast as to dwarf the losses when we eventually are obliged to recognize them. 
The company had big plans for brokering advertising time, Internet bandwidth and other imagined "new economy" commodities, none of which were working out as quickly as hoped. In accounting logic, though, a theory can trump a fact if you believe hard enough, and Enron was full of believers (as news this week of Mr. Lay's soured investments in other new economy wonders shows). 
Worse, margins were eroding in Enron's core energy trading business. As we noted last June, revenues had quadrupled in a year but profits were up only 31% -- a sign that the business was going backward and would be in bad shape if revenues didn't keep growing spectacularly. 
Unfortunately, even the quadrupling was largely a function of idiosyncratic conditions in California, which were soon reversed. The sad truth is that Enron's business was maturing. There would be no great profusion of new earnings to make up the losses. Enron's accounting gamble had come a cropper. The roof finally fell in when the stock plummeted, causing lenders to demand cash Enron didn't have. 
Why Enron did what it did may, in some sense, be unknowable, but two factors seem to explain why high-growth companies in particular find it hard to take cognizance of dimming prospects. 
The Wall Street factor: Enron ran into the dilemma that comes to companies whose share prices reflect extravagant hopes about the future that prove unfounded -- how do you let the air out of your own stock? Our legal system and the ethos of shareholder capitalism make it very hard for companies to do that, so some stretch accounting logic in an attempt to protect the share price. 
The psychological factor: Ken Lay's name may be mud among Enron employees now, but an earlier generation remembers him as a decent guy and irrepressible visionary. But as the Rebecca Mark episode seemed to demonstrate, he had a weakness for the meteoric personalities in his midst. Ms. Mark was the bombshell and livewire who led the company's investment in the Dabhol power plant in India, which turned into a political and financial disaster, and then its foray into the water business, which became another disaster. 
Everything we've learned about Jeffrey Skilling, Mr. Lay's protege and the wunderkind CEO who mysteriously resigned last August, suggests he was another personality that Mr. Lay fell in love with. He moved Enron into losing investments in fiber-optic bandwidth and other new markets, and oversaw the debt-hiding strategy. When Enron's share price began unraveling, he claimed outlandishly that investors should be willing to pay twice the share price for Enron's shrinking earnings. 
Notice that we don't mention a lack of regulation or the need for campaign finance laws. Harrumphing in Washington won't stop the occasional Enron from falling off the edge. 
Accountants are right when they say accounting conventions haven't kept up with the world. Most of a company's value these days resides in assets not measured on a balance sheet, such as management's alertness to opportunity (which many saw as Enron's chief virtue). Indeed, an irony that will surely escape Congressional sleuths is that Enron wouldn't have failed if investors had not rewarded it with an excessively optimistic stock price in the first place. 
The fact is, as trading becomes cheaper and as investors diversify their risks with mutual funds, the public's appetite for risk has been growing stronger. We push companies to live more dangerously now, to roll the dice on inspired innovation. That's why we dangle large stock rewards in front of managements: to overcome their bias in favor of caution and self-protectiveness. 
The Enron hearings can serve a useful purpose if they foster a realistic view of the new, quicksilver corporate order. For instance, high-risk, high-reward, eggs-in-one-basket stock incentives are an excellent tool of behavior of modification when aimed at top executives, who can affect a company's share price with every decision. They make no sense for the average employee, who can't. 
The typical worker is already exposed enough to his firm's fortunes through his job. His pension savings should be put safely out of harm's way. We'll be lucky, though, if the hullabaloo over Enron, which is turning sillier and shriller by the day, doesn't run right past this obvious lesson and result in something truly unwise.

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE INVESTORS
In 401(k) Plans, a New Rush to Diversify
By PETER T. KILBORN

01/23/2002
The New York Times
Page 6, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

BALTIMORE, Jan. 22 -- People were thinking about the safety of their 401(k) retirement funds long before the fall of Enron -- the drop in the stock market over the last two years had assured that. 
But the Enron collapse, in which many of the company's employees lost their retirement savings, has moved people, including those having lunch at Jimmy's Famous Seafood Restaurant here, to take action.
''I've got an appointment Wednesday to talk with the representative at Metropolitan Life,'' said Pam, a Baltimore school system employee, who declined to give her full name. Sitting at another table was Roxanne, a state port employee, who also refused to give her last name. ''I've got plans to meet with my financial adviser to talk about diversity,'' she said. 
Across the country, from the docks of this industrial city, to Detroit, Chicago, Denver and Silicon Alley, people who once boasted of 20 percent year-by-year increases in their 401(k) retirement plans are on the move. They are making appointments with brokers and their human resources offices, reworking their portfolios and shifting money from the market's fallen stars. They are allocating more of their money to safer fixed-income securities and blue chip stocks -- companies that retain some of their trust. 
Donald Clarke, 56, a senior electrical engineer at Bethlehem Steel, was having Jimmy's sour beef and dumplings plate. The Enron scandal, he said, should put all investors on alert. ''All companies try to put a rosy picture on themselves for the stockholders,'' Mr. Clarke said. ''But they're still supposed to be truthful. Enron wasn't.'' 
Reports of the collapse of Enron employees' 401(k) accounts are stirring particular scrutiny of employers that require investment in their own stock. ''That's something that I'm really going to look into when I find my next job,'' said Sue Becker, 51, of Evanston, Ill., who recently left a job with a food processing company. ''That would definitely be a question I would ask in the interview.'' 
Michael Sachs, 28, a lawyer at Sonnenschein, Nath & Rosenthal in Chicago who has $12,000 to 15,000 in a 401(k) account, agreed. ''I'd be asking that question,'' he said.'' 
Paul Colwell, a history teacher at Lincoln Park High School outside Detroit, said Enron ''makes me wonder about some of the companies I'm invested in.'' 
Mr. Colwell added: ''What have they been doing? Are they as solid as I thought they were?'' 
Linda Schultz, 46, of Rosemont, Ill., works for Sears, Roebuck & Company in Chicago. Like Enron employees, she is required to hold stock in her company and has 30 percent of her 401(k) in Sears stock. Unlike Enron employees, her stock is worth something: at about $54 a share, it is far above the $15 Ms. Schultz paid when she began working at Sears 24 years ago. 
But in this climate she said she would get rid of the stock if her retirement plan permitted her to. Arthur Andersen, Enron's accounting firm, has done work for Sears in the past, Ms. Schultz said. ''People started wondering about what was going on with us, and they started getting nervous. You just don't know what's going to happen with the company.'' 
Some investors have thicker skins. Rory MacDonald, 53, who said he works for a ''worldwide big deal oil and gas company'' he wouldn't name, was taking a cigarette break in Denver's 16 Street Mall. He said his 401(k) account plunged $100,000 last year. 
Mr. MacDonald, who plans to retire at 63, said he considered directing the account into less volatile securities but did not change anything. ''I expect before my 10 years are up and I retire, the stock market will go back up and I will recoup that loss,'' he said. 
At Jimmy's, Mr. Clarke was having lunch with Terry Moore, 58, an engineer who retired from Bethlehem in 1994 after 30 years with the company. 
Except for the apparent corruption, they said, Enron has nothing on Bethlehem, which has also filed for bankruptcy protection. 
''Bethlehem was 48 cents today,'' Mr. Clarke said. ''When I started buying it, it was about $35 a share.'' The decline has meant a $70,000 loss in his retirement account. 
Before dumping it all, Mr. Moore made money with his Bethlehem stock. ''I bought and sold, bought and sold,'' he said, and managed to get his timing right. 
Unlike the many workers whose only retirement fund is a 401(k) account, Mr. Clarke and Mr. Moore also have fixed-benefit pensions, financed entirely by the company, that ensures them a monthly check of a fixed amount throughout their retirements. Mr. Moore collects about $2,000 a month, about $600 less than he would have received had he not retired early. 
But those plans, are not as safe as they seem. ''They can change it in a heartbeat,'' Mr. Moore said. If Bethlehem was shut down, the government would pick up the pension plan but reduce the benefit. 
For Barbara Friedman, who was having lunch at Jimmy's, Enron signifies the end of an era. ''Two years ago the market was fun,'' said Ms. Friedman, 59, whose two grown children are invested in sunken 401(k) plans. ''Win or lose, it was fun. Now it's not fun.'' 
As she paid her check, she continued. ''It isn't just Enron,'' she said. ''You had all these high-flying stocks. The worst thing was how attuned we became to those investment managers and television pundits, hanging on their every word. That trust has gone.''

New Order: Amid Enron's Fallout, And a Sinking Stock, Tyco Plans a Breakup --- Giant's Surprise Move Comes As More Companies Face Push for Clearer Numbers --- Suffering for Another's `Sins'
By Wall Street Journal staff reporters Mark Maremont, John Hechinger and Karen Damato

As the collapse of Enron Corp. triggers widespread investor anxiety about companies with inscrutable finances, giant Tyco International Ltd. -- its stock price depressed amid persistent questions about its books -- announced a surprise plan to split into four separate companies. 
The breakup represents a sharp departure from nearly a decade of acquisition-fueled growth that transformed Tyco from an obscure maker of fire-protection devices into one of the world's biggest conglomerates, with $38 billion in annual revenue and a stock-market value of about $95 billion.
The move is an about-face for L. Dennis Kozlowski, Tyco's ambitious chairman and chief executive, who last year said he was aiming for $100 billion in revenues by 2006. Now, Tyco is worth at least 50% more broken up than as a whole, he said. While saying that Tyco's accounting practices are spotless, Mr. Kozlowski told investors that separating the company into smaller, independent entities will offer investors "greatly increased simplicity, clarity and transparency." 
Mr. Kozlowski declared: "A lot of companies are going to suffer for Enron's sins." But he said his spinoff wasn't planned in reaction to the recent drop in Tyco's stock price. Rather, he said, for the past 18 months or so, Tyco executives have been frustrated by the low ratio of the company's stock price to its earnings, even as the company has continued to deliver strong earnings growth. 
Transparency was exactly what some investors believed was lacking at Tyco, whose chief businesses include security gear, medical products, and financial services. The company's acquisitions, while generally regarded as well executed, made its financial statements increasingly difficult to analyze. Acquired companies disappeared into much bigger Tyco units, making their subsequent performance impossible to track. Some smaller acquisitions were never even announced. 
Tyco's breakup marks the latest sign that investors and regulators are demanding more clarity from companies' disclosures to the public. In the wake of the Enron debacle, jittery investors have been fleeing any stock with even a whiff of accounting controversy. When a wave of fresh accounting rumors about Tyco started soon after Jan. 1, the company's shares tumbled nearly 25% in less than three weeks, wiping almost $30 billion from its market value. That created profits for short sellers, whose trading strategy bets on a stock's decline. 
"Enron and others have really shaken things up, and it's provided fuel for shorts who have been all over [Tyco] for years," said Bruce Bartlett, director of growth investing at Oppenheimer Funds, which owns about 5.5 million shares of Tyco in eight different mutual funds. Mr. Bartlett said he doesn't believe any of the buzz about possible accounting problems at Tyco. But investors, he said, "hate stories that don't have accounting transparency." 
The Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday reminded public companies of the need to clearly disclose financial transactions, including off-balance-sheet financings, in their forthcoming annual reports. Enron used such arrangements to keep large amounts of debt off of its books. There is no suggestion, even from Tyco's critics, that it has employed off-balance-sheet financing or secret partnerships. 
Moody's Investors Service, the big credit-rating agency, has made an unusual demand of more than 4,000 bond issuers: to provide new information on any off-balance-sheet arrangements that could pose financial risks. 
"We need better disclosure about these matters in this reporting season," SEC Chief Accountant Robert K. Herdman said in the commission's statement. He urged companies to exceed minimum legal disclosure requirements and also said the SEC is continuing to study how it can improve disclosure of esoteric financial arrangements. 
Auditing firms also are clearly feeling pressure from the very public pillorying of Enron auditor Arthur Andersen LLP. That harsh spotlight is "stiffening the spines of auditors in other companies," said James Gipson, lead manager of Clipper Fund, a mutual fund with about $2.5 billion in assets. "Audits taking place right now are likely to be very diligent, much more so than they were a year or two ago," he said. "In the long run, investors will be well served by that." 
Professional investors say they are stepping up their own vigilance because of the Enron meltdown. "We are paying more attention to" companies' more complex financial engineering, said Steve Fossel, a portfolio manager and vice president with Berger LLC, a unit of Stilwell Financial Inc. While Berger has always made an effort to analyze such arrangements, recent events have moved that "more toward the front of your mind," he said. 
Tyco's announcement last week of results for its fiscal first quarter, which ended Dec. 31, provided a prime example of what some investors have called the company's preference for baffling disclosures. The results featured three separate changes in accounting practices and a "pro forma" section on hypothetical year-earlier earnings. There were also numerous charges and credits Tyco treated as extraordinary, even though some are considered part of operating results under generally accepted accounting principles. 
Although the accounting-practice changes were adopted to conform with recent changes in general standards, even some accounting professors were left shaking their heads at the complexity of the results. 
Meanwhile, the Bermuda-registered Tyco has also been lowering its taxes and interest costs through a complex international structure that, in part, involves issuing debt through a Luxembourg subsidiary. Befuddled investors have found themselves wading through numerous lengthy footnotes in an attempt to decipher all of this. Some wonder how Tyco has been able to report 40% average annual growth in per-share earnings over the last five years with a grab-bag collection of businesses, ranging from disposable diapers to home-alarm systems. 
Tyco's response has been that it chooses the right businesses to acquire, cuts costs to maximize efficiency and provides generous incentives to keep its managers at the top of their game. It has also said that its free cash flow -- which it put at $4.8 billion last year -- demonstrates the integrity and authenticity of its earning power. 
Until the Enron scandal, questions about Tyco's accounting seemed to have subsided. An SEC investigation of its merger-related accounting ended in 2000, when the SEC essentially cleared the company, and the stock had recovered. 
Mr. Kozlowski said Tyco executives began seriously considering a breakup more than a year ago but didn't move forward with it until he began informally approaching some directors last month. The company then engaged Goldman Sachs & Co. to analyze a potential breakup. The final decision took place at a two-day board meeting in Bermuda that ended Monday. "We didn't just wake up a week ago and say, `Hey, the stock is going down. Let's break up the company," the Tyco chief said. 
Under the plan to separate the company into four parts, the security and electronics units, with $17.6 billion in 2001 revenue, will form the core of a slimmed-down Tyco run by Mr. Kozlowski. Three other units -- a finance subsidiary, a health-care business, and a unit making fire-protection devices and "flow-control" equipment, such as valves and pipes -- will each be split off into a new company. As much as 20% of each new company will be sold in initial public offerings. 
After the IPOs, Mr. Kozlowski said Tyco plans to spin the remainder of the three companies out to shareholders by the end of 2002. In addition, Tyco plans to sell its plastics unit, which Mr. Kozlowski predicted could bring $3 billion to $4 billion. If all goes as planned, Tyco plans to eliminate $11 billion of its $23 billion in debt, excluding obligations of its finance arm. 
Investors reacted cautiously to the breakup plan, pushing Tyco shares up just $1.10, to $47.55, in 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading. That's still far below the nearly $59 level at which Tyco started 2002, and well short of Mr. Kozlowski's prediction that the breakup plan would add 50% in value for investors. 
Don MacDougall, an analyst with J.P. Morgan, praised Tyco's plan, estimating the breakup value of the company at $90 a share. Mr. MacDougall said investors will be eager to snap up shares in the IPOs, especially of the company's health-care business, a Wall Street favorite these days. That business makes medical products such as sutures, syringes, and diagnostic-imaging supplies. 
Mr. MacDougall said dividing the company into smaller pieces should allay investor suspicion about Tyco's complexity, because each segment will disclose far more detailed information. "Acquisitions at Tyco created financial statements that are far more complex than the average company's," he said. That depressed Tyco's share price, he added. "We've long felt that discount is inappropriate." 
But some investors reacted more skeptically. Kevin McCloskey, a portfolio manager at Federated Investors Inc. in Pittsburgh, which owns 4.3 million Tyco shares, said the plan could deliver higher share prices, but he added, "I have to question whether this is the time to give up on their [prior] strategy." He said he suspects that Tyco executives were afraid they wouldn't be able to meet their own earnings projections, and with the stock price so low, couldn't make new acquisitions. "So they come up with Plan C, which is split up the company," he said. 
Piloting the audacious breakup plan through his board in just a month is characteristic behavior for Mr. Kozlowski, the son of a Newark, N.J., detective who joined Tyco as assistant controller in 1976. After running three divisions, he took the reins as chief executive in 1992. The company then had $3 billion in annual revenue from such operations as valves, pipes and fire-sprinkler systems. By last year, he had expanded revenue 12-fold, gobbling up scores of companies along the way, including ADT alarm systems, AMP electrical connectors and U.S. Surgical. 
In making deals, Mr. Kozlowski insists on a simple formula: Tyco doesn't do hostile deals, and every acquisition has to add to earnings immediately. Once Tyco acquires a firm, it cuts costs, sometimes ruthlessly. On the same day in 1999 it bought Batts Inc., a family-run maker of plastic hangers, Tyco executives stunned the company's employees by announcing the closure of all three factories in its Michigan hometown. Tyco executives said the closures helped integrate Batts into its other hanger operations. 
Tyco is highly decentralized, run from a simple, two-story wooden building in Exeter, N.H., staffed with top executives and a few dozen accountants, lawyers and acquisition specialists. Unit managers are given considerable leeway -- and paid handsomely for delivering results. During much of the 1990s, the formula was a spectacular success, with the stock rising more than 12-fold between the day Mr. Kozlowski took the helm and early October 1999. 
That was about the time the first serious questions about Tyco's accounting arose. The concerns were aired in a newsletter, published by Dallas money manager David Tice. Mr. Tice claimed that Tyco had a history of taking huge acquisition-related charges that could be used to pump up profits later. He also warned that investors weren't paying enough attention to the charges, which he said were obscuring the company's actual results. 
Tyco executives hotly disputed the allegations, but its stock took a steep fall after the SEC began an informal inquiry into the company's accounting practices. In mid-2000, after Tyco made some minor adjustments in restating its books, the SEC ended its inquiry without taking any action. Bullish investors saw that as vindication of Tyco's bookkeeping. 
After the SEC inquiry ended, Tyco kept chugging along, delivering a 42% increase in per-share earnings in fiscal 2000, before what Tyco called restructuring and other "non-recurring" items, and another 29% increase on a similar basis last year. But the stock didn't take off as Tyco executives hoped. Instead, it bounced up and down with the market. It closed yesterday below its October 1999 level, prior to Mr. Tice's report. 
Tyco executives believe they have been victimized, in part, by short sellers, who try to profit from a stock's decline by selling borrowed shares in hopes of replacing them with shares bought later at a lower price. The company has been a favorite of the shorts, who have contended that Tyco's numbers are simply too good to be believed. 
For starters, Tyco critics have said the company has been improving its performance by having acquired companies take inflated writeoffs and otherwise manipulate their books in their last few months of independence before being gobbled up by Tyco. This period typically isn't subject to any scrutiny by outsiders because the acquired company usually doesn't file financial statements for the period. 
For example, some cite a series of charges by finance company CIT Group Inc. last year in the two months before it was acquired by Tyco. CIT posted a net loss of $78.8 million in its final two months of independence, when investors didn't much care. Then, after being absorbed by Tyco, it posted net income of $71.2 million in the remaining month of its June quarter. Tyco executives have said the accounting was proper, and that they told investors that CIT's one-month results were artificially high owing in part to large quarter-end revenue. 
Others have noted Tyco's seemingly uncanny ability to keep lowering its tax rate, especially in quarters in which it needs extra income. In last year's fourth quarter, the company reported a tax rate of just 19.2%, down from 24.7% for the first nine months, and 24.2% in the year-earlier period. Tyco has said it had overestimated its tax rate earlier in the year and had to adjust it in the fourth quarter. The lower rate added about five cents per share to earnings in a quarter in which it beat analysts' expectations by two cents. 
Even many veteran money managers have said Tyco's financial statements have been so complex that they didn't understand them fully. Alfred Harrison, a manager of Alliance Premier Growth Fund in New York, which has $12 billion in assets, including Tyco shares, said recently that "nobody knows how they put it together, but they do." Mr. Harrison likened Tyco's complexity in some senses to Enron, saying "to some degree, they become faith stocks." 
When that faith started to diminish in recent weeks, Mr. Kozlowski vowed that he would no longer use Tyco stock to make acquisitions. With the company shouldering $23 billion in debt -- mostly from prior deals -- many wondered how Tyco would be able to keep gobbling up companies. The fear was that without dealmaking, the company's growth would begin to falter. 
Mr. Tice, the Dallas money manager, said yesterday's announcement suggested a repudiation of the company' strategy of growing through serial acquisitions, financed with a rising stock price and growing debt levels. "This is essentially Tyco's dream exploding," he said. "The company always wanted to get big -- to grow -- not break up." 
About a month and half ago, Mr. Tice also started shorting Tyco shares in his Prudent Bear mutual fund. He said he did so in part because he believed investors were starting to grow more skeptical of companies with obscure financial statements. "We just felt like earnings would slow down and that there would be more concern about accounting issues after Enron," he said. 
Mr. Kozlowski denied any "defensive" reason for the breakup plan, saying the company was on track to make its earnings targets for this year. He said Tyco would deliver $5.5 billion next year in free cash flow -- a measure tracked by many Tyco analysts and investors, who consider it a key indicator of earnings quality. Mr. Kozlowski also said Tyco had no reason to be concerned about its debt, which was low considering the size of its total balance sheet. 
But at some point, the Tyco chief said, investors were going to start clamoring for a breakup. Instead of waiting two or three years to prove to skeptical investors that its model works, he decided on the breakup plan. Sometimes, he added, "you just have to pull the trigger and do it."

Re ''Web of Safeguards Failed as Enron Fell'' (front page, Jan. 20): 
It is undoubtedly true that ''there is likely to be plenty of blame to go around'' for the failure of the Enron Corporation, but a general explanation is already apparent.
Enron's collapse was a product of the culture of greed, dishonesty, ethical blindness and wishful thinking that has characterized much of corporate America since the advent of the Reagan administration and that has been allowed to flourish essentially unchecked for the last 20 years (largely because politicians from both parties are dependent on campaign contributions from big business). 
The inevitable ''criminal, civil and Congressional investigations'' will merely be sorting out the details.

I do not believe that the American people will settle for less.
Oh, yes, we little people understand exactly what happened at Enron, and we are furious about it. If the administration and Congress are sincere in wanting to find the truth, then our course of action is crystal clear: appoint a special prosecutor who is acceptable to both parties.

Now that the Sept. 11 aftermath has subsided, and Enron is the top issue being debated nationally, shouldn't some of those good, healthy sentiments be revived for the sake of our country's future?

In all the duplicity involving Enron, I find it particularly troubling that Enron paid no corporate income taxes in four of the last five years (front page, Jan. 17). 
Here is a company that claimed to be a leading corporate citizen and that could not possibly have done more to pervert our democratic, free-market system.
My sincere hope is that the pernicious system of corporate influence in Washington and in the state capitols that permitted this debacle to occur will continue to be exposed so that it can be dismantled.

Enron Letter Writer Worked At Key Partnership Early On

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

(This article was originally published Thursday.)
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--The Enron Corp. (ENE) executive who warned Chief Executive Kenneth Lay in August that questionable accounting practices could bring about the company's downfall was initially hired by Enron to work on one of the partnerships now at the center of current federal investigations, the executive's lawyer and Enron said. 
Enron hired Sherron S. Watkins away from accounting firm Arthur Andersen in 1993 to oversee the accounting for Joint Energy Development Investment, an off-balance-sheet partnership Enron started with the California Public Employees Retirement System to make investments in energy projects, an Enron spokesperson and Watkins' lawyer Philip H. Hilder said. 
After four years in her post, Watkins expressed concerns about accounting practices used on the partnership and asked to be reassigned, Hilder said. Watkins did some "clean-up" work regarding JEDI in early 1997, and then was moved to a new job, he said. 
"She did raise some concerns at that time," Hilder said. Watkins told current Enron Chief Financial Officer Jeff McMahon, a long-time colleague, that she was uncomfortable with the accounting practices she was told to employ in her work for JEDI, Hilder said. 
McMahon declined to comment on the issue. 
Robert Bennett, an attorney representing Enron in federal investigations of the company, wouldn't comment on whether concerns were raised or how they were handled. 
Last November, Enron conceded it shouldn't have treated JEDI as a separate entity. Consolidating JEDI and a related partnership, Chewco Investments LP, into its financial reports reduced Enron's earnings by $400 million. 
Enron auditor Arthur Andersen has said consolidating those partnerships accounted for most of the restatement of Enron's financial reports, which all told reduced the company's earnings by about 20% over a four-year period beginning in 1997. 

Trouble With JEDI 

The trouble with JEDI came in 1997, when Enron wanted to establish a new partnership with Calpers called JEDI II. Calpers was willing to invest $500 million in the new partnership, but wanted to recover its $250 million investment in JEDI. 
According to published reports and congressional testimony by an Andersen official, Enron bought Calpers' interest in JEDI for $375 million, then sold it to Chewco, another Enron off-balance-sheet partnership. Chewco's investment allowed Enron to avoid booking JEDI-related debt to its own balance sheet. It emerged later that Enron had guaranteed part of Chewco's investment, invalidating its status as an outside party and forcing the consolidation. 
As reported, Andersen Chief Executive and Managing Partner Joseph Berardino told a House committee that the firm only learned of Enron's guarantee in November, at which time it alerted Enron to "possible illegal acts" within the company. Enron said at the time it has always been open with its auditor and notified Andersen as soon as it learned the information. 
Revelations about JEDI, Chewco and other Enron partnerships eventually ruined the one-time market leader's credibility on Wall Street and led to the biggest bankruptcy filing in U.S. history. The U.S. Justice Department, several Congressional committees, and the Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating the collapse. 
Watkins warned in her much-publicized August 2001 letter to Lay that Enron's handling of the partnerships could produce such an outcome. "I am incredibly nervous that we will implode in a wave of accounting scandals," she wrote. 
Watkins wrote her letter to Lay one day after then Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling abruptly resigned from the company on Aug. 14, attorney Hilder said. 

Work On Raptor, Condor 

At the time, Watkins had been working with Fastow for a month on a temporary basis on some of the partnerships. Watkins was able to go into detail in her letter about transactions with partnerships called Raptor and Condor because "she was reviewing the assets of Raptor and Condor for potential sale," he said. 
"She saw that there were some serious questions with the accounting operations and raised some questions and wanted the executives to be aware," Hilder said. 
The issues she raised - namely that the partnerships were thinly capitalized and insufficiently independent - were those that eventually forced Enron to consolidate some of the partnerships. 
Those close to Fastow now characterize Watkins as a disgruntled employee who hadn't quickly climbed the corporate ladder. 
Watkins' lawyer dismissed that conclusion. "It's completely the opposite of disgruntled," Hilder said. "She found great job satisfaction. She had an outstanding work history with Enron." 
Enron lawyer Bennett also distanced the company from those characterizations. "She certainly isn't a kook," Bennett said. 
As reported, Watkins met with Lay, who asked Enron's outside law firm to review her concerns. The firm, Vinson & Elkins, concluded in an Oct. 15 report that the accounting for the partnerships was sound, but that Enron could face public-relations problems if the details were revealed. Watkins initially hadn't signed the letter she sent to Lay, but was later convinced to reveal her identity by McMahon, at the time the chief executive of Enron Industrial Markets, Hilder said. 
Watkins brought her concerns about the partnerships to McMahon because she has a longstanding relationship with him dating back to the late 1980s, according to Hilder. Both worked at MG Natural Gas Corp. and Arthur Andersen. 
They also shared a concern about the partnerships. In early 2000, when he was Enron's treasurer, McMahon raised concerns about partnerships headed by Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow to Skilling, then Enron's president, according to The Wall Street Journal. Skilling wasn't concerned, and McMahon moved on to a new post. After Fastow was ousted in late October 2001, McMahon was named CFO.

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE AUDITOR
Enron's Chief Sold Shares After Receiving Warning Letter
By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. and JONATHAN D. GLATER

01/18/2002
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 2
c. 2002 New York Times Company

Documents disclosed yesterday indicate that Kenneth L. Lay, the chairman and chief executive of Enron, disposed of stock within days of receiving a letter warning of accounting problems at the company. 
That letter, from Sherron S. Watkins, a senior employee, ignited an investigation by Enron's outside law firm, which concluded that the accounting issues could be embarrassing. As part of that inquiry, Mr. Lay met with Ms. Watkins.
The documents released yesterday by Congressional investigators were internal memos from Arthur Andersen, Enron's auditor, which the company fired yesterday. The documents not only put Mr. Lay's stock transactions and the Watkins letter on a timeline, but also provide the best map to date of what Andersen officials considered doing about Enron's accounting. 
In Houston, investigators continued to interview Enron executives and to press for more information on Enron's collapse and Andersen's role, including the destruction of documents. 
One memo released by investigators revealed that as long ago as February, Andersen workers considered dropping Enron as a client because of concerns about the disclosure of off-balance-sheet debts. 
Enron's sudden collapse last fall and the resulting criminal and civil investigations revolve around Enron's transactions with partnerships formed by Andrew S. Fastow, Enron's former chief financial officer. Mr. Fastow was ousted in late October as investors grew concerned about the partnerships, among them LJM1 and LJM2. Enron subsequently disclosed that Mr. Fastow made more than $30 million off the deals. 
An e-mail message dated Feb. 6, 2001, released by investigators, showed that Andersen partners discussed whether to consolidate one of the partnership's financial results with Enron's, and it discussed potential conflicts of interest confronting Mr. Fastow. The message was reported yesterday by The Washington Post. 
Yesterday, Andersen issued a statement saying that the deliberations described by the memo were routine and that nothing ''indicated that any illegal actions or improper accounting was suspected.'' 
The firm also acknowledged that senior partners with Andersen in Chicago, where the accounting firm has its headquarters, were involved in the February discussions and held conference calls with the firm's Houston office, which oversaw the Enron account. An Andersen spokesman said it was not unusual for senior partners to be involved in such meetings about clients of Enron's size and complexity. 
Meanwhile, Congressional investigators have also been told that by September, officials from the Chicago office had joined a review team of Andersen auditors in Houston analyzing Enron's dealings with the partnerships in the wake of Ms. Watkins's letter. 
On ''Moneyline'' on CNN last night, Andersen's chief executive, Joseph F. Berardino, said he had been meeting with the firm's partners, other employees and clients to try to reassure them about the firm's prospects. ''We will do what great companies have done: learn from this experience,'' he said. ''Our people are very, very confident that we will move forward.'' 
Until yesterday, it had not been clear just when Ms. Watkins wrote her letter warning of accounting problems or when Mr. Lay received it. But her lawyer, Philip Hilder, said in an interview yesterday that the letter was written on Aug. 15, and one of the newly disclosed Andersen memos obtained by Congressional investigators indicates that her meeting with Mr. Lay had been scheduled for Aug. 22 and the scheduling had been done by Aug. 20. 
It was on Aug. 20 and Aug. 21 that Mr. Lay exercised options on 93,620 shares of stock for $2 million. At the time, the shares were worth $3.5 million. Mr. Lay did not report selling the stock, but a lawyer for Enron disclosed earlier this week that some shares had been used to repay a previously undisclosed loan from Enron. Enron has declined to discuss details of the repayment, but it seems likely that the shares purchased then were used to repay the loan. Had Mr. Lay not planned to use the shares for that purpose, there would have been no apparent reason to exercise the options then. 
Under rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, corporate officials are required to disclose sales of their company's stock by the tenth day of the month after the sale. But there is an exception when the shares are surrendered to the company to repay a loan. Disclosures of such transactions can be delayed until 45 days after the company's fiscal year ends. For Enron, that will be Feb. 14. 
As Mr. Lay was apparently reducing his own stake in Enron, he was sounding optimistic in public. ''As I mentioned at the employee meeting, one of my highest priorities is to restore investor confidence in Enron,'' Mr. Lay wrote in an e-mail message to employees dated Aug. 21. ''This should result in a significantly higher stock price.'' 
An Enron spokesman said last night that Mr. Lay ''exercised the options to hold those shares,'' but that he did not know whether those ''particular'' shares had then been used to repay a company loan. 
Congressional investigators have learned this week that some Enron executives, concerned about the company's finances, sought legal counsel on their own from lawyers outside the company before the financial disclosures last fall that ultimately led to Enron's bankruptcy in December. 
Last night, Salon.com reported that an Enron corporate lawyer, Jordan Mintz, last summer hired a New York law firm, Fried Frank Harris Shriver & Jacobson, to take another look at the company's financial structure. Fried Frank, where the S.E.C. chairman, Harvey L. Pitt, worked until last fall, recommended that Enron end its deals with the partnerships. There was no response to a message left last night at Mr. Mintz's home in Houston. 
The investigation by the Houston law firm of Vinson & Elkins, a result of Ms. Watkins's letter, concluded that Enron had done nothing wrong in setting up the partnerships but also said that there was a serious risk of adverse publicity and litigation for the company. 
In Houston yesterday, investigators of the House Energy and Commerce Committee interviewed Richard Buy, Enron's chief risk officer, among other executives. On Friday they plan to interview Richard Causey, the company's chief accounting officer. Investigators then plan to conduct interviews across the country about document destruction at Andersen. Investigators have also started to receive reconstructed versions of some of the e-mail messages and electronic documents that were destroyed by the accounting firm from September to November. 
On Wednesday, investigators from the committee spent more than four hours interviewing David B. Duncan, the lead Andersen partner in charge of auditing Enron, who was fired earlier this week after the firm said he oversaw document destruction at Andersen's Houston office despite a regulatory investigation. 
Mr. Duncan maintained that he was only following a document-destruction policy re-emphasized in an Oct. 12 memo from an Andersen lawyer, according to a person close to the case. He was asked by investigators whether ''it was usual in your career for people to talk to you about the document-retention policy,'' this person said. ''He said it's not something that happens all the time.'' 
Mr. Duncan also stated that by September, Andersen executives in Chicago were having frequent phone calls with auditors in Houston re-examining Enron's transactions with the partnerships, this person said. 
The internal Andersen documents paint a complicated picture of a firm where accountants were struggling to evaluate the risks posed by Enron's aggressive approach to accounting. The Andersen executives also worried that the fees received from Enron could appear to compromise their objectivity. 
''We arbitrarily discussed that it would not be unforeseeable that fees could reach a $100 million per-year amount considering the multidisciplinary services being provided,'' wrote Michael D. Jones, in Andersen's Houston office. ''Such amount did not trouble the participants so long as the nature of the services was not an issue.'' 
In a statement yesterday, Andersen said that ''discussion about the potential that fees could rise to as much as $100 million was not in the context of the firm's desire to grow revenues.'' 
''Rather,'' it continued, ''the discussion related to concerns about the possibility that the size of the fees could be misperceived as affecting independence.'' 
But Mr. Jones's e-mail message also suggested that Andersen's accountants consider whether the LJM partnerships should be treated as a separate entity for accounting purposes. That suggestion makes clear that nearly a year ago Enron's auditors questioned whether unreported transactions between the company and entities like LJM might be improperly characterized in its financial statements.

Developments involving bankrupt energy company Enron Corp.: 
-Enron Corp. and accounting firm Arthur Andersen LLP are trying to pin responsibility on each other over Enron's financial practices. Enron fired Andersen, citing its destruction of thousands of documents and its accounting advice.
-More than $700,000 in campaign donations has gone from Enron to the members of seven congressional committees investigating its collapse, but none of the lawmakers has decided to drop out of the probe. Some money has been returned. Watchdog groups criticize the lawmakers still involved in the probe. 
The Security and Exchange Commission chief says Enron's collapse was just the latest in a series of horrific accounting failures at big companies. He is calling for a new private-sector agency to regulate the accounting profession. 
-Rep. Henry Waxman, the top Democrat on the House Government Reform Committee, says he documented 17 provisions in Vice President Dick Cheney's energy plan that benefited Enron. The White House refuses Waxman's demands that it list contacts with the bankrupt energy trading company.

Enron fires Andersen 
Board takes action as new facts surface 
By JULIE MASON 
Copyright 2002 Houston Chronicle Washington Bureau 

WASHINGTON -- As evidence surfaced Thursday that Arthur Andersen was worried about Enron Corp.'s accounting and conflicts of interest as early as February, the one-time energy giant fired Andersen as its auditor. 
The action by the Enron board of directors is the latest in a round of firings and recriminations spawned by the collapse of the Houston-based energy company. 
Embattled Enron Chairman Ken Lay, whose own conduct is under intense scrutiny, said company officials are reviewing past Enron accounting practices -- and are now looking to hire new auditors. 
"While we had been willing to give Andersen the benefit of the doubt until the completion of that investigation, we can't afford to wait any longer in light of recent events," Lay said. 
Those events include the apparent destruction of thousands of documents pertaining to Enron by Andersen executives, and firing and disciplinary action taken by Andersen against its employees in charge of Enron's books. 
Andersen officials responded to their firing by Enron with a statement illustrating the growing acrimony between the one-time high-flying allies. 
"As a matter of fact, our relationship with Enron ended when the company's business failed and it went into bankruptcy," the auditors said. 
Investigators from the House Energy and Commerce Committee were in Houston interviewing Enron's former risk assessment officer, Rick Buy, and others as part of a probe of the company's free fall. 
Ken Johnson, chief spokesman for the committee, declined to identify what information was gleaned, but said a key theme is emerging in the investigation. 
"We are now in the middle of a classic `he said, she said,' " Johnson said. 
Committee staffers are expected to remain in Houston through today to interview former Enron chief accounting officer Rick Causey. 
David Duncan, lead Andersen partner on the Enron account and blamed by the firm for ordering the document destruction, has in turn said he was following company policy outlined by the auditors' in-house lawyers. 
Andersen fired Duncan on Tuesday, and the next day Duncan began cooperating with congressional investigators. 
A Feb. 6 memo provided by the House committee shows Andersen officials were concerned nearly a year ago about Enron's accounting methods and possible conflicts of interest. 
"A significant discussion was also held about Enron's (monthly) earnings and the fact that it was `intelligent gambling,' " said the memo, authored by Houston-based Andersen accountant Michael D. Jones and addressed to Duncan. 
The memo, detailing concerns discussed at a meeting of eight Andersen auditors in Houston and six Andersen executives on a conference call, indicates for the first time how long before Enron's Dec. 2 bankruptcy those familiar with its practices were expressing uneasiness. 
Despite the range of misgivings discussed at the meeting, Andersen decided to keep serving Enron, estimating its fees could reach $100 million a year. 
Enron, a major client for the Chicago-based Big Five accounting firm, paid Andersen $52 million last year. 
"Ultimately the conclusion was reached to retain Enron as a client citing that it appeared that we had the appropriate people and processes in place to serve Enron and manage our engagement risks," Jones wrote to Duncan, who participated in the meeting. 
On Oct. 16, Enron released a devastating third-quarter earnings report containing more than $1 billion in losses on bad investments and a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity. 
Enron's losses were tied in part to investment partnerships with LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment. 
Andrew Fastow, Enron's chief financial officer at the time, created and ran those partnerships with the blessing of the board of directors and Lay. 
Fastow's dual roles have led to widespread conflict-of-interest charges, discussed by Andersen in February and now the subject of federal government inquiry. 
Wall Street last year began focusing on Enron's complex accounting methods, scrutinizing financial vehicles and deals Enron used to make various investments without putting the related debt on its balance sheet. 
At the conclusion of the Andersen meeting in February, participants compiled a to-do list that included suggesting the Enron board create a special committee to review the propriety of the Fastow partnerships. 
Nine months later on Nov. 8, Enron acknowledged to the Securities and Exchange Commission that it had overstated its profits by $586 million as it shielded losses in partnerships, including those headed by Fastow. 
The company's subsequent collapse cost thousands of Enron employees their jobs and many their retirement savings. 
Investigations into Enron are under way by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Labor Department, and Justice Department officials have opened a criminal investigation. 
The House Energy and Commerce Committee probe is one of at least nine Enron-related inquiries under way on Capitol Hill. 
Another document provided by House investigators shows that Andersen officials were alerted by an Enron executive in August about possible improprieties in Enron accounting. 
Sherron Smith Watkins, vice president for corporate development, whose Aug. 15 memo to Lay prophesied the accounting scandals that subsequently engulfed the company, called a friend at Andersen to discuss her concerns. 
James A. Hecker, who did not work on the Enron account, drafted a detailed memo Aug. 21 to several Andersen auditors handling the Enron books, detailing Watkins' allegations. 
Hecker described Watkins, also a former Andersen employee, as "agitated" because Enron financial statements did not tell the "whole story." 
According to Hecker, Watkins had been assured by Enron in-house counsel that there was no impropriety in Fastow's partnerships or accounting; however, Watkins wanted to meet with Lay to discuss her concerns. 
Chronicle reporter Dale Lezon in Houston contributed to this story.

In Enron Leaders, Seeing the Worst Of Ourselves

To many, the Enron debacle -- the largest corporate bankruptcy in U.S. history -- is a complex soup whose ingredients boil down to some essential lessons: 
About how money can obliterate corporate executives' good sense. About the dangers of employees putting all their investment money into one seemingly sound basket. About elected officials distancing themselves from a formerly valued contributor -- President Bush's description of embattled Enron CEO Kenneth Lay went from "Kenny Boy" to "Mr. Lay" to "a supporter."
To me, the Enron fiasco boils down to a simple question for everyone who created it: 
"How could you?" 
They're three little words that reflect all the passion and frustration of "I love you" -- and that we think far more often. It's the question we silently ask the boss who passes us over, the co-worker who disrespects us, the child who lies to us with a sweet, open face. 
But considering all we know about human treachery, what's stunning isn't that some people treat us poorly. It's that such behavior surprises us. 
I've wrapped "How could you?" around everyone from commitment-phobic ex-boyfriends, to the car dealer who tried to charge me $1,300 for a repair for which I paid $63 elsewhere, to spy Robert Hanssen for selling classified information that could have threatened his nation's -- and his own family's -- security. 
What other response -- besides a stiff jail sentence -- is more appropriate for Enron officers who apparently made millions selling their own soon-to-be-worthless stock while preventing their employees from doing the same? 
The photos of blank-faced young former employees whose trust in corporate America had evaporated were bad enough. What drove me to "How could you?" was reading about folks like retired pipeline operator Charles Prestwood -- whose $1.3 million 401(k) nest egg in Enron stock is now virtually worthless. 
I mean, how could one Enron official make nearly $63 million in 14 months -- and then watch 20,000 other employees lose their retirement savings? 
How could anyone? 
"It's called sociopathy -- people who don't think about or have much empathy for the impact of their actions on others," says clinical social worker Dennis O'Brien, who often counsels employees of businesses and organizations. 
A Houston native whose neighborhood adjoined that of many Enron honchos, O'Brien sounds as baffled as anyone by certain executives' behavior. 
"These are not the type of people who show up at therapy," he says. "They don't know they have a problem." 
They aren't just in the business world. Years ago, my friend Elizabeth was pregnant with her second child when her husband went off with "friends" to a college reunion. 
"He leaves on Thursday and I don't hear from him the entire weekend," she recalls. "No phone call, nothing. He just shows up Sunday. I was like, 'How could you?' " 
Her husband, who was actually with a lover, told his pregnant wife the affair was her fault because she was "fat." 
But it took Elizabeth seven years to leave him because "I thought it must be something I was doing. . . . I allowed myself to be a victim, but finally realized that what he did was about him. . . . He just doesn't think about how what he's going to do affects other people. 
"That's what Enron did to the people who worked for them," she theorizes. "I used what happened with my ex to learn who I am. I don't know how people victimized by Enron will recoup what they've lost." 
Certainly, Enron's victims have heard enough about what they did wrong. But the rest of us should acknowledge what's tricky about "How could you?" 
Too often, it absolves us from asking another valid question: 
"How could I?" 
"It's sort of like going to a doctor and letting him operate and you don't ask questions or get a second opinion," suggests Shelley Lafall, a Silver Spring artist. "We've learned not to do that. I guess we'll learn some business lessons from Enron." 
But in fact, she continues, "we all do mean stuff all the time, in little ways -- whether it's a waitress you don't give a good tip to or somebody who's bagging your groceries and you're huffing and puffing and looking at your watch." 
Most people, thank God, aren't coldblooded enough to grab millions of dollars and then run. But we'll cut off some perfectly nice person in traffic. 
"Usually, I'll let somebody in -- and give myself Brownie points," Shelley says. "But sometimes, there's this survival instinct that kicks in to look out for number one -- especially when number two is faceless. 
"It's a hardness that fails to recognize someone else's humanity." 
Every jerk responsible for the cosmic horror that is Enron should be soundly punished. Yet Shelley has a point when she suggests that those who ask, "How could you?" are ignoring a basic fact: 
"We're just not that far from our primitive selves."

Broadband-unit hype didn't match reality 
By TOM FOWLER 
Copyright 2002 Houston Chronicle 

A year ago this month, at Enron's annual analysts' meeting at the Four Seasons Hotel in Houston, then-President Jeff Skilling was emphatic about the potential of the company's broadband Internet business. 
At a time when Enron stock was trading in the low $80s, Skilling said the broadband unit alone was worth $40 per share. Enron stock, he said, should be selling for $126. 
That brought a gasp from many of the Enron Broadband Services employees watching the presentation on a webcast. The picture he painted was a far cry from the reality they knew. 
Not only did many of the 2,000 EBS employees have copious time to kill because of a lack of customers, they knew the company was actually trying to sell the very heart of the business -- an 18,000-mile fiber-optic data network, assembled at a cost of $1.5 billion. 
The effort to peddle broadband's one hard asset, known as "Project Cannon," was not shared with analysts or investors, but it started to leak out to employees in December 2000. By March, most employees knew, but few, if any, outsiders did. 
And by April, the company -- while publicly saying it planned to expand the network -- also was trying to quietly sell millions of dollars in computers and telecommunications equipment stockpiled in a warehouse on Shepherd Drive near Interstate 10. 
"There wasn't a whole lot of connection between what the management said and what we knew," said Dixie Yeck, a former trader with EBS. 
Eventually, losses from the broadband business, combined with disclosure of myriad questionable financial transactions, eroded investor confidence in Enron. On Dec. 26, EBS followed 28 other Enron affiliates and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. 
Now, a month after Enron's bankruptcy filing, it's clear that EBS had much in common with the hundreds of dot-com and telecom businesses that folded in the past two years. 
Like dot-coms, EBS always admitted profitability wasn't imminent but would take time, hard work and a lot of investment. And, also like dot-coms, it had a lot of hype, too many employees and not enough paying customers. 
Enron created the broadband business after its 1997 acquisition of Portland General Electric, a small Oregon utility that was also building its own fiber-optic network. Some Enron employees believed they could do just what colleagues had done in the natural gas business a decade earlier -- turn access to the largest Internet data pipelines into a fluid commodity that could be bought and sold on a daily basis. 
By building more than two dozen "pooling points" -- data-switching hubs that connected with other networks around the world -- Enron could sell time over the Internet to send and receive large amounts of data reliably. This included everything from broadcasts of conferences and sporting events to such mundane traffic as vast amounts of arcane business data. 
The business reported steep losses every quarter it was in existence, but it still got points from investors for being a pioneer. 
In the summer of 2000, when it signed a 20-year deal with Dallas-based Blockbuster Inc. to deliver movies over the Internet to homes, EBS became a star and the stock rose to record heights. 
Then-EBS Chief Executive Ken Rice predicted broadband trading would one day equal the company's natural gas retail and wholesale business. 
"A lot of the guys in that division will say `no way,' but there's no doubt to anyone it will be big," Rice said last spring. 
It wasn't. In March 2001, the Blockbuster deal fell apart. Long before that, company insiders said, there were clear signs of trouble. 
Though EBS had plans to increase staff significantly, in early 2000 it started to become a dumping ground for employees cut from operations being downsized or eliminated. Several hundred employees from Enron's faltering water-industry spinoff, Azurix, were transferred to EBS as a way to keep talented workers. 
The influx of new people meant roles and responsibilities changed frequently, said Matt Mitchell, a former sales engineer with the broadband group who was laid off in November. 
For a while there was plenty of work to go around, with customers to find and things to trade. But not all the trades brought in cash. Some, for instance, involved Enron selling access to a particular circuit to Dynegy, which would then sell it to El Paso Corp., which would sell it back to Enron. The transaction could be treated as a trade, but Enron didn't net any cash from it. 
And some of the contracts were so structured that companies would buy long-term broadband access without having to pay for it for years. Such deals were done with startup companies in particular, to enable them to get on their feet without having to lay out cash upfront. 
Enron, however, would book the full value of the contract in the quarter the deal was closed, insiders said, but many customers never got around to paying before going out of business. 
Playing with the numbers wasn't that unusual in EBS, as revelations made in November 2001, after Enron started to come undone, now show. 
According to Securities and Exchange Commission documents, in June 2000, EBS sold an unused portion of its network to LJM2 Co-Investment, one of the now-infamous partnerships that had been formed by then-Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow. 
LJM2 bought the cable for $30 million in cash and $70 million in an interest-bearing note, an IOU. Enron recorded $67 million in pre-tax revenue from the transaction. 
Six months later, LJM2 sold some of that fiber to other companies for $40 million, but because Enron helped market the fiber to those buyers, it received an "agency fee" of $20.3 million. 
That same month, LJM2 sold the remaining fiber for $113 million to a special partnership that Enron had created strictly for the purpose of making that purchase. So even though EBS technically no longer owned those assets, an Enron-controlled partnership did. 
The public record of this flip-flopping of assets wasn't nearly as revealing, however. Financial statements Enron made in early 2001 about the deals simply described it as "the sale of excess dark fiber." 
When the Blockbuster deal fell apart, outsiders started to become more skeptical of Enron's claims about the business. When about 250 employees were cut from EBS a month later, the stock started to drop. 
Analysts said they were never told of plans to sell the network, or even when the company started to sell millions of dollars in Compaq and Sun Microsystems equipment it had bragged about buying a year earlier. 
A company spokeswoman said Enron was continually re-examining whether such hard assets as pipelines or networks were necessary. 
Some analysts agree, saying that not having that information doesn't seem very important, even in hindsight. 
"They always said the important part of the business would be the trading, not the network," said Andre Meade, head of utilities research at Commerzbank Securities. "So getting rid of the assets would eventually be a good move." 
But to John Olson, an analyst with Sanders Morris Harris, the omission of the attempted network sale was significant. 
"The disconnect there was like night and day," Olson said. "How could they get out there and make presentations on their business like they did when they were trying to unload these other assets?"

PREMIER PROPERTIES 
Enron chairman selling 2 homes, lot in Colorado for $16.2 million 
By ED ASHER 
Copyright 2002 Houston Chronicle 

    Joshua & Co. photos  Broker Joshua Saslove, of Aspen, Colo., said his company put Enron Chairman Ken Lay's three properties -- two houses pictured above and a vacant lot -- on the market on Nov. 12, three days after Enron had agreed to be bought by rival energy company Dynegy Inc. 	

Enron Chairman Ken Lay has put three of his four Aspen, Colo., properties up for sale for $16.2 million, or reportedly $3.6 million more than he paid for them since 1998. 
They include a 4,537-square-foot log and stone "cabin-style" home listed at $6.8 million and a 4,559-square-foot riverfront residence listed at $6.5 million. 
Both have hot tubs, security systems and lawn sprinklers. The larger house includes a "caretaker unit," according to the listing. 
The third property is a 20,266-square-foot vacant lot listed at $2.9 million. It has a building permit with plans for a home, said Aspen broker Joshua Saslove, owner of Joshua & Co. 
"They are premier Aspen properties located within walking distance of downtown," he said "We have had a substantial amount of interest in them." 
Lay and his wife, Linda, are not selling a 4,200-square-foot "cottage" they use in the summer and winter, he said. The Pitkin County assessor's office has valued it at $3 million. 
The "cabin-style" home is seven years old and was purchased by the Lays in November 1999. The two-story home has five bedrooms and five bathrooms. 
The other home, with "considerable" frontage on the Roaring Fork River, has four bedrooms and four bathrooms, Saslove said. 
Saslove said his company put the three properties on the market on Nov. 12, three days after Enron had agreed to be bought by rival energy company Dynegy Inc. for $9 billion in stock. Dynegy later backed out of the deal. 
"They seem to be in no great hurry to sell the homes," Saslove said. "But like any seller, I'm sure they would like to see some activity as soon as possible." 
Lay could not be reached for comment late Thursday. 
Saslove said he did not know how much the Lays would profit if all three properties sell at their listed prices. 
However, The Aspen Times said the couple would get a $3.6 million profit before taxes, or a 23 percent return on their investment. 

Report on Business: The Wall Street Journal
Blockbuster deal helped sow seeds of Enron fiasco CIBC World Markets agreed to invest $115.2-million in affiliated partnership

When Enron Corp. and Blockbuster Inc. joined forces in mid-2000, it looked like they were on to something big. The companies announced they would soon be allowing consumers across America to choose from among thousands of movies, including hot new features, sent via telephone lines to watch on their TVs at home. 
Announcing the partnership in July, 2000, Enron chairman Kenneth Lay called it the "killer app for the entertainment industry." Blockbuster chairman John Antioco said the two companies had come up with the "ultimate bricks-clicks-and-flicks strategy." Oracle Corp. chairman Larry Ellison later committed his private company, nCube Corp., to provide critical computer hardware and $2-million (U.S.). Mr. Ellison said he was "proud" to be part of the venture.
It looked like another brilliant move by Enron, already a hero on Wall Street. But within eight months of its launch, the partners had split. Enron's impatience "didn't add up," says Blockbuster spokeswoman Karen Raskopf. 
As it turns out, Blockbuster didn't know the half of it. Within months of inking the deal, Enron had set up an affiliated partnership, code-named Project Braveheart, an apparent allusion to the 1995 Mel Gibson movie. Enron obtained a $115.2-million investment in the partnership from CIBC World Markets, the investment-banking arm of Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in Toronto. In return, CIBC received a promise of almost all earnings from Enron's share of the venture for the first 10 years. Blockbuster didn't know about Braveheart at the time, Ms. Raskopf says. 
The partnership had no separate staff and no assets other than Enron's stake in the venture with Blockbuster, which was barely getting off the ground in late 2000. Still, in an audacious accounting move, Enron claimed $110.9-million in profits from Braveheart in the fourth quarter of 2000 and the first quarter of 2001. That amount sharply limited the overall losses suffered by Enron's fibre-optics division in the two periods. 
At its peak, in March, 2001, the venture with Blockbuster provided only about 1,000 test customers with movies in four U.S. cities. Many of those customers didn't even pay. "It was nothing but a pilot project," says Blockbuster's Ms. Raskopf. "I don't know how anyone could have been booking revenues." 
Blockbuster, a unit of Viacom Inc., never accounted for any financial gain or loss from the short-lived venture, she says. 
Project Braveheart was one of dozens of outside partnerships that Enron officials created to burnish the company's financial results at a time when it felt under pressure to show high profits that would justify its soaring stock price, according to current and former company executives. One of the reasons Enron began sliding toward bankruptcy court last fall was the abandonment of some of these accounting manoeuvres, which contributed to huge losses and the collapse of its stock. 
Some of the partnerships were designed to shift large debts off Enron's balance sheet and make the company appear more robust in the eyes of investors and credit-rating agencies. Others, such as Braveheart, raised fast cash needed to fund Enron's ever-expanding array of new businesses. 
Enron's current chief financial officer, Jeffrey McMahon, says he had nothing to do with Braveheart or related partnerships. "I'm not going to defend them," he says. An Enron spokeswoman says the company has no other comment. 
In exchange for its $115.2-million investment, CIBC was supposed to receive 93 per cent of Braveheart's cash flow for 10 years. But Enron made the investment in the embryonic partnership more attractive by promising to repay CIBC the full value of its investment if the partnership failed to be a money maker. Three former Enron employees familiar with the partnership deals say that this kind of guarantee was designed specifically to attract investors who otherwise might worry about the viability of the deals. 
In late November, CIBC said its total unsecured potential losses related to Enron amounted to $115-million. That amount is roughly equal to the sum CIBC invested in Braveheart. The bank also said it has secured-debt exposure to Enron of another $100-million. Citing "client confidentiality," Rob McLeod, a CIBC spokesman, declined to comment on its investment in Braveheart or other Enron partnerships. 
Separately, three Canadian institutional investors that invested more than $175-million in Enron debt securities in October have filed a wrongful-conduct lawsuit against the company's investment bankers and auditor. The suit, filed Wednesday in federal court in Manhattan, names Citigroup Inc.'s Salomon Smith Barney unit, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Bank of America Corp.'s Banc of America Securities LLC and accounting firm Arthur Andersen LLP. The plantiffs are investment managers based in Toronto: Silvercreek Management Inc. and two of its funds, Onex Industrial Partners Ltd. and Pebble Limited Partnership. 
Bank of America, Goldman and Andersen couldn't be reached for comment. Salomon Smith Barney declined to comment.

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE STRATEGY
Deals That Helped Doom Enron Began to Form in the Early 90's
By KURT EICHENWALD with MICHAEL BRICK

The New York Times

c. 2002 New York Times Company

HOUSTON, Jan. 17 -- The financial dealings that played a central role in Enron's collapse were begun a decade ago, court records show, by a newly hired financial whiz kid in part to keep debt off the company's books so it could grow unimpeded. 
Those early deals by the finance officer, Andrew S. Fastow -- the first links of the complex chain of thousands of partnerships -- were much simpler than the ones that the company developed in the late 1990's. But the records show that they contained many of the hallmarks of the transactions that later helped bring the company to its knees.
Mr. Fastow, now 40, who was ousted in October, has not spoken publicly about the events leading to Enron's downfall. But in a 1997 deposition -- from a lawsuit contending, essentially, that Enron's business model had been stolen from a New York businessman, Bernard H. Glatzer -- Mr. Fastow provided answers to some of the questions that investigators are puzzling over: For example, why were assets of Enron moved into the partnerships? What role did the accountants play? What motivated it to start down a path that ultimately led to its demise? 
In 1991, soon after he joined Enron from Continental Bank in Chicago, Mr. Fastow worked with a group of Wall Street firms to put together a deal, known as Cactus 1, in which interests in natural gas reserves would be packaged and sold to public investors. But that effort was abandoned as Enron realized it would make no money from the transaction, largely because the company could not obtain high enough credit ratings for the securities. 
''Enron would have lost money compared with the transaction we ultimately did,'' Mr. Fastow said in the deposition. 
The deal that finally worked was called Cactus III. Rather than packaging the energy assets for purchase by the public, Mr. Fastow constructed a complex partnership deal for private investors, including the General Electric Credit Corporation and a consortium of banks. 
In describing that transaction in the deposition, Mr. Fastow explained the benefits it brought to Enron -- in particular how it allowed the company to maintain the high credit rating necessary to carry out its business strategy. ''If a company like Enron has too much debt on its balance sheet, then the rating agencies will lower Enron Corp.'s rating,'' Mr. Fastow said. ''So, we endeavor to find ways to finance activities off balance sheet.'' 
Such transactions, which are legal and common in business, offer corporations alternate means of financing, while allowing them to avoid issuing new stock or being weighed down with additional debt. 
''In making things off balance sheet,'' Mr. Fastow said, ''you're actually transferring risks of the transaction to investors. So when you sell something to investors, they take some risk, they earn a return from that risk.'' 
To put together such complex deals, Mr. Fastow said, the company worked hand-in-hand with its auditing firm, Arthur Andersen. 
''We worked very closely with our accountants, making sure that we are never violating any of the rules,'' Mr. Fastow said. 
Ultimately, the decisions by Enron and Andersen to allow certain partnerships to be pushed off the company's balance sheet helped set in motion the events that crippled the energy company. The Cactus III deal involved a comparatively small sum; by last year, the company had moved billions of dollars of assets into partnerships and claimed hundreds of millions of dollars in profits in connection with the deals. 
It was when Enron, under intense pressure from securities regulators and Wall Street, reversed that accounting -- pulling the partnerships back onto its books and eliminating more than $1 billion in shareholder's equity in a single stroke -- that the company went into its death spiral. The resulting crisis in confidence among Enron's investors, its banks and traders in its stock drove the company to file for bankruptcy protection early last month. 
There is little in the deposition's description of the early days of Mr. Fastow's tenure that indicated the troubles to come. 
Mr. Fastow was brought into the company as a manager of its Enron Finance Corporation and eventually was promoted to chief financial officer. Since the debacle, some of his superiors have maintained that they had little knowledge of Mr. Fastow's activities. But the partnership transactions were reviewed by Arthur Andersen and senior officers of Enron. Moreover, the Enron board waived the company's conflict of interest policy to allow Mr. Fastow to manage some of the partnerships, dealings that brought him at least $30 million. 
The lawsuit in which Mr. Fastow testified was originally brought by Mr. Glatzer against one of Enron's bankers and some individuals. A federal judge ruled in favor of the defendants in 1998, but motions for a rehearing are pending. With the Cactus III transaction, according to Mr. Fastow's testimony, two classes of investments were created. The first, Class A, was bought by what is known as a special purpose vehicle -- a legal entity whose operations are limited to the acquisition and financing of specific assets. That structure provides lenders with greater security that they will get their money back even if a parent company goes bankrupt. 
The special purpose vehicle borrowed money from a consortium of banks, leaving it with the obligation to repay those loans. The borrowed money was then used to purchase all of the Class A securities in Cactus III. Those securities, in turn, paid interest which was used to repay the banks for their loans. 
That structure, Mr. Fastow said, ''was a conduit, in a sense, just a way for the banks to loan money instead of owning'' a direct stake in the partnership. 
The second group of securities, Class B, was far less complex. They were sold directly to General Electric Credit, which in return received interest on the investment at a rate that fluctuated. 
The structure allowed Enron to make money through a series of new transactions. Cactus III now effectively owned certain gas reserves. Enron sold a contract, committing it to sell the gas at some future point, Mr. Fastow said. Enron then bought the gas from Cactus III, and used it to meet the contract's obligations. 
''Hopefully they find a way to sell the gas for more than they purchased the gas,'' Mr. Fastow said. 
In the end, Mr. Fastow said, the deal was an all-around benefit for Enron. 
''Did I raise money in a cost-efficient manner?'' Mr. Fastow asked. ''I believe the answer is yes. I argue that because I did it. I want people to think I did a good job.''

Enron deals that led to collapse began in early 1990s - report

01/18/2002
AFX News
(c) 2002 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

NEW YORK (AFX) - The transactions that helped push Enron Corp into bankruptcy date back to the early 1990s, to the hiring of finance officer Andrew Fastow who developed methods of keeping debt off the company books to allow Enron to grow unimpeded, the New York Times reported, citing court records. 
The report said: "The first links of the complex chain of thousands of partnerships were much simpler than the ones that the company developed in the late 1990s. But the records show that they contained many of the hallmarks of the transactions that later helped bring the company to its knees."
Fastow, now 40 years old, was ousted in October and has not spoken publicly about the events leading to Enron's downfall, the newspaper said. 
However, in a 1997 court case deposition, Fastow acknowledged that Enron began creating intricate partnership relationships because "Enron would have lost money compared with the transaction we ultimately did."

FRONT PAGE - FIRST SECTION - Andersen HQ 'discussed Enron purge'.
By ADRIAN MICHAELS, PETER SPIEGEL and PETER THAL LARSEN.

Officials at Andersen's head office in Chicago took part in regular conference calls and discussed destroying documents with the firm's Enron auditors in Houston in the weeks leading up to the purge, Congressional investigators have learnt. 
The discussions threaten to ruin attempts by Andersen to contain the Enron damage to a few people in its Houston office. Investigators are focusing on high-level, regular contacts between David Duncan, the lead Enron auditor fired by Andersen this week, members of his team and senior staff in Chicago.
Mr Duncan told investigators that from mid-September, sometimes two or three times a week, there were conference calls involving between six and eight people, half of whom were based in Chicago. The group referred to itself as the "expanded review team" and discussed matters relating to the now-discredited accounting at Enron. 
Enron filed for the largest corporate bankruptcy in the US on December 2. Its downfall has led to a criminal investigation by the Justice Department and inquiries by the Securities and Exchange Commission and Congress. 
President George W. Bush has attempted to stop the fallout spreading to the White House as the energy trader's ties to prominent Republicans are being probed. 
Andersen said when it fired Mr Duncan on Tuesday that he had organised the destruction of thousands of Enron documents. It said the destruction was "undertaken without any consultation with others in the firm". 
According to people close to the investigations, Mr Duncan has described detailed communications with head office. He believes he is being hung out to dry as Andersen attempts to keep its clients and preserve its integrity. 
Nancy Temple, an in-house lawyer in Chicago, was often on the calls, Mr Duncan said. She sent a memo to Houston on October 12, after calls had taken place. The memo directed the auditors to the company's document retention policies. According to Mr Duncan, John Stewart, director of accounting principles in Andersen's Professional Standards Group in Chicago, also took part in calls. 
Andersen staff in Chicago did not immediately return calls. Staff in the Houston office referred enquiries to Andersen head office, which also did not return calls. 
Joining Mr Duncan on the calls from Houston were some staff put on leave or stripped of their management responsibilities by Andersen this week.

Attorneys for Enron assure judge more documents won't be shredded

Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

HOUSTON (AP) - After Enron Corp.'s accountants shredded thousands of documents during the company's collapse, attorneys for Arthur Andersen moved to reassure a judge that no more data will be shredded. 
The Houston Federation of Teachers, whose members had $30 million in pension funds invested in Enron stock, have sued for a court order to prevent more of the energy trader's documents from being destroyed.
Attorney Rusty Hardin on Thursday told State District Judge Caroline Baker he would not enter the statement as an official agreement because he believes federal courts have jurisdiction over the issue. 
George Fleming, representing the federation's members and other investors in Enron stock, filed an amended lawsuit Wednesday requesting a restraining order to stop any further document tampering and prevent further payouts to Enron executives except for the normal course of business. 
The lawsuit names company executives and the Arthur Andersen firm, which has said its employees destroyed Enron-related financial records. 
Hardin and Andy Ramzel, his co-counsel, argued against further action in Baker's court because the matter belongs before a federal bankruptcy judge where Enron's case is pending. 
But Fleming told Baker, "Arthur Andersen did not file bankruptcy. This is a separate proceeding." 
Attorney Melanie Gray, representing Enron, argued that the debtor's rights to control its own assets must be protected. 
Fleming's co-counsel, Anne Ferazzi, responded, "Arthur Andersen is a nondebtor third party and is not entitled to (Enron's) bankruptcy protection." 
Baker asked attorneys to expand a list of case citings for her to examine and will reconvene the hearing at 4 p.m. Friday. 
The teachers group does not make direct investments for its approximate 5,700 members. Teachers in Texas pay into the Teacher Retirement System, and the money goes into a pension fund and is invested.

When Rules Keep Debt Off the Books --- Did Andersen Act Properly? Firm Is Fired
By Ken Brown and Henny Sender
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

01/18/2002
The Wall Street Journal

(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

The once-cozy relationship between Enron Corp. and its auditor blew up in a storm of recriminations yesterday amid questions about what Andersen should have done about questionable practices at the energy company. 
Enron's board fired its longtime auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP. While it said it wanted to give Andersen the benefit of the doubt during the investigation, "we can't afford to wait any longer in light of recent events, including the reported destruction of documents by Andersen personnel and the disciplinary actions taken against several of Andersen's partners working in its Houston office."
In a statement released later, Andersen fired back: "As a matter of fact, our relationship with Enron ended when the company's business failed and it went into bankruptcy. Andersen is committed to continuing to address the issues related to the collapse of Enron in a forthright and candid manner." 
The move by Enron, previously one of Andersen's biggest clients, comes as the spotlight of the investigation has shifted to Andersen. In addition to the firm's destruction of documents, Andersen has come under fire for signing off on accounting practices related to partnerships with which Enron did business. The partnerships allowed Enron to keep debt off its balance sheet. 
Yesterday, yet another internal Andersen memo was released by congressional investigators concerning Andersen discussions of the Enron partnerships. Enron's publicly filed financial statements included references to the partnerships going back to 1999, meaning Andersen was long aware of at least some of Enron's accounting issues. The newly released memos show that in February 2001, Andersen executives held what one executive called "significant" discussions about conflicts related to the partnerships and myriad other issues that eventually contributed to Enron's collapse. 
The question that Andersen now faces is: What should it have done differently? 
Accounting and corporate-governance specialists say it should have done more -- but that it didn't is typical. Until late in the game for Enron -- just a month before it filed for bankruptcy-court protection -- Andersen did what most accounting firms do when up against an important client with "aggressive" accounting practices: It stuck by its client. 
The earliest known Andersen memo referencing accounting issues at Enron is a Feb. 6, 2001, e-mail that summed up a meeting in which senior Andersen partners in Houston and in its Chicago headquarters discussed if they should keep Enron as a client. In that memo, an Andersen auditor laid out nearly every accounting issue that would later play a role in Enron's collapse. But the participants in the meeting decided that Andersen "had the appropriate people and processes in place to serve Enron and manage our engagement risks." The memo cites the large fees -- $100 million a year at some point in the future -- that Enron, a $52-million-in-fees client in 2000, was expected to generate. 
It is rare that big accounting firms ditch clients. "There is almost no turnover among Fortune 50 companies and their accountants; they seem merged at the hip," says Dan Goldwasser, a lawyer with Vedder Price Kaufman & Kammholz in New York. "Does it bother me? I guess it does." Andersen had audited Enron since the energy company was formed in a 1985 merger. 
In a separate statement released yesterday, Andersen said, "Nothing in the [February] meeting or the memo [summarizing it] indicated that any illegal actions or improper accounting was suspected." It said the reference to $100 million in fees "was not in the context of the firm's desire to grow revenues," but whether the large fees would be wrongly perceived as compromising it. 
Andersen's statement added it wasn't until August, when a whistle-blower surfaced at Enron, "that we became aware that individuals within Enron believed that there may have been accounting improprieties." The statement doesn't elaborate on what Andersen did over the next several months. 
Congressional investigators also released an Aug. 21 memo, which summarizes a conversation between an Andersen audit partner who wasn't on the Enron account, and Sherron Watkins, the Enron whistleblower, outlining her concerns about Enron's accounting. Ms. Watkins, one of several Andersen auditors who had gone to work for Enron, in particular expressed worries about the partnerships and then-Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow's involvement in them. The partner passed that information on to several Enron auditors at Andersen and to the firm's lawyers, according to the memo. 
More information about what Andersen knew could come out soon. Congressional investigators received two new boxes of documents from Andersen yesterday, including copies of destroyed documents recovered from Andersen's computer systems. The boxes contain mostly e-mail, mainly from David Duncan, Andersen's lead auditor on the Enron assignment until he was fired Tuesday. Congressional investigators plan to meet today with Richard Causey, Enron's longtime chief accounting officer and a former Andersen auditor. 
Some observers argue that given all the questions surrounding the partnerships, Andersen should have voiced concerns to the audit committee of Enron's board earlier than it apparently did -- Nov. 2. "Basically, they have an obligation to go to the board of directors, particularly the audit committee of the board, when they come up with anything suspicious or anything controversial or anything that could have been a potential problem," says John Nash, president emeritus of the National Association of Corporate Directors. 
--- Unraveling Andersen's Involvement

Some of the events that came to light recently involving Enron
auditor Arthur Andersen

Feb. 5, 2001: Arthur Andersen officials discuss Enron's "aggressive"
accounting practices and potential conflicts of interest at a meeting
to decide whether to retain the energy-trading company as a client. An 
internal memo, drafted Feb. 6, recounts the executives' discussion of
many of the alleged problems that have become the focus of
investigations into Enron's collapse. The memo was addressed to two
Andersen officials, including David Duncan, who headed the Enron
account.

August 2001: Enron Vice President Sherron Watkins, a former Andersen
employee, writes anonymously to Chairman and CEO Kenneth Lay with
concerns about potential conflicts of interest and accounting
practices.

Aug. 20, 2001: Date of, according to a second memo by another
Andersen executive, a phone conversation between Watkins and an
Andersen employee, who relays the issues to senior Andersen
management, including Duncan.

Fall 2001: Vinson & Elkins, Enron's law firm, conducts a preliminary
investigation into Watkins's charges.

Oct. 12, 2001: E-mail by in-house Andersen lawyer Nancy Temple
reminds risk-management partner Michael Odom of document-and-retention 
policy. Temple later tells Andersen that she intended to refer only to
work in progress.

Dec. 2, 2001: Enron files for bankruptcy-court protection.
Investigators focus on Andersen's role.

Jan. 10, 2002: Andersen discloses to investigators that "a
significant but undetermined number" of documents relating to the
Enron audit had been destroyed in recent months.

Jan. 15, 2002: Andersen fires Duncan, saying that he led "an
expedited effort to destroy documents" after he learned "that Enron
had received a request for information from the SEC about its
financial accounting and reporting."

Jan. 16, 2002: Duncan is questioned by the House Energy and Commerce
Committee and the Justice Department, mostly about the February 2001
memo. Duncan tells the investigators he called the February meeting
because he was aware the Enron account posed "significant risk,"
according to one person present during the questioning.

Jan. 17, 2002: Enron fires Arthur Andersen.

Slugfest Is Seen Among Creditors Fighting for Slice of Enron Assets
By Wall Street Journal staff reporters Mitchell Pacelle, Henny Sender and Rebecca Smith

01/18/2002
The Wall Street Journal

There could be less money available to Enron Corp. creditors than they had originally hoped. 
As thousands of Enron creditors began jousting for a piece of the energy company's assets, those owed money -- totaling billions of dollars -- increasingly are concerned about the likely size of the recovery.
Indeed, there is a growing appreciation that the firm funded some of its growth by setting up financing vehicles and partnerships to which it pledged billions of dollars in assets in exchange for cash, upfront. That may leave fewer assets now to divide among creditors. 
When Enron and some of its units filed for bankruptcy-court protection on Dec. 2, they listed assets totaling about $50 billion and debts of $13.15 billion, not including several billion more in off-balance sheet debt -- making it the largest-ever U.S. bankruptcy. But more units since have joined the proceedings, and the company still is completing its internal analysis of "financing structures and claims," noted its chief financial officer, Jeffrey McMahon. Its debt level, creditors fear, may now be higher than the original tally. 
Whatever the final number, Enron's creditors are expected to fight for their piece of the shrinking pie. "There's going to be a huge grab for this cash," predicted George Hickox, chief executive of Wiser Oil Co., which is owed about $7 million on energy contracts with Enron's trading operation. "This case is going to dissolve into liquidation and litigation," he said. 
It is too early to predict whether Enron will be able to implement its preliminary plan to reorganize as a smaller entity under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, or if it will have to be liquidated altogether. The company has until early April to file a formal plan of reorganization that it will present to the court. Mr. McMahon, the chief financial officer, says he still feels strongly that "liquidation of assets is the worst option for everyone" and wants to see the company recapitalized. 
Yet Enron already has faced setbacks that could make it harder to survive bankruptcy. Enron's advisers failed to persuade Swiss bank UBS AG, which recently agreed to take over Enron's trading business, to give Enron a 49% stake in the future business, settling instead for a smaller royalty stream. And Enron surrendered to Dynegy Inc. its most valuable pipeline system, Northern Natural Gas, which was supposed to become a core piece of the reorganized firm. 
"Whether or not Enron is going to reorganize or liquidate is the question of the day," said lawyer Thomas Lauria of White & Case, which represents Mirant Corp., an energy concern that is an Enron creditor. 
Creditors have good reason to question the value of assets available to the bankruptcy estate. Through a series of partnerships and "special purpose entities," beginning in the mid- to late-1990s, Enron quietly pledged assets as well as the expected revenue streams of many of its investments. For example, it formed separate partnerships around some European power assets, the expected revenue from a video-on-demand venture with Blockbuster Inc., a pulp mill, various commodities contracts, "dark" broadband fiber and the like. 
Mr. McMahon said the company still is going through its many "finance vehicles" to determine their impact on the bankruptcy estate. "It's early days in terms of a reorganization plan," he said, adding that the firm expects to work closely with creditors to see that they are paid as much as possible. He also added that "we still have lots that's not tied up in" partnerships and other arrangements. 
The company's fate rests in part on gaining cooperation from the 15-member creditors' committee appointed by the U.S. trustee to represent the interests of all creditors. But already questions have been raised about whether the makeup of the panel, which includes J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc., fairly represents the interests of all creditor constituencies. 
"How would you feel if you were owed $16 million by Enron North America [a trading subsidiary], and the creditors' committee was controlled by money-center banks that have all these cozy relationships with Enron Corp.?" asked John Nabors, a lawyer representing Exco Resources Inc., a Dallas oil-and-gas production firm that is owed $16 million on trading positions with Enron North America. "It makes me real nervous. I find it hard to believe they're looking after my interests," he said. 
Nonsense, counters a representative of the creditors' panel. Luc Despins of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy, lawyer for the committee, strongly disputed that the money-center banks control the group, noting that each member has a single vote, and that creditors of Enron's trading business have three seats on the panel. "All committee members," he said, "have the interests of all creditors at heart." 
--- Bankruptcy Chapters: Eleven or Seven?

One of the primary purposes of bankruptcy is discharging debts to
give a debtor a `fresh financial start' by extinguishing the debtor's
personal liability on dischargeable debts.

Chapter 11

-- Frequently referred to as `reorganization' and generally used to
reorganize a business.
-- Individuals with large federal or state tax obligations may use
Chapter 11 because an extended period of time may be obtained for the
repayment of the taxes.
-- Generally allows the debtor to continue business operations while
proceeding with a confirmed Plan of Reorganization, which must meet
certain statutory criteria. One rationale for business reorganizations 
is that the value of a business as an ongoing concern is greater than
it would be if its assets were liquidated and sold.
-- Firms can liquidate; they don't necessarily go into chapter 7 to
liquidate.

Chapter 7

-- The Bankruptcy Code's liquidation chapter, sometimes referred to
as a `straight bankruptcy.'
-- Used primarily by individuals who wish to free themselves of debt
simply and inexpensively, but also may be used by businesses that wish 
to liquidate and terminate their business.
-- To qualify for relief, the debtor must be an individual,
partnership or corporation.
-- Relief is available under Chapter 7 regardless of the amount of
the debtor's debts, or whether the debtor is solvent or insolvent.

ENRON FIRES ACCOUNTANTS ; DISMISSAL A MOVE OF DESPERATION, EXPERTS SAY
James T. Madore and Elaine S. Povich National Correspondents

01/18/2002
South Florida Sun-Sentinel
Broward Metro

(Copyright 2002 by the Sun-Sentinel)

Enron Corp., faced with a mushrooming financial scandal, Thursday night fired accounting firm Arthur Andersen for destroying potentially incriminating documents last fall. 
The dramatic move, severing a relationship that went back more than a decade, came two days after Andersen's top brass acknowledged that partners in its Houston office ordered the destruction of documents and deletion of e-mails about Enron's financial affairs after learning of a federal investigation. Andersen on Tuesday fired its lead partner who supervised the Enron audits and disciplined seven others.
Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay cited the recent revelations of misconduct by Andersen as justification for ending what had been a close relationship between the two companies. 
"We can't afford to wait any longer in light of recent events," said Lay, who has been criticized for not warning Enron investors and employees of its imminent collapse into bankruptcy last fall. He pledged to begin a search for new auditors immediately. 
Andersen officials ridiculed their dismissal. 
"As a matter of fact, our relationship with Enron ended when the company's business failed and it went into bankruptcy," the Chicago- based accounting giant said in a statement. Bankruptcy court documents show that Andersen is owed almost $2 million by Enron. 
Experts described Enron's jettisoning of Andersen as a "desperate move" designed to protect the company from lawsuits and criminal sanctions. They also said it took chutzpah, because Andersen auditors repeatedly warned Enron management about accounting irregularities involving off-the-book partnerships. 
"This is a significant development, but it's surprising that Enron is dumping Arthur Andersen rather than the other way around," said Leo Stevenson, a law professor at Western Michigan University's Haworth College of Business. "This reminds me of when bank robbers agreed to stick together until they are caught, and then it's everybody for themselves." 
Protecting interests 
Enron, the seventh-largest U.S. corporation, filed for bankruptcy Dec. 2. Earlier, stock in the one-time Wall Street darling plummeted after Enron admitted that accounting errors would cause it to restate earnings for the past five years. Andersen reportedly had demanded the restatements, but the news wiped out the investments of shareholders and employees, because it sent Enron shares into a free fall. 
These developments attracted the attention of investigators at the Securities and Exchange Commission and later on Capitol Hill. In recent days, Andersen officials have scrambled to safeguard the firm's reputation for integrity, the most important asset for auditors of public companies. 
"There's so much bad going around that everybody is trying to protect themselves, and that's what Enron did in firing Andersen," Stevenson said. He also said Andersen employees now would be free to cooperate with federal investigators. "This lessens the relationship and increases the likelihood that both parties will look out for their own vested interests, not those of anyone else." 
In Washington Thursday, congressional investigators were looking at the relationship, questioning why Andersen had chosen to continue working for Enron. The investigators noted that in February 2001, senior Andersen managers were aware of irregularities at Enron and debated whether to drop the company as a client. Internal Andersen memos, made public on Thursday, showed Andersen executives were concerned that Enron was hiding much of its debts. 
The documents also indicated that Lay, Enron's chairman, disposed of stock within days of receiving a letter in August warning him of accounting problems. 
Memos studied 
House investigators focused on a Feb. 6 e-mail from Michael Jones, a senior accountant in Andersen's Houston office, to other senior Andersen officials, reporting on a meeting convened the day before on whether to retain Enron as a client. In the memo, Jones said there were "significant" discussions about Enron's financial activities. But in the end, the Andersen officials decided to continue to serve Enron, perhaps, in part, because of the estimated $100 million in annual fees the account was bringing in, according to the memo. 
In a letter to Andersen chief executive Joseph Berardino, House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Billy Tauzin, R-La., and Rep. John Dingell of Michigan, the committee's highest-ranking Democrat, asked for all records related to the Feb. 5 meeting, along with all documents relating to subsequent meetings and actions involving the Enron account. 
On Wednesday, committee investigators interviewed former Andersen partner David Duncan, who was in charge of the Enron account and who was fired the day before by Andersen, after it was revealed he directed the document destruction. 
Committee officials said Duncan's interview led to the questions about the client retention meeting and the subsequent e-mail. 
In addition, the committee released an Aug. 21 memo from Andersen partner James Hecker saying he had been contacted by Enron whistleblower Sherron Watkins. Watkins first warned Lay about improper accounting practices in a letter, also dated Aug. 21, which has been provided to congressional investigators. She then, apparently, contacted Andersen. 
Andersen's Jones, in detailing the "client retention" meeting in the e-mail, noted that questions were raised about possible conflicts of interest of Andrew Fastow, former chief financial officer of Enron, who has been described as central to the web of partnerships that kept loans and losses off Enron's public accounting statements. He was placed on leave in October. 
James T. Madore and Elaine S. Povich write for Newsday, a Tribune Co. newspaper. Information from The New York Times was used to supplement this report.

Caption: ENRON NOTEBOOK Energy plan helped Enron Rep. Henry Waxman, the top Democrat on the House Government Reform Committee, says he documented 17 provisions in Vice President Dick Cheney's energy plan that benefited Enron. The White House refuses Waxman's demands that it list contacts with the bankrupt energy trading company. Among the examples provided by Waxman: energy deregulation initiatives, support for trading in energy derivatives, proposals to facilitate natural gas projects, the granting of eminent domain so power lines could be built more quickly and spur development in India. Donations aided committee members Members of seven congressional committees investigating the Enron collapse took $700,000 in campaign donations from the company over the past dozen years. Some have returned the money, but none has stepped aside from the inquiry. For sale: Three of Lay's houses The embattled chairman of Enron Corp. has put three of his four Aspen, Colo., properties up for sale, asking a total of more than $15 million. The properties, owned by Kenneth Lay and his wife, Linda, include two single-family homes and an undeveloped lot, Aspen broker Joshua Saslove said. SEC boss says he's keeping distance Harvey Pitt, the Securities and Exchange Commission chairman who once represented collapsed Enron's auditor, said he has no involvement in the watchdog agency's inquiry beyond voting to authorize it. Task force close to offering ideas Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill said his Cabinet task force hoped to present its initial recommendations to President Bush within the next few days. He said that Labor Department staffers had begun studying issues surrounding protection of employee's 401(k) plans "months ago," before the Dec. 2 bankruptcy filing of Enron, but was directed by Bush to see if current laws need to be strengthened in light of the substantial losses suffered by thousands of former Enron employees.

CONGRESS WANTS ANDERSEN TO PROVIDE MORE BOOKKEEPING DATA ENRON SEVERS RELATIONS WITH ITS ACCOUNTING FIRM
H. JOSEF HEBERT, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

01/18/2002
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
REGION
A-12
(Copyright 2002)

Enron fired accounting firm Arthur Andersen yesterday as the feuding corporations both came under growing scrutiny for their roles in the collapse of the world's largest energy trading company. 
Enron cited Andersen's destruction of thousands of documents and its accounting advice. For its part, Andersen said its relationship with Enron ended in December when the company filed for bankruptcy.
"We can't afford to wait any longer," Enron chairman Kenneth Lay said in a statement, announcing that Enron's board of directors had dismissed Andersen. 
Enron's announcement came just hours after the House Energy and Commerce Committee demanded that Andersen provide more documents detailing what the auditors knew about Enron's use of questionable partnership to keep hundreds of millions of dollars in debt off the company's books. 
Patrick Dorton, a spokesman for Anderson, said the accounting firm remained "committed to continuing to address the issues related to the collapse of Enron in a forthright and candid manner." 
As to Andersen's dismissal by Enron, Dorton said, "As a matter of fact, our relationship with Enron ended when the company's business failed and it went into bankruptcy." 
Andersen has acknowledged that it destroyed Enron-related documents, possibly as early as last September. Lay cited the document shredding and Andersen's firing of the head of its Enron account as reasons for dismissing the firm. 
Ten congressional committees are investigating the Enron collapse as well as Andersen's auditing of the energy company. The Enron bankruptcy has left thousands of workers without jobs and their retirement money -- much of it in Enron stock -- essentially gone. Enron filed for bankruptcy Dec. 2 as its stock fell from $83 a share a year ago to less than a dollar. 
Documents obtained by House investigators have shown that Andersen had concern at least a year ago about some of Enron's business practices and that its use of partnership might pose problems with federal regulators. 
During a high-level meeting in early February, Andersen executives expressed concern about Enron's off-the-books accounting of profits from its partnerships, especially one headed by Andy Fastow, at the time also Enron's chief financial officer. 
Summarizing the meeting, Andersen accountant Michael Jones wrote in an e-mail that the discussions "focused on Fastow's conflicts of interest ... and the amount of earnings Fastow receives" from the partnership while also Enron's financial officer. 
Another document obtained by House investigators disclosed that Andersen officials were told last August by Enron whistle-blower Sherron Watkins of her serious concerns about the off-the-books deals at Enron and that the company "will implode in a wave of accounting scandals." 
However, Andersen decided to continue to serve Enron, noting that the fees from the Enron account could reach $100 million a year and that the risks posed by Enron's business practices could be managed. 
The Jones memo went to David Duncan, who headed the Enron account for Andersen and earlier this week was fired by the accounting firm. 
Jones suggested that Andersen further investigate whether the Securities and Exchange Commission might have problems with Enron's use of its partnerships. Duncan has told House investigators that no such investigation was pursued. 
Enron on Nov. 8 acknowledged to the SEC that it had overstated its profits by $586 million as it shielded losses in the complex partnerships, including the one headed by Fastow. 
SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt yesterday declined any comment on the recent Enron disclosures. 
Andersen, in a statement, characterized the February 2001 meeting about Enron as not unusual and said its purpose was to provide a general review of the Enron account. 
"Nothing in the meeting or the memo indicated that any illegal actions or improper accounting was suspected," said the Andersen statement.

Andersen execs aired concerns ; Enron `intelligent gambling' was topic in February

Andersen's troubles continued to worsen Thursday as it became clear that several top executives in the Chicago headquarters knew as early as February of the controversial partnerships that ultimately led to the energy trader's collapse. 
Also Thursday, Enron said its board voted to fire the accounting giant as the company's auditor, effective immediately. In light of disclosures that Andersen executives destroyed documents sought in the government investigation of the Houston-based company, Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay said in a statement, "We can't afford to wait any longer."
But the firing was an empty gesture, according to Andersen Chief Executive Joseph Berardino, since the business relationship between the two firms ended when Enron filed the largest corporate bankruptcy ever on Dec. 12. 
Seeking to defend the embattled accounting firm, Berardino said in an interview Thursday that he was unaware until a few days ago that Sherron Watkins, a top executive of Enron, had raised questions about the accounting treatment of the company's finances. 
He also said a high-level review of the Enron account conducted nearly a year ago in which Andersen executives described the energy company's trading activity as "intelligent gambling" was performed merely in the normal course of business. 
The Big Five accounting firm has faced harsh criticism in recent weeks for its handling of Enron's books. It faces investigations by the Justice Department, the Labor Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission and several congressional panels. 
Andersen said Tuesday it would fire David B. Duncan, the partner in charge of the account, for ordering the destruction of documents. It also suspended three other partners and announced plans for a new management team in its Houston office. 
Duncan was among those participating in the Feb. 5 meeting in which key Chicago- and Houston-based partners discussed Andersen's potential conflicts and those of Enron's chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. 
The next day, Andersen partner Michael Jones described the meeting in an e-mail to Duncan and Thomas Bauer, one of those suspended Tuesday. 
The e-mail highlighted concerns about what was described as "Fastow's conflicts of interest" in heading one of Enron's off- balance sheet partnerships, known as LJM. Andersen partners also questioned the veracity of Fastow's income from LJM. 
LJM and other similar partnerships played a key role in the collapse of the energy trader, carrying huge amounts of debt that were kept out of public view in its books. 
Among those described as "attendees" via phone were Steve Samek, Andersen's U.S. country managing partner; Gregory Jonas, the firm's audit division chief; and Robert Kutsenda, the firm's global risk management head. 
The partners discussed the level of fees Andersen would get for conducting audit, consulting and internal work for Enron--a relationship critics say was fraught with potential for conflicts. 
"We arbitrarily discussed that ... fees could reach a $100 million- per-year amount considering the multidisciplinary services being provided," Jones wrote. "Such amount did not trouble participants as long as the nature of the services was not an issue," the e-mail stated. 
Berardino said the meeting was a normal part of handling any audit. "Every year we evaluate every client," said Berardino. "We assess the risk of the client, the issues of the client, the people assigned to the client. The memo is frankly a normal part of our process. It was no secret in our firm." 
Berardino said he could not provide "an exact date" when the Chicago headquarters first became aware of the concerns raised in the e-mail about Enron. "We have accounting experts that continually consult, not just with Enron but with all our clients all over the U.S., on highly complex accounting issues. They just happen to be located in Chicago." 
Separately Thursday, Andersen sent the House Energy and Commerce Committee two new boxes of documents that contained, among other things, some e-mails written by Duncan that were deleted and then recovered, according to Ken Johnson, a spokesman for the panel. 
In Houston, a team of committee investigators interviewed Rick Buy, Enron's risk assessment officer, Johnson said. The investigators plan to interview Richard Causey, Enron's chief accounting officer, on Friday. 
"Our investigators will be fanning out around the country interviewing people who may have some knowledge of the document destruction," he said. 
The committee on Thursday also released the full text of an Aug. 21 memo written by Andersen audit partner James Hecker. 
That memo revealed the details of a conversation between Hecker, who was not involved in the Enron account, and Watkins, the Enron corporate vice president who attempted to warn Enron's Lay about the energy trader's perilous financial practices. 
Watkins had sought out Hecker, a social acquaintance, as a "sounding board." 
According to the memo, Watkins' consternation was heavily focused on the LJM partnership and Fastow's involvement with it. At the time of her conversation with Hecker, Watkins worked for Fastow.

Andersen: No Sign Of 'Any Illegal Action' At Feb 5 Mtg
By Judith Burns

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
(This report was first published late Thursday.) 

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Arthur Andersen LLP said a meeting last year to discuss Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) was a routine matter and wasn't driven by suspicions of illegal or improper accounting.
"This was a routine, required meeting consistent with our policies and practices," Andersen said in a statement issued late Thursday. Nothing at the February 5, 2001, meeting or follow-up memos indicated "any illegal actions or improper accounting was suspected," Andersen added. 
Andersen audited Enron's books and congressional investigators have asked it to provide details on the meeting and a memo summarizing it. Andersen said it provided the memo to investigators voluntarily, stressing it made "no effort to conceal this information." 
According to the memo, Andersen officials discussed whether fees paid to the firm by Enron might pose an "independence issue." 
The memo also flagged other items of discussion, including Enron's "aggressive" structuring of transactions and its "intelligent gambling" on mark-to-market accounting. 
"The memo was prepared to document our annual risk assessment of the Enron engagement," Andersen said. 
The Chicago-based Big Five firm said it reviews major accounts annually to determine if the firm wants to retain them as clients. 
If a client is found to be too risky, Andersen said it may resign as its auditor, something it has done hundreds of times in recent years. In other cases, it said the firm will agree to keep a riskier client, but may add more auditors, procedures or controls. 
Meeting to discuss Enron's risks wasn't unusual, Andersen said. Similarly, it said the fact that a number of audit partners took part in the meeting, in person or by phone, wasn't out of the ordinary. 
Discussion of related party transactions with off-the-books partnerships tied to Enron chief financial officer Andrew Fastow, and their materiality to Enron's own financial reports, was done "to be sure we had considered all the issues," Andersen continued. 
While auditors commented that "Enron is aggressive in its transaction structuring," Andersen said discussion centered on whether "appropriate parties within the firm were being consulted" to ensure judgments were "informed and correct." 
Fees also were discussed, but Andersen said a $100 million figure wasn't tossed out as a possible target for revenue growth, but was mentioned to highlight concerns that having such a lucrative client could be "misperceived." 
Talk of fees centered on "making sure the nature of the firm's services did not compromise independence," the audit firm said. 
Ultimately, according to its memo, Andersen decided "to retain Enron as a client," judging that "we had appropriate people and processes in place to serve Enron and manage our engagement risks."

House Panel Wants Documents On Andersen's Feb Enron Talks

01/18/2002
Dow Jones Energy Service

(This article was originally published Thursday) 

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Arthur Andersen's death by a thousand cuts continued apace Thursday, as a House investigating panel issued a new request for documents related to the Big Five auditing firm's discussions last February about whether to retain Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) as a client.
As disclosed by the House Energy and Commerce Committee late Wednesday, a Feb. 6 e-mail indicated key Andersen officials met the previous day to discuss whether to end the auditing firm's lucrative relationship with the Houston energy-trading giant. 
Michael Jones, an Andersen auditor in Houston, e-mailed David Duncan, the lead auditor for the Enron account, a summary of the previous day's "significant discussions" about questionable off-the-balance-sheet transactions at Enron. 
The talks centered on "conflicts of interest" stemming from the millions former Enron chief financial officer Andrew Fastow received by overseeing the special purpose entities involving the transactions, the e-mail showed. 
Andersen officials consider whether to forgo the more than $100 million in fees the company expected to earn from the Enron account, but ultimately decided they could manage the risks of continuing its association with the deals, which ultimately led to Enron's stunning financial collapse last year. 
The new request for Andersen documents came one day after committee investigators met with Duncan, whom Andersen recently fired for destroying documents related to Andersen's Enron account. 
"Our investigators were disappointed by the limited nature of Mr. Duncan's memory," a Democratic committee spokesperson said late Wednesday. "We expect documents and other witnesses to fill in the blanks." 
The committee's Jan. 17 letter to Joseph Berardino, Andersen's managing partner and chief executive, asked for documents related to: 
-the discussion of Fastow's conflicts of interest; 
-the amount Fastow earned from setting up the offshore partnerships involving the transactions (reportedly $30 million); 
-communications between Andersen and Enron's board of directors regarding the board's views of the transactions; 
-information regarding whether Enron's board solicited competing bids when executing the transactions; 
-discussions about "intelligent gambling" related to Enron's mark-to-market earnings; and 
-discussions about concerns that Andersen's $100 million in fees "would be a perceived independence issue," as the Jones e-mail said. 
The committee's new request also sought documents related to discussions Andersen officials had Aug. 21 after Enron Vice President Sherron Watkins contacted the auditors about her concerns regarding the pending financial implosion to occur as a result of the partnership transactions Fastow oversaw. 
The committee previously disclosed Watkins' contacts with Andersen, and released a memo Watkins sent anonymously to Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay earlier in August questioning the propriety of the Fastow-led transactions and warning that Enron would "implode in a wave of accounting scandals."

Andersen falls deeper into Enron crisis.
By David Teather in New York.

Copyright (C) 2002 The Guardian

Arthur Andersen lurched deeper into crisis yesterday after it emerged that the accountancy firm may have been aware of the problems at the collapsed energy firm Enron as much as one year ago. 
It also became apparent that the Enron employee who had warned the company's chief executive Kenneth Lay of an impending crisis in August had made her concerns known to Andersen at the same time. The accountancy firm faces billions of dollars in potential lawsuits from disgruntled investors and there is growing speculation that it may not survive the Enron debacle.
Enron's descent into the biggest bankruptcy in corporate history yesterday led to changes in the way accounting firms are regulated in the US. The securities and exchange commission announced plans for a new independent regulatory body to oversee the accounting profession. 
Chairman of the SEC, Harvey Pitt said the industry was crying out for repair after a decade of neglect. 
Congressional investigators discovered a memo dated February 6 2001 that recounted a meeting between Andersen executives where the question of whether or not to retain Enron as a client was discussed. 
The memo said that Andersen executives had talked about the off balance sheet ventures that were carrying much of Enron's debts and which eventually lead to its collapse. It also detailed a discussion about a potential conflict of interest for Enron's then chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, who controlled one of the ventures. 
Andersen confirmed the contents of the memo but said it was simply a regular annual review and retention meeting. The company also said it had been assured by Enron that an outside firm of lawyers was examining the claims of the whistleblower in August.

Enron, auditor Andersen trying to pin responsibility for collapse

01/18/2002
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

WASHINGTON (AP) - Enron Corp. and its auditor, Arthur Andersen, are trying to pin responsibility on each other for allowing questionable financial practices to continue and push Enron toward bankruptcy. Enron abruptly fired Andersen, citing its destruction of thousands of documents and its accounting advice. 
Sniping back, Andersen said Thursday its relationship with Enron ended in early December when the company slid into the biggest corporate bankruptcy in U.S. history. Thousands of employees lost their jobs and many had their retirement accounts - predominantly in Enron stock - essentially wiped out.
Andersen's chief executive, Joseph Berardino, said the accounting firm's officials dutifully informed Enron's general counsel after learning of the concerns of an Enron executive in August. Enron told the Andersen officials that it had engaged a law firm to investigate, Berardino noted.

Lawmakers investigating Enron have accepted more than $700,000 in political donations from company 
WASHINGTON (AP) - More than $700,000 in campaign donations has gone from Enron Corp. to the members of seven congressional committees investigating its collapse, but none of the lawmakers has decided to drop out of the probe. 
That doesn't surprise government watchdogs. 
Instead, senators and representatives are getting rid of Enron's money. 
Among the 118 congressional investigators on the committees, Texas' two Republican senators, Phil Gramm and Kay Bailey Hutchison, are the two biggest beneficiaries of the Houston-based energy company's contributions. 
Hutchison, who sits on the Senate Commerce Committee, accepted $99,500 from Enron from 1989 through 2001. She said Thursday she would donate $100,000 to a charitable organization for laid-off workers at Enron, which declared bankruptcy Dec. 2. She also said she would stay involved in investigating Enron.

Enron Scandal: Bank Fallout
CIBC would like to forget nightmare: Total writeoff likely: Enron's 'project Braveheart' seemed too good to be true

WASHINGTON - For CIBC World Markets, the deal in mid-2000 seemed too good to be true. 
Here was an opportunity from the world's largest energy trader and the United States' top video renter to get in on the ground floor of the hot communications broadband market to distribute films to consumers by telephone.
For an investment of just US$115.2-million, CIBC would receive almost all the earnings from Enron Corp.'s share of "Project Braveheart," named after the 1995 Mel Gibson movie. 
But Blockbuster did not know about the Braveheart side deal, and the Blockbuster-Enron deal eventually fell apart. Fewer than 1,000 people received the cutting-edge service -- and none of them paid. Yet Enron still managed to book profits of almost US$111-million from Braveheart during the final three months of 2000 and early into 2001, virtually offsetting the losses in its fledgling fibre-optics division, according to a detailed account in The Wall Street Journal. 
For its part, CIBC is reluctant to talk in detail about the Project Braveheart investment that will likely end up as a total write-off -- and a nightmare the Toronto bank wants to forget. 
"CIBC's exposure as a result of the Braveheart transaction is contained in the numbers we announced in November," said Rob McLeod, CIBC's spokesman in Toronto, referring to the bank's disclosure late last year that it had US$115-million in senior unsecured loans, letters of credit, derivatives and secured exposures of approximately US$100-million tied up in Enron. 
"We stand by our November announcement concerning our exposure to Enron," Mr. McLeod added yesterday. 
It appears that CIBC is just as much a victim as are Enron's other investors and employees in what is turning out to be a hocus-pocus world of off-the-books investments and debt parking -- all designed to prop up Enron's financial image at a time when it was spiralling into the history books as corporate America's largest failure. 
Six Congressional committees, the U.S. Justice Department and the Securities & Exchange Commission have launched probes into the collapse of the now-bankrupt Houston-based energy trader, and the roles played by its senior executives and key auditors, Arthur Andersen LLP. The Enron board voted yesterday to fire Andersen as the company's auditors, effective immediately. 
The investigations are not yet formally underway, but the unravelling of Enron has moved at breakneck speed, most dramatically this week with the revelation that the Chicago head office of Andersen was fully aware as far back as February, 2001, that there were serious problems with Enron's accounting practices. 
A memo, dated Feb.6, referred to a meeting of Andersen executives who talked about the amount of debt Enron had kept off its books and whether Enron should be dropped as a client. Ultimately, Andersen stayed on to perform both auditing and other services, which generated about US$53-million in fees in 2001. 
The memo also appears to support secret testimony by David Duncan, the Enron auditor who was fired Tuesday for ordering the shredding and destruction of thousands of Enron-related documents and e-mails after it became known the SEC had launched an investigation in late October. 
Enron filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Dec. 2 and two of its key assets -- its energy-trading division and its natural gas pipeline -- are being sold off. 
On Wednesday, before the Congressional energy and commerce committee, Mr. Duncan insisted he was only doing his job and had received approval from the Chicago office to destroy the documents. Congressional investigators also heard that Sherron Watkins, an Enron executive, had raised concerns about accounting problems with unusual partnerships that Andersen signed off on in February. 
The SEC moved yesterday to tighten U.S. accounting rules through a new regulatory body to oversee the industry. Complaining there were "too many accounting failures," Harvey Pitt, the SEC chairman, said the new private-sector panel will be able investigate accountants. 
"There is a need for reform of the regulation of our accounting profession," Mr. Pitt said. "We cannot afford a system like the present one that facilitates failure rather than success."

Enron Reports Weren't Reviewed Fully by SEC for Several Years Before Collapse

01/18/2002
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

WASHINGTON -- The Securities and Exchange Commission didn't do a thorough review Enron Corp.'s annual reports for at least three years prior to the energy trading company's collapse, people with knowledge of the process told The Wall Street Journal. 
Twice in the 1990s, the regulator gave Enron waivers from two regulations that would have triggered extensive financial disclosures about its operations.
The Enron (ENRNQ) scandal has raised numerous questions about the checks and balances in America's financial system. A major issue: How did such a major company get away with making indecipherable disclosures about its far-flung trading operations and complicated corporate structure, which Wall Street analysts and some Enron executives confessed they couldn't understand? 
One answer that is starting to emerge from people familiar with the regulatory system is that the SEC failed to conduct a thorough review of the company's financial statements, even though the agency is responsible for reviewing investor disclosure documents to make sure companies clearly explain their operations, financial condition and risks. Rep. John Dingell of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, recently asked the SEC in a letter how it failed "to require adequate disclosures over the years." 
An SEC spokesman declined Thursday to comment on the details of how the agency handled Enron over the past decade. An Enron spokesman also declined to comment. 
Enron's problems escaped earlier detection in part because the SEC wasn't looking. Staff in the SEC's division of corporation finance, which reviews annual reports and company applications to sell stock, most recently studied Enron's annual reports for 1996 and 1997. Internal records show the SEC had looked at those Enron statements because there is a record of two comment letters with questions for Enron about the reports in September 1997 and September 1998, although the specific details of the inquiries aren't clear.

Enron Scandal: Legal Battles
Andersen, Enron hire legal heavyweights: Who's who of law world

WASHINGTON - Enron Corp., Arthur Andersen LLP and several of their present and former executives have hired lawyers who represented a U.S. president, headed federal prosecutors' offices and enforced the law for the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
The roster includes Robert S. Bennett, who represented Bill Clinton, the former president, in the Paula Jones sex scandal; former U.S. Attorney Carl S. Rauh; Watergate prosecutor Earl Silbert; William R. McLucas, the former chief of the SEC enforcement division; and the firm headed by David Boies, who took on Microsoft Corp. for the federal government.
The cost of such defence is high, as is the risk to the potential defendants. The lawyers work at firms whose partners earn an average of US$500,000 to US$1.7-million a year, according to a 2001 survey by American Lawyer. 
Their top priority will be heading off criminal prosecution for their clients. "The first thing you do is beat jail," said Stanley S. Arkin, a white-collar defence lawyer with New York's Chadbourne & Parke, who said he has been approached by some involved in the Enron case. Other priorities: salvaging the client's business, reputation and money, he said. 
Enron is under investigation by the Justice Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission and congressional committees. 
Andersen and its officials face an SEC investigation and allegations it failed to report irregularities by Enron and destroyed documents. 
The Enron board chose Mr. Bennett, a former counsel to the Senate Ethics Committee, to deal with any government investigations, including those by Congress. A key task for him will be telling Enron's story to the media, a role he played for Mr. Clinton during the Paula Jones brouhaha. 
Mr. Bennett, a white-collar crime specialist, is being assisted by Mr. Rauh, a former U.S. attorney in Washington, and a partner at Mr. Bennett's 1,700-lawyer firm. 
The task of handling Enron's bankruptcy went to New York's Weil, Gotshal & Manges, a 900-lawyer firm that had advised Enron on its planned merger with Dynegy Corp. After Dynegy pulled out of that deal in November, Enron's board hired the firm's restructuring team to consider all options, including bankruptcy. 
Andersen, the fifth-largest U.S. accounting firm, hired Davis Polk & Wardwell, a 600-lawyer New York firm to handle "matters pertaining to Enron," said spokesman Kevin Cavanaugh. 
Daniel F. Kolb and Michael P. Carroll are lead lawyers for Andersen. Mr. Kolb is a securities litigator. Mr. Carroll, a securities specialist, has also represented the accounting firm KPMG LLP. 
Andersen's chief Enron auditor, David Duncan, who was fired Jan. 15 for ordering destruction of thousands of e-mails and documents at a time the SEC was asking for them, hired Sullivan & Cromwell, a 650-lawyer New York firm. 
That team includes Gandolfo DiBlasi, who has represented Anderson partners in SEC matters, and Robert J. Giuffra Jr., former chief counsel of the U.S. Senate Banking Committee and of a special Senate committee that investigated the Whitewater scandal. 
Joseph Berardino, Andersen's chief executive, has not hired a lawyer to deal with any Enron issues, said spokesman Patrick Dorton. 
Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive, hired Earl Silbert, the first Watergate prosecutor, who represents Mr. Lay in all civil, criminal, SEC and Congressional matters. 
Andrew Fastow, Enron's former chief financial officer, hired David Boies's 119-lawyer firm, Boies Schiller & Flexner of Armonk of New York. Richard Drubel will be involved day to day. He and Mr. Boies brought a class-action against Sotheby's Holdings Inc. and rival Christie's International PLC charging price fixing of commissions. 
Mr. Fastow, who made US$30-million from partnerships that dealt with Enron, according to former Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling, has hired Houston's David Gerger, who has represented other executives in criminal matters. 
Mr. Skilling, who made US$30-million from sales of his Enron stock last year, hired O'Melveny & Myers, a Los Angeles-based firm of about 700 lawyers. Partner Bruce Hiler is a former associate director of enforcement at the SEC.

Canadian institutional investors file suit against Enron's Wall Street bankers: 'Wrongful conduct' claim
Colleen DeBaise
Dow Jones

National Post

(c) National Post 2002. All Rights Reserved.

NEW YORK - Toronto-based Silvercreek Management Inc. and several other Canadian institutional investors have filed a lawsuit in Manhattan federal court blaming Enron Corp.'s Wall Street investment bankers for the losses they have incurred. 
The suit claims that "the wrongful conduct which underlies this case is founded on Wall Street and in Manhattan, where Enron's investment bankers sold the securities which propped up the pyramid."
The Canadian institutional investors say they poured more than US$175-million into Enron debt securities during October 2001. 
The investors claim Enron's bankers earned heavy underwriting fees and continued to tout Enron's debt even as the company collapsed. The banks "knew or should have known" that Enron was engaged in extensive "off-book" transactions to conceal debts, and defrauded investors by marketing the securities, according to the suit. 
Legal experts predict more litigation to follow that seeks relief from Enron bankers such as Citigroup Inc.'s Salomon Smith Barney unit, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Banc of America Securities. 
The banks are "perceived as deep pockets with insurance coverage," said Richard Tilton, a bankruptcy specialist in private practice in New York. In a case such as Enron's, where a bankruptcy judge has suspended investor litigation against the company itself, "it's very common to sue parties involved in the transactions," such as bankers who underwrite securities offerings, he noted. 
Salomon, Goldman and Banc of America, a unit of Bank of America Corp., declined to comment. The suit also blames auditor Arthur Andersen for contributing to the mess. Andersen didn't return a call seeking comment. 
Pat Villareal, a securities litigation partner in the Dallas office of Jones Day, said the suit against Enron's investment bankers "in all likelihood might be an attempt to bring an action that's outside the confines of the bankruptcy proceedings." 
The investment banks could argue that the suit belongs in bankruptcy court because the allegations are tied "inextricably to Enron and its officers," she said. If that happens, the suit -- like others against Enron -- would be put on indefinite hold, part of an automatic bankruptcy order that suspends litigation to allow a company's executives to focus on restructuring. 
Even if the suit is allowed to proceed in federal court, it remains to be seen whether investors could hold Enron's bankers responsible. 
If the banks argue that they were misled by Enron's financial statements as they prepared prospectuses, they might have to admit some failure in their own due diligence reviews, Mr. Tilton said. 
"It would be embarrassing for the investment banks to say they were led down the road and had no idea what was going on," he said. "Claiming ignorance is not a particular helpful defence if you're before a jury and particularly if you're in federal court on securities laws."

Enron probe is yet to begin.

Copyright (C) 2002 The Times of India

MUMBAI: Six months after the announcement of a judicial inquiry into the Enron issue (July 11 2001) and three months after a retired supreme court judge, Sudhakar Karddukar, was appointed to head the Commission (October 25, 2001), the probe is still not begun. 
Mantralaya officials told TNN the government had not yet finished providing the infrastructure for the commission. Financial provisions were still being finalised and the necessary staff of 10 persons being provided. A decision has been taken to provide an office at Arun Chambers at Tardeo.
Energy secretary R. B. Buddhiraja told TNN the Commission was likely to begin work next week. Replying to a question of whether an inquiry into the project would be of any effective use after the power major Enron Corp, had collapsed in Houston and the Dabhol Power Company was up for grabs, he said it was not for the ministry to decide. The commission would have to decide its own role. 
The inquiry has been given six months to probe the two phases of the Dabhol project, the power purchase agreement and its history, and the possible political fallout. If the Commission does get under way it is likely to take much longer than six months, depending on the response to the public notice and subsequent developments.

Imagine for a moment the quandary that faced Sherron Watkins, Enron Corp.'s would-be whistle blower. 
Worried that company losses were being hidden in murky partnerships, the feisty Enron vice-president of business development took her concerns straight to the top last August.
"I am incredibly nervous that we will implode in a wave of accounting scandals," she wrote to Enron chief executive officer Kenneth Lay. 
Enron's Houston law firm, Vinson & Elkins, reviewed her complaints and dutifully determined that the accounting gymnastics were "creative and aggressive" bookkeeping, but not inappropriate. 
The matter was dropped, and Ms. Watkins's warning is now eerily prophetic. We now know that the belated disclosure of hundreds of millions of dollars in debts to those partnerships helped sink Enron. 
But what if Ms. Watkins had pursued her complaint further -- to Enron's auditors, to its board of directors, to regulators, to the police, to Congress or even the President of the United States? Where would she have found a sympathetic ear? 
Given Enron's vast web of political connections, greased by millions of dollars in political contributions, validation would have been uncommonly hard to find. 
Follow the money trail from Enron's Houston home to Chicago, New York and Washington, and the portrait emerges of an entire system awash in apparent conflicts of interest. 
For starters, the lawyers at Vinson & Elkins could hardly be expected to be unbiased. 
Enron was its biggest client. And its lawyers helped craft the suspect partnership deals of which Ms. Watkins complained. 
Enron's auditor, Chicago-based Arthur Andersen LLP was also working both sides of the fence. It collected hefty fees for auditing the energy company, providing business advice and doing the books for one of the partnerships. 
With nowhere in Houston to turn, Ms. Watkins might have looked to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which regulates Enron and the auditing profession. But SEC chairman Harvey Pitt, a securities lawyer, worked for Andersen before joining the SEC. 
In Texas, the state Attorney-General and a judge handling shareholder lawsuits have already stepped aside because of conflicts of interest because they received Enron political funds. 
Going to the feds would also have been problematic. U.S. Attorney-General John Ashcroft -- the country's top cop -- took $58,000 (U.S.) worth of Enron cash during his failed 2000 U.S. Senate run. He and his entire Houston-based staff of attorneys have since stepped down from a criminal probe of Enron. 
The maze of Enron links inside the Bush White House is mind-boggling. The Bush team took $424,000 from Enron and its executives in 1999-2000. 
So close were President George W. Bush and Vice-President Dick Cheney -- both former Texas oilmen -- to Mr. Lay that they called him "Kenny Boy." The Enron boss was also instrumental in helping to craft the Bush energy policy. Economic adviser Larry Lindsey earned $50,000 from Enron last year for serving on a special company board. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick served on Enron's advisory council. Mr. Bush's top political strategist Karl Rove owned so much Enron stock that he had to sell it after joining the White House to avoid running afoul of federal ethics rules. Marc Racicot, the chairman of the Republican National Committee and Mr. Bush's lead negotiator in the Canada-U.S. lumber fight, worked as an Enron lobbyist. The Secretary of the Army is a former Enron executive. 
And on it goes. White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales is a former partner at Vinson & Elkins, Enron's law firm. The law firm was also one of Mr. Bush's biggest political patrons, ponying up more than $200,000 for Mr. Bush's 2000 presidential run. 
On Capitol Hill, where no less than 10 committees are now picking through the Enron carcass, an objective eye is equally hard to find. 
The pockets of seven out of 10 sitting senators and nearly half of the 435 House members are lined with Enron cash. 
Like Enron, Arthur Andersen was also a big Bush donor, giving $146,000 to his 2000 presidential run. The head of Andersen's Houston office, who this week was demoted for his involvement in shredding Enron papers, raised more than $100,000 for Mr. Bush. 
No, Ms. Watkins had nowhere to turn. 
But this isn't just her problem anymore. The Enron saga cries out for an independent arbiter to dig through the slime. Its investors, employees and creditors deserve an objective accounting. 
Sadly, this administration and this Congress are in no position to deliver it. bmckenna@globeandmail.ca

Politicians Trade Shots Over Enron
By SCOTT LINDLAW

Copyright 2002 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

WASHINGTON (AP) - A Democratic congressional leader said he documented 17 provisions in Vice President Dick Cheney's energy plan that benefited Enron, and demanded anew that the White House list contacts with the bankrupt energy trading company. 
The administration again refused on Thursday, calling the request by Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., "a partisan waste of taxpayer money."
Waxman, the top Democrat on the House Government Reform Committee, has been asking Cheney since April to turn over records on whom he met with as he developed the national energy strategy. Cheney has refused, though the White House acknowledged that Enron representatives met six times with Cheney or his aides on energy issues last year. Enron has been the largest single donor to President Bush. 
Waxman said that because he was stonewalled, he did his own analysis of what Enron sought and what Enron got in the energy plan. 
"The analysis reveals that numerous policies in the White House energy plan are virtually identical to the positions Enron advocated," Waxman wrote Cheney in a letter dated Wednesday. 
Among the examples: energy deregulation initiatives, support for trading in energy derivatives, proposals to facilitate natural gas projects, the granting of eminent domain so power lines could be built more quickly and spur development in India. 
"This creates the unfortunate appearance that a large contributor received special access and obtained extraordinarily favorable results in the White House energy plan," Waxman wrote. 
Waxman's findings came as the administration was under intense scrutiny for its contacts with Enron in the weeks before it went bankrupt. 
White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said the energy plan contains only proposals that Bush and Cheney believed would help make the nation more energy-independent. 
"The allegation by Congressman Waxman that anything was put in that plan for political purposes is, of itself, a partisan waste of taxpayer money," Fleischer said. 
Fleischer promised that "the administration will continue to be forthcoming in answering questions and providing information." 
But he again declined to provide specific lists of contacts between the administration and Enron during energy task force meetings. 
"There is a very important principle involved here, and that is the right of the government and all future presidencies whether they are Democrat or Republican, to conduct reviews, to receive information from constituents, regardless of their party or their background, in a thoughtful and deliberative fashion," he said. 
Asked whether releasing lists of contacts would reassure the public that nothing improper took place behind closed doors, Fleischer said: "You're asking for us to prove a negative, and that's a road we're not traveling."

GOP: Enron won't hurt in 2002 campaigns

AUSTIN, Texas (AP) - Republicans say the collapse of Enron Corp. and resulting federal investigations of the energy trading company that has been President Bush's largest single donor shouldn't hurt the party in the 2002 elections. 
"Enron is an issue that is not a political issue," Republican National Committee Deputy Chairman Jack Oliver said Thursday at the party's winter meetings in President Bush's home state.
"Enron is a situation where people have been badly hurt, people have lost their jobs and their life savings," Oliver said. "The president and many members of Congress are moving forward, not to make it partisan, but to try to get to the bottom of it to make sure it doesn't happen again." 
The company donated heavily to both parties, and Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay has been Bush's biggest campaign benefactor. 
Asked if fallout from Enron's collapse into bankruptcy and the company's ties to the administration will lead to a new congressional push for campaign finance reform, Oliver said, "We'll have to wait and see."

Report: Former Enron executive resigns from PUC 
DALLAS (AP) - The state's top utility regulator, a former Enron Corp. executive whose boss donated money to Gov. Rick Perry following the appointment, has quit amid congressional investigations over the company's financial meltdown, according to The Dallas Morning News' Friday editions. 
Mario Max Yzaguirre, formerly president of Houston-based Enron's operations in Mexico, told the Republican governor Thursday he was resigning after weeks of turmoil over his selection. 
Sources familiar with the decision told the newspaper on condition of anonymity that Yzaguirre's appointment as Public Utility Commission chairman had become a political liability and would continue to be raised by opponents trying to damage Perry's election effort. 
Yzaguirre, who was appointed chairman by Perry in June, did not return a telephone call early Friday from The Associated Press. 
A spokeswoman for Perry, who is running this year for a full term as governor, declined Thursday to discuss Yzaguirre's situation. 

Lawmakers investigating Enron have accepted more than $700,000 in political donations from company

WASHINGTON (AP) - More than $700,000 in campaign donations has gone from Enron Corp. to the members of seven congressional committees investigating its collapse, but none of the lawmakers has decided to drop out of the probe. 
That doesn't surprise government watchdogs.
"If every member of Congress had to recuse themselves from any legislation or any business affecting any one of their donors, Congress would come to a screeching halt," said Jeff Cronin, spokesman for Common Cause. 
Utah's two Republican senators were listed among the recipients, with Bob Bennett receiving $8,053 and Orrin Hatch getting $3,000. Bennett is on the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee and the Senate Banking Committee. Hatch is on the Senate Finance Committee. 
Some senators and representatives are getting rid of Enron's money. 
Among the 118 congressional investigators on the committees, Texas' two Republican senators, Phil Gramm and Kay Bailey Hutchison, are the two biggest beneficiaries of the Houston-based energy company's contributions. 
Hutchison, who sits on the Senate Commerce Committee, accepted $99,500 from Enron from 1989 through 2001. She said Thursday she would donate $100,000 to a charitable organization for laid-off workers at Enron, which declared bankruptcy Dec. 2. She also said she would stay involved in investigating Enron. 
"I am deeply concerned about the situation in which Enron employees and retirees have found themselves, especially regarding their pensions and other benefits," she said. "These are my constituents and they have borne the brunt of the problem at Enron." 
Gramm, the former chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, received $97,350. He is the senior GOP member on the panel and also sits on the Senate Finance Committee. Both committees have begun Enron investigations. 
Gramm's wife, Wendy, is on Enron's board and audit committee and has been named in a lawsuit by investors against Enron executives and directors. 
"He has not seen the scope of the proposed hearings and has yet to make a decision" on taking part, Gramm spokesman Larry Neal said. 
The Texas senator, who is retiring in January, has begun returning his 2002 campaign donations, and that probably includes Enron donations, Neal said. 
Enron donated to 71 senators and 188 representatives - nearly half of Congress - according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The 118 Senate and House members on the seven committees accepted $722,749 from the company or its officials, according to an Associated Press analysis of the center's data. Since the analysis was done, three more committees have begun investigations. 
Larry Noble, executive director of the center, said the lawmakers were in a less vulnerable position than Attorney General John Ashcroft, who removed himself from the Justice Department's investigation because he received more than $57,000 in Enron donations for his unsuccessful 2000 Senate re-election campaign. 
"The attorney general is prosecuting Enron," Noble said. "These committees are not adjudicating anything or prosecuting anything per se." 
Some lawmakers are moving to distance themselves from Enron by returning the donations or giving like amounts to charity. 
Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., a member of the Commerce Committee who received $2,705, will donate an equivalent amount to Habitat for Humanity of Kansas City. "He just wants to avoid any question in any possible hearings he'll be involved in," spokesman Erik Hotmire said. 
Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., received $2,000. "I don't feel at all compromised," said the senator, who is leading the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee's Enron investigation. 
Lieberman's former chief of staff, Michael Lewan, lobbied for Enron earlier this year, holding three meetings with the senator's staff but not with Lieberman. Lewan remains a political adviser to the senator, but Lieberman spokesman Dan Gerstein said that would have no impact on the investigation. 
Rep. Billy Tauzin, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, accepted $6,464 in contributions from Enron. The Louisiana Republican doesn't plan on giving it back because campaign contributions don't affect his decisions, a spokesman said. 
"It doesn't matter if they gave us a million dollars," Tauzin spokesman Ken Johnson said. "We're not going to cut them any slack. ... All I can tell you is both Enron and (its accounting firm) Arthur Andersen are in line for a good old-fashioned spanking." 
Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, the chair of the Energy and Commerce energy and air quality subcommittee, got at least $28,909 in Enron donations, but his spokeswoman, Samantha Jordan, says he won't drop out of the investigation. 
Barton has pushed for electricity deregulation, an important issue to Enron. 
"It is not unusual for a Texas congressman to take contributions from a Texas company like Enron, and he did not make any decisions based on any funding," Jordan said. "He will participate." 
Barton is considering making a contribution to a fund for Enron employees.

SEC's Pitt Stresses He's Not Participating In Enron Case
By Judith Burns

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
(This report was first published late Thursday.) 

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey Pitt expressed confidence Thursday in the White House's nominees to the SEC and said the agency won't be hobbled by its diminished ranks.
The five-member SEC has been reduced to two, Pitt and commissioner Laura Unger, a Republican who has announced plans to step down shortly. 
Bush recently announced plans to name two Republicans to fill vacancies on the SEC. Both work for Big Five accounting firms, raising questions about potential conflicts of interest as the SEC tackles hot-button issues such as its investigation of possible accounting fraud at Enron Corp. (ENRNQ). 
The Senate has yet to consider Bush's nominees: attorney Paul Atkins, a partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers LLC, and economist Cynthia Glassman, an economist and principal at Ernst & Young LLP. 
At a press conference Thursday to announce proposals to toughen oversight of U.S. accounting, Pitt said both Atkins and Glassman have "excellent background, skills and ability," and downplayed any potential conflicts their accounting firm background might pose. 
Asked about his own potential conflicts in the Enron matter, Pitt reiterated that he has not participated in any votes on it since casting one in October to commence an investigation. Some congressional Democrats have urged Pitt to recuse himself from any Enron-related matters that come before the SEC, given that he was a securities lawyer who represented Big Five accounting firms, including Arthur Andersen LLP, Enron's auditor. 
"I am not participating in the Enron investigation," Pitt stressed. He said the agency's probe is being handled by its enforcement division and said any future action he might take - or recuse himself from - is hypothetical. 
If further action is required, Pitt promised to adhere to the letter and spirit of ethical guidelines governing the SEC. 
"There is no way I would ever do anything to compromise the integrity of this agency's actions," Pitt vowed. 
Pitt declined to comment on the SEC's ongoing investigation into Enron's collapse. It was recently widened to include destruction of Enron-related documents by employees at Arthur Andersen LLP.

SEC's Pitt Faces Criticism on Industry --- U.S. to Form Group To Oversee Reviews Of Accounting Firms
By Michael Schroeder
Staff Reporter

(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

WASHINGTON -- As part of a plan to overhaul accounting oversight, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission proposed a new industry organization that will oversee disciplinary reviews of accountants. 
The plan is a result of discussions over the past few months that SEC officials have had with representatives of the Big Five accounting firms and the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt plans a series of accounting-industry reforms, including new forms of oversight and new rules for expanded corporate disclosures.
"There is a need for reform of the regulation of our accounting profession," he said during a news conference, adding, "We cannot afford a system like the present one that facilitates failure rather than success." 
Among other things, the SEC's plan includes a proposal to form a private-sector panel that likely will replace the current disciplinary oversight functions provided by both the Public Oversight Board and the AICPA. The organization, which Mr. Pitt said would be subject to SEC oversight, would have full regulatory power to investigate wrongdoing by accountants and to issue penalties ranging from censures to bans from the industry. 
The panel is expected to be funded by fees from corporate audit clients. To assure objectivity, it will have a majority of public members who are independent from the accounting industry. The SEC will seek industry and public comment. 
Whether this goes far enough to address the accounting industry's problems no doubt will be a matter of intense debate. John Coffee, a professor of law at Columbia University, says lawmakers should be involved in addressing the accounting industry's problems. 
The issue, he notes, "is whether the chairman can negotiate with the industry a new self-regulatory structure and not involve Congress. . . . Any new self-regulatory structure can't be done over the weekend, in a closet or in a hotel room." 
The accounting industry has long fought changes that would put teeth into the oversight efforts of the self-regulatory bodies. The industry has been notorious for failing to discipline its members, fearing that the process would increase private liability in private class-action lawsuits. 
"Before Enron ever happened, I urged that the industry come up with something," said Mr. Pitt, adding, "I told them elements that had to be in the plan," including a new discipline approach. There will be no proposal implemented unless they meet our standards and conditions before they are fully implemented." 
The proposal is part of an effort to restore waning confidence in accounting work following Enron Corp.'s collapse as well as several accounting scandals and earnings restatements at other big corporations. Indeed, in an unprecedented statement early last month, the Big Five accounting firms -- Arthur Andersen LLP, KPMG LLP, Deloitte & Touche LLP, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and Ernst & Young LLP -- promised to abide by higher standards in the future. 
"The potential loss of confidence in our accounting firms is a burden our capital markets cannot and should not bear," warned Mr. Pitt. 
The industry is divided in its support for the new panel, said people in the industry. In addition, accounting officials question whether the proposal will be enough to satisfy criticism of the profession in Congress and among consumer groups. 
Pointing to the "peer review" system in the accounting industry, critics say self-regulation has been ineffective. This system, in which one accounting firm monitors how another firm conducts audits, has never resulted in a negative review of a large accounting firm since it was adopted in 1977 -- even though there have been accounting scandals in that period. 
Before joining the SEC, Mr. Pitt was a top securities lawyer who had represented each of the Big Five and the AICPA. Statements he has made about a "kinder, gentler" SEC have raised concerns that he wouldn't be a tough regulator. 
In response, the SEC chairman has recently pressed an agenda to improve disclosure and create better industry oversight aimed at avoiding future Enrons. 
He has pushed hard to get the accounting firms and the AICPA to support his ideas. 
Mr. Pitt's ideas mirror recommendations the Big Five requested that the SEC adopt in a recent letter. The firms urged the SEC to issue an interpretative release "as soon as possible" to improve 2001 annual reports by beefing up disclosure in the management discussion and analysis section of filings. 
As a short-term fix, the Big Five firms asked the SEC to provide "immediate guidance" to public companies on disclosing off-balance-sheet transactions, over-the-counter derivatives contracts, and related-party transactions -- three hot-button areas in Enron's debacle. 
The SEC could approve such guidance in a matter of weeks -- which carries the weight of new SEC policy with public companies. Mr. Pitt has intentions of larger-scale changes for requiring material events to be disclosed as they unfold, rather than in quarterly statements that investors read long after events occur. Those changes would require new rules, a process that normally takes at least several months.

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE OVERVIEW
S.E.C. LEADER SEES OUTSIDE MONITORS FOR AUDITING FIRMS
By STEPHEN LABATON

01/18/2002
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 6
c. 2002 New York Times Company

WASHINGTON, Jan. 17 -- Responding to growing criticism of accounting practices stemming from the collapse of the Enron Corporation, the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission proposed today that the accounting industry should be policed by a group dominated by outside experts instead of policing itself. 
In Connecticut, the state attorney general asked the state's accountancy board today to consider whether to revoke the licenses that let Arthur Andersen, Enron's auditor, work for corporations in that state.
Enron itself formally announced that it was firing Andersen as its auditor, a step that Andersen executives said they had expected. Enron is also preparing to sue Andersen, a person close to Enron said. 
Internal Andersen documents made public today showed that as long ago as February, Andersen executives considered dropping Enron as a client because of concerns that it was keeping debts off its main balance sheets. 
The documents also indicated that Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive, disposed of stock within days of receiving a letter in August warning him of accounting problems. [Page C1.] 
Most of the pressure today focused on Andersen. Disclosures that the firm stood by its audits long after learning of Enron's possible misdeeds, and that it had destroyed Enron documents, have provoked devastated investors to demand that the authorities rein accountants in. 
In outlining his proposal today, Harvey L. Pitt, the S.E.C. chairman, said that antiquated rules on corporate disclosure and accounting ethics had allowed investors to suffer from a number of auditing lapses over the last decade. These rules, he said, must be revised. 
''We simply cannot afford a system like the present one that facilitates failure rather than success,'' he said at a news conference this afternoon in Washington. ''This commission cannot, and in any event, it will not, tolerate this pattern of growing restatements, audit failures, corporate failures and then massive investor losses. Somehow, we have got to put a stop to a vicious cycle that has now been in evidence for far too many years.'' 
But his plan, still preliminary and months from adoption, was sharply criticized by some experts. They urged him to consider proposals by a predecessor to assure that auditors remain independent from their clients. Mr. Pitt, they said, missed the point that accounting firms that earn more from consulting than auditing, as Andersen did for Enron, face inevitable conflicts of interest. 
''He's chasing a gopher down a wrong hole,'' said James D. Cox, a professor of securities and corporate law at Duke University and author of an accounting textbook. ''This is not a situation which involved somebody at Arthur Andersen who had previously engaged in misconduct. This is a question of ongoing problems in an accounting profession which has close ties to clients, ties which seriously compromise their independence.'' 
At his news conference, Mr. Pitt said that changes in the oversight rules and disclosure requirements were essential, but he dismissed suggestions that he take steps to keep auditors from performing other work for the same clients. 
''Auditor independence is not the cause of the problems that we are witnessing,'' Mr. Pitt said. ''This system has enough flaws and enough difficulties in it that cry out for repair. And it would be easy for some people to convince you that the entire problem is a question of auditor indepedence and ignore the much bigger issues of the quality of our disclosures, the penetrability or impenetrability of financial reports, and how audits are structured and performed.'' 
He also deflected suggestions that the federal government play a greater role in overseeing the industry and that the S.E.C. be given more lawyers and officials to prosecute white-collar corruption. He does not, he said, ''believe that the solution to every problem, even major problems, is throwing the taxpayers' money and more bodies from the government at the issue.'' 
Though Mr. Pitt said that no new law was needed to enact his own proposal, to shift the responsibilities for discipline from an industry group, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, to a new organization, Professor Cox said that the commission might not otherwise have the necessary authority. 
Professional accountants now face several levels of oversight. The institute disciplines them for ethics and rules violations. The Securities and Exchange Commission traditionally files complaints for more egregious violations, federal violations in particular. State boards can discipline them or strip them of their licenses for violations of state rules and laws. 
Mr. Pitt said today that his plan would take the accounting institute out of the business of conducting disciplinary and quality review proceedings. 
The plan would probably also remove the Public Oversight Board, a group of outside experts, from performing such roles as overseeing peer reviews of accountants' work. 
His proposal was generally supported by the institute, which was a client of Mr. Pitt's before he became chairman. Barry Melancon, president and chief executive of the institute, called it unprecedented but constructive and important to restoring confidence in auditors. 
But Charles A. Bowsher, the former comptroller general of the United States, who now heads the Public Oversight Board, criticized the plan as a quick fix that glossed over the bigger issues. 
''I don't think it will be an effective self-regulatory process,'' Mr. Bowsher said. ''I'm a great believer of the self-regulatory process. But in our case what this will probably do is replace a board of true outsiders with one consisting of industry insiders and outsiders. This is an effort by the A.I.C.P.A. to gain control of the self-regulatory process.'' 
Mr. Pitt's proposal still faces many months of review. After specific rules have been written, they will be subject to the normal process of comment and revision. In addition, the S.E.C., with five seats, is hobbled by three vacancies. 
The move by the Connecticut attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, presents another setback for Arthur Andersen. 
Mr. Blumenthal's request for the state's accounting board to consider revoking the firm's licenses in Connecticut could prompt other states to follow. Companies that have become the subjects of such investigations by several states, like the E. F. Hutton and Drexel Burnham Lambert securities firms, were ultimately forced into liquidation. 
Andersen said today that it was committed to uncovering problems at the firm regardless of how many investigations were being conducted. 
''There's a lot of people looking at these issues,'' said Patrick Dorton, an Andersen spokesman. ''We'll leave it to the judgment of the attorney general as to whether there should be one more investigation. We're committed to making the changes necessary to restore public confidence.'' 
In Houston today, a federal judge ordered a hearing next Tuesday on a request to speed the fact-finding behind Andersen's destruction of documents. The request came from Amalgamated Bank, which is owned by labor unions and manages retirement funds with significant holdings of Enron stock. Lawyers for Amalgamated have accused Enron and Andersen of violating federal securities laws, leading to retirement fund losses of more than $10 million.

NATIONAL
SEC PROPOSES ACCOUNTING WATCHDOG IN WAKE OF ENRON
FRANK JAMES AND MELITA MARIE GARZA, CHICAGO TRIBUNE

01/18/2002
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
REGION
A-12
(Copyright 2002)

With Enron Corp.'s meltdown as the backdrop and his own willingness to crack down on the accounting industry questioned, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday proposed creation of a private-sector watchdog group to discipline auditors who fail to produce accurate financial reports. 
Harvey L. Pitt, chairman of the agency that oversees the nation's financial markets and corporate reporting, said regulators, the accounting industry and Congress need to address auditing weaknesses revealed by the Enron debacle and other financial disasters before investor confidence could be restored.
He said he envisioned an independent "tough, no-nonsense" panel with real enforcement powers and the weight of the SEC behind it as a major step in that direction. 
"We simply cannot afford a system like the current one that facilitates failure rather than success," Pitt said. "Accounting firms have important and critical public responsibilities. We've had far too many financial and accounting failures." 
The accounting industry in the past has successfully fought outside efforts to get it to put real teeth into its self-regulatory practices. It also thwarted attempts to increase governmental oversight of the industry. 
But the world has changed in the wake of the scandal engulfing Enron and its auditor, the Chicago-based Andersen accounting firm. 
Questionable off-balance-sheet transactions with a series of outside partnerships hid hundreds of millions of dollars in Enron debt, forcing the company to revise its past earnings reports drastically lower and leading to the company's bankruptcy filing last month. 
Andersen has been bruised by a series of revelations about its handling of Enron's auditing, including the explosive disclosure that the company destroyed thousands of records related to Enron. Andersen said it would fire its senior partner responsible for its Enron audits and has suspended other employees. Late yesterday, the bankrupt Enron fired the entire Andersen firm. 
Pitt himself has come in for criticism as well. His past work as a lawyer for Andersen and other big accounting firms and his pre- scandal public remarks suggesting a gentler SEC approach to accounting issues raised eyebrows among advocates of tough SEC regulation. 
Yesterday, however, Pitt appeared to be warning his former accounting-firm clients that their days of defeating efforts to beef up oversight of their industry were over, thanks to the outrage and loss of faith among investors in the current scandal. 
"This commission cannot, and in any event, it will not tolerate this pattern of growing [financial] restatements, audit failures, corporate failures and then massive investor losses," Pitt said. "Somehow, we have got to put a stop to a vicious cycle that has now been in evidence for far too many years." 
While his proposal lacked many details, Pitt sketched an outline for an independent panel whose members would mainly be unconnected to the accounting industry, though there would be some accounting expertise on the panel. Unlike the Public Oversight Board, another attempt at self-regulation created in 1977 after problems in the accounting industry, Pitt's panel would have the power to conduct investigations, launch disciplinary actions and bar individuals from practicing accounting -- either temporarily or for good -- for incompetence or unethical conduct.

COMPANIES & FINANCE ENRON COLLAPSE - Pitt attacks accountancy system and US audits.

COMPANIES & FINANCE ENRON COLLAPSE - Pitt attacks accountancy system and US audits - ENRON AFTERMATH REGULATOR SEEKS GREATER POWERS - * CONFLICTS OF INTEREST IN SPOTLIGHT - * DUKE BENEFITS FROM RIVAL'S DEMISE - * EUROPEAN GROUPS UNDER THREAT. 
Harvey Pitt, new chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, yesterday castigated the accountancy profession and the US system of financial reporting, calling for a more powerful regulator with the power to ban individuals and firms from auditing public companies.
The scathing speech, delivered in Washington, followed intense criticism of financial disclosure in the Enron debacle and the role of Andersen, the energy trader's auditor. 
Mr Pitt said the "potential loss of confidence in our accounting firms and the audit process is a burden our capital markets cannot and should not bear". 
He acknowledged that leading audit firms had shown a willingness to work with the SEC, the US's chief financial regulator, to produce a better regulatory system. But in a reversal of his previously conciliatory stance, Mr Pitt was highly critical of leading auditors. 
"There is a need for reform of the regulation of our accounting profession. We cannot afford a system, like the present one, that facilitates failure rather than success," he said. 
Mr Pitt signalled a tougher stance even than his predecessor Arthur Levitt, who battled with the profession during his tenure. "We have had far too many financial and accounting failures. The commission cannot, and in any event will not, tolerate this pattern of growing restatements, audit failures, corporate failures and investor losses." 
In light of what he said was a "vicious cycle that has been in evidence for far too many years", Mr Pitt proposed wholesale reforms of accountancy regulations. 
The system of "peer reviews" - where the leading auditors check the quality of each others' audit systems every three years - should end. 
Mr Pitt said peer reviews would be replaced with a more frequent monitoring of audit quality and competence "designed to produce better audits in the future". This would be carried out by a permanent quality control staff, composed of people unaffiliated with any accounting firm. 
These staff would be overseen by a brand new accountancy regulator whose members would be overwhelmingly from outside the profession. 
Mr Pitt said that the SEC would continue to decide whether certain forms of conduct should be pursued as violations of law or treated as violations of ethical and competence standards. 
The new body would oversee the ethical and competence issues and would have the power to perform investigations, bring disciplinary proceedings, publicise its results and restrict individuals and firms from auditing public companies. 
The AICPA, the US accountants' main professional body, responded to the speech by saying the Mr Pitt's proposals were "unprecedented in the more than 100-year history of the accounting profession". 
The AICPA said it would "do all it can to work with the SEC and all interested parties to maintain the integrity of the capital market system". 
A small panel of non-SEC, non-accounting members will look at Mr Pitt's plans during a comment period of between 45 and 60 days.

FERC Chairman: Enron Meltdown Showed Power-Market Strength

01/18/2002

(This article was originally published Thursday.) 

CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp.'s (ENRNQ, ENE) problems appear self-inflicted and aren't linked to larger problems in energy trading markets, Pat Wood, chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, said Thursday.
The lack of serious disruption from Enron's rapid collapse actually highlighted the strengths of the wholesale power markets, suggesting FERC is heading in the right direction with its efforts to create more competitive and open markets, Wood said, addressing an energy conference at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. 
"Moving to competitive energy markets is a good thing and it's the right thing to do," Wood said. "The bad situation at Enron I think largely appears to be a self-inflicted one." 
Wood said he was pleased to see how efficiently the power markets adjusted to operating without Enron. Even before Enron's credit rating slipped below investment grade last year, trading counterparties were unwinding deals with the trading giant. 
Energy markets eliminated Enron in a show of "hateful Darwinism," Wood said. The process "reaffirmed my personal faith that energy markets really worked as we want them to do, which is to reward good guys and punish bad guys," he said. 
That's the message Wood will take before the Senate Energy Committee Jan. 29, when the committee will hold a hearing looking into the market impact of Enron's fiscal collapse. 
Answering questions after his address, Wood said Enron didn't contact him to discuss its problems before they became commonly known. When Enron's troubles became more apparent, FERC worked to make sure the company could continue making physical deliveries of natural gas to help ensure market stability, Wood said.

Burns won't return Enron donations

BOZEMAN (AP) - Sen. Conrad Burns, R-Mont., the Senate's third-largest recipient of campaign donations from Enron Corp., said Thursday he has already spent the money and has no plans to return it to the bankrupt energy trading company. 
"We've already used it, it's already gone," Burns said. "I've got nothing to give back."
Burns, who serves on the Senate's energy, commerce and appropriations committees, received $23,200 in donations from Houston-based Enron, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. 
Burns was third behind two Texas Republicans - Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison ($99,500) and Sen. Phil Gramm ($97,350). 
Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., received $3,250. His office said this week that Baucus plans to donate the money to a nonprofit organization set up to help the workers laid off by Enron. 
Enron was the nation's seventh-largest corporation last fall before going bankrupt as its stock value plummeted from more than $80 a share to less than $1. Top executives sold their stock for hundreds of millions of dollars before investors were informed the company was in trouble, and hundreds of employees saw their retirement savings wiped out. 
Burns said Enron representatives "never asked me for anything personally," made a minimum number of visits to his office and put forward no legislation in Congress. 
If Enron executives defrauded employees or investors, Burns said, that's a felony and should not be tolerated. "If that's the case, they should go to jail." 
Burns said he didn't see a need to pass new laws in the wake of the business failure. 
"How can you pass a law on morality?" he asked. However, he said he might consider some changes in retirement account law.

Elizabeth Dole won't keep campaign money from Enron chairman

01/18/2002
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) - U.S. Senate candidate Elizabeth Dole won't keep $5,000 given to her campaign by Enron Corp. chairman Kenneth Lay and his family as the energy giant neared financial collapse. 
A Dole spokesman said the Republican seeking to succeed U.S. Sen. Jesse Helms raised $20,000 at a fund-raising luncheon hosted by Lay on Sept. 20 in Houston.
Aides said Dole would donate $5,000 to a fund set up to support Enron employees who have lost jobs and retirement savings in the wake of the company's sudden demise. 
At the time of the luncheon, "no one was aware of (Enron's) situation," said Dole spokesman Jay Warshaw. "But under the circumstances, she's not comfortable keeping the direct contributions. It's inappropriate to keep the money at this point." 
The decision comes as political donations from Enron are being scrutinized as investigators piece together what efforts were made to shore up the company through political connections. 
There is no suggestion of Dole of trying to helping executives at Enron. 
Lay hosted the luncheon for about 25 supporters for Dole after she spoke to a women's group in Houston, Warshaw said. The event did not include any other Enron employees, he said. 
Warshaw had told a reporter the day of the fund-raiser, which was not reported in the media at the time, that "campaign activities are still on hold" in the wake of the attacks. 
A North Carolina Democratic Party official questioned Dole's decision not to return the entire $20,000. 
"It's heartless and unseemly to be raking in money at a time when the rest of the country is mourning," said Scott Falmlen, executive director of the state Democratic Party. 
Warshaw said the fund-raiser wasn't a campaign activity. 
"Mrs. Dole was doing no public politicking or stumping," he said. 
Spokesmen for the major Democratic U.S. Senate candidates in North Carolina all said their campaigns had not knowingly accepted any contributions from Enron and would either return or donate any contributions that surfaced.

BusinessWeek Investor: Inside Wall Street
UPPING THE PRESSURE AT NORTHWEST
By Gene G. Marcial

(Copyright 2002 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)

You might expect the stock of Northwest Natural Gas (NWN) not to be rising just now. It is seeking to purchase beleaguered Enron's Portland General Electric, valued at $2.8 billion. True, Northwest, a fast-growing company serving Oregon and parts of Washington, expects to save $30 million a year in efficiencies from the deal. But usually the stock of a buyer comes under pressure. Instead, the stock has risen, from 22 in October to 26.15 on Jan. 9. 
One reason: Northwest is seen by smart-money pros as buyout bait itself. Some industry people think that a potential suitor is Scottish Power, a Glasgow energy group engaged in natural-gas distribution in Britain. These sources say that Scottish has been eyeing both Portland General Electric and Northwest. It may get its hands on Portland, these pros say, by acquiring Northwest--after it has bought Portland.

Report: Enron power plant in China one of several ventures likely to be sold

Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

HONG KONG (AP) - Failed energy giant Enron Corp. may sell its stake in a power plant in southwestern China's Sichuan province, a state-run Chinese newspaper reported Friday. 
If Enron sells out, its Chinese partners hope to find a new foreign partner, the China Daily reported, citing an unidentified Enron representative in Beijing.
Phone calls to Enron's China office and its Asia/Pacific chief in Houston went unanswered Friday. 
Enron has a 51 percent stake in the operator of the power plant, Sichuan Jialing Electric Power Co., a joint venture with state-owned Sichuan Electric Power Corp. 
Enron's bankruptcy has not disrupted the functioning of the power plant, which is profitable, the report said. 
The status of several other Enron projects in China is unclear.

ENRON MAY SELL POWER PLANT.
By ZHANG XIE, China Daily staff.

01/18/2002
China Daily
(Copyright 2002 by China Daily)

Floundering US energy giant Enron Corporation is looking for buyers for its last business on the Chinese mainland in an effort to raise cash to pay its creditors at home. An Enron representative in China said yesterday it was considering selling its stake in a profitable power plant in Southwest China's Sichuan Province, its last operation on the Chinese mainland. A senior Enron executive involved in the power-plant joint venture said: "The pressure to repay debts is fairly heavy and possibly we'll have to sell our stake. "But there is no detailed plan yet. It's just a matter of intention so far." The executive said the business was going well, despite the turmoil at Enron's headquarters. If the decision is made to sell, Enron would likely sell all of its 51 per cent stake in the plant's operator, the Sichuan Jialing Electric Power Company, which has a registered capital of 920 million yuan (US$110 million). The executive said potential buyers will be largely limited to foreign companies as the other investor in the power plant - the State-owned Sichuan Electric Power Corporation - still prefers foreign capital. "Our project is profitable and quite a few foreign companies have expressed their interest," he said, refusing to give further details. An official with the Chinese partner said: "They're preparing to transfer their stake. And the project is going on fairly well." Enron's probable bankruptcy seems not to have disrupted the functioning of the power plant but an official with PetroChina still felt China's largest oil company had had a lucky escape. Earlier, PetroChina had considered a strategic partnership with Enron to build a US$300 million gas pipeline in Northwest China. The PetroChina official said: "Luckily, we didn't complete the deal." Months before it filed the largest bankruptcy in US history on December 2, souring financial conditions had pushed Enron to start retreating from the Chinese market, where it had made substantial progress over the past seven years. Enron Petroleum and Natural Gas (China) Ltd, its major upstream business arm in China, ended all its operations in December. In June, Enron sold an oil and gas exploration business in Sichuan to another US energy firm. While its registrations in China are still valid, Enron closed down its office in Beijing as early as May last year. The return of the oil-trading giant seems a remote possibility, even if it manages to stay afloat. The Enron official in Sichuan said: "Even if the restructuring plan is approved, (the size of) it will surely shrink. And possibly it will never come to China again." Enron, once ranked seventh in the Fortune 500 list of large corporations, slid from Wall Street stardom to bankruptcy court in a matter of weeks, throwing thousands out of work and stirring controversy from Washington to Wall Street.

Enron expressed interest in mills last summer

01/18/2002
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

BERLIN, N.H. (AP) - Collapsed energy giant Enron is reported to have contacted city officials about the future of the mills that have been closed in the bankruptcy of American Tissue Corp. 
The Berlin Daily Sun also reported Friday that Arthur Andersen, Enron's accounting firm that destroyed many Enron documents and was fired Thursday, also worked for American Tissue.
American Tissue dismissed Andersen in October, a month after the company admitted that its financial reports for fiscal 2000 and 2002 contained "material inaccuracies." 
In an Oct. 18 Securities and Exchange Commission filing, American Tissue said Andersen had audited its financial reports for the past two years. 
Edward Stein, American Tissue's executive vice president and chief financial officer, resigned after the inaccuracies were disclosed. 
Berlin officials confirmed discussing with Enron in late summer running the Pulp and Paper of America complex if Berlin and Gorham took the mills by eminent domain for unpaid taxes. 
Enron was one of the world's leading electricity, natural gas, and communications companies. It also provided financing for the pulp, paper and wood products industry and owned Garden State Paper Co. in Garfield, N.J., which produced recycled newsprint. 
The discussions were dropped when American Tissue declared bankruptcy and the fate of the mills fell under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court. 
Enron's bankruptcy and Andersen's involvement has generated scrutiny because of questions about Enron executives making large amounts of money in the sale of more than 17 million shares in the months before it collapsed while employees and investors lost billions. 
The Texas-based company, with close ties to President Bush and other top administration officials, has denied insider trading was involved.

News: Analysis & Commentary: Enron Watch: Investigations
HOT POTATO: HANDLE WITH CARE Playing politics in the Enron probe could burn either party
By Lorraine Woellert and Mike McNamee, with Laura Cohn and Alexandra Starr, in Washington

When Enron Corp. tumbled into bankruptcy, it put thousands out of work and drained billions from investors' portfolios. But the collapse of George W. Bush's top corporate backer may have a silver lining for one group: the Democrats. ``Politically, this is a gift from heaven,'' says Larry Makinson, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. 
Of course, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.) took care not to gloat when he announced that his Governmental Affairs Committee would investigate Enron. ``This is a search for the truth, not a witch hunt,'' Lieberman said on Jan. 2. ``The questions that need to be asked and answered about what happened to Enron are of great public--not partisan--interest.''
Carefully chosen words, especially coming from the man who could be Bush's top challenger for the White House in 2004. And for good reason: The Enron debacle is a minefield. Dems will attempt to make Enron a case study in cozy GOP relations with Big Business and insensitivity to working people, while putting a dent in the President's armor. They'll charge that Enron's generosity to Republicans, who pocketed 73% of Enron's $5.77 million in campaign donations in the past decade, bought looser regulation of energy deals and a blind eye toward accounting conflicts. 
Lieberman will be under pressure from the party leadership to rake the Republicans over the coals. That strategy would score points with the liberal Democratic base he must cultivate if he wants to challenge Bush in 2004. But the longtime pro-business Democrat risks looking like an opportunistic partisan if he moves too aggressively. ``This wasn't Whitewater. This was bad business,'' warns one Democratic lobbyist. ``If they try too hard to connect the dots to the Administration, they might jeopardize the credibility of the whole hearings.'' 
It'll be a hard balance to strike, even for a pol like Lieberman, who has cultivated a persona of high-mindedness. Lieberman criticized President Clinton for his dalliance with Monica Lewinsky and split with his party during investigations into the 1996 fund-raising practices of Clinton and Vice-President Al Gore. That virtuous image helped him land a spot on Gore's 2000 ticket. Says Charles E. Cook Jr., editor of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report: Lieberman is ``good at appearing as though he's earnestly seeking the truth rather than seriously exploiting a situation--even if he is seriously exploiting a situation.'' 
But many Democrats smell GOP blood. Representative Henry A. Waxman (D-Calif.), the top Democrat on the House Government Reform Committee, released details on Jan. 8 of Enron's role in shaping the energy policy drafted last year by Vice-President Dick Cheney. With the Justice Dept. opening a criminal investigation, the Labor Dept. and Securities & Exchange Commission conducting civil probes, and five congressional committees holding hearings, ``the name Enron and its relationship to the Bush family are going to remain in the headlines--and that's not something that displeases your average Democratic strategist,'' says Kim Wallace, chief political analyst for Lehman Brothers Inc. 
Republican leaders aren't counting on Democratic restraint. The GOP-controlled House is launching its own probes, in part to try to insulate Republicans from charges of favoring the company. And Enron will try to capitalize on both parties' fear of a political backlash. ``The public policy issues that this tragedy raises should not be lost in a partisan food fight,'' says Enron's outside counsel, Robert Bennett. 
Business lobbyists are particularly concerned that losses in Enron's 401(k) plans--which have decimated the pensions of many workers--may lead to stiff new regulations. ``When you're dealing with trillions of dollars and the retirement prospects of an aging nation, political lines get drawn quickly,'' says James A. Klein, president of the American Benefits Council, which represents big employers and pension managers. 
Congress' full-throated pursuit of Enron should provide fascinating political theater. But as elections draw near, all sides must avoid overplaying their parts, lest they get booed off the stage.

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE APPOINTEES
Several Administration Officials Held Enron Shares
By DON VAN NATTA Jr. and LESLIE WAYNE

01/18/2002
The New York Times
Page 6, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

WASHINGTON, Jan. 17 -- While much has been made of the huge sums the Enron Corporation invested in the political campaigns of President Bush, some senior members of the Bush administration were also heavily invested in the company's stock. 
Neither President Bush nor Vice President Dick Cheney owned Enron stock when they took office. But at least 30 senior administration officials and ambassadors entered government service last year with personal holdings in Enron stock ranging from several thousand dollars to as much as $50 million, according to a comprehensive review of financial disclosure forms.
Many of those officials sold their shares before Enron collapsed, in most cases because they were required to do so under federal conflict of interest rules. 
The mandated sales were made in the first months of 2001 while the stock was still trading at $60 to $70 a share; the timing helped at least 20 administration officials, including Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's political strategist, avoid losing tens of thousands of dollars. 
But a handful of administration officials who were not required to sell chose to hold their Enron shares through most of last year and presumably sold at a substantial loss after the stock price collapsed. 
A few officials still hold Enron shares, which last traded at 67 cents before the company's stock was dropped from the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday. 
John S. Wolf, assistant secretary of state for nonproliferation, lost approximately $50,000 on his Enron investment last year. Thomas E. White, who was vice chairman of Enron's energy services division, became secretary of the Army last summer owning $25 million to $50 million of Enron shares and another $25 million to $50 million of Enron stock options. 
When he left Enron, Mr. White was paid $1 million and a $13 million ''phantom stock award,'' which is a promise to pay a future bonus in appreciated stock or its cash equivalent. A Pentagon spokesman said he believed that Mr. White abided by his agreement with the Senate Armed Services Committee to sell all his Enron holdings within 90 days of joining the government. 
The investment in Enron by top administration officials ''shows just how close Enron and the Bush administration were,'' said Charles Lewis, executive director of the Center for Public Integrity, a Washington research group. 
Mr. Lewis said that among the questions raised by these holdings were whether any administration officials had special knowledge that affected their Enron trading decisions or whether their Enron holdings posed any conflict of interest. 
''I am not suggesting there is evidence of insider trading,'' he said. ''But a healthy number of them owned Enron, and it is not an unreasonable question to ask how much they owned, when they sold it and why.'' 
Paul C. Light, director of government studies at the Brookings Institution, a Washington research group, said, ''The first question is whether any of these individuals who had a personal interest in Enron's success were involved in any policy making.'' 
Mr. Rove sold 1,350 shares of Enron stock on June 7, after waiting several months for an opinion from the White House counsel's office on the ethics of his wide array of investments. The delay cost Mr. Rove money; had he sold his holdings when he joined the administration, he would have received a far higher price. 
On Jan. 20, Enron stock traded at about $80 a share. On June 7, the share price closed at $55. 
Mr. Rove declined to comment. But Anne Womack, a White House aide, said: ''He had an account with a broker. He purchased stock through the account, just like anyone else who would buy stock. It was purchased over a number of years.'' She declined to say when Mr. Rove had bought his Enron shares or what he paid. 
New appointees to any administration are required by federal law to file a financial disclosure statement, which is reviewed by executive branch lawyers, or Congress in the case of positions requiring confirmation. The date when the statement must be filed varies according to when the person is nominated. 
Based on these statements, questions of potential conflicts of interest can be reviewed by the White House, the executive branch's Office of Government Ethics, specific agencies as well as by Congress, depending on the post. 
''Concern about any stock or financial interests would be based on the work the nominee would be doing,'' said Thomas F. Zorn, chief of financial disclosure at the ethics office. ''Whether this is a conflict would vary from agency to agency. Enron shares might be a problem at one agency, but not at another.'' 
Some administration officials who were not required to sell held their Enron shares through most of 2001 and did not sell until the price dropped to less than $10 a share late last fall. 
''I'm a victim,'' said Mr. Wolf, the State Department official who lost roughly $50,000. He bought Enron shares three times between April and June 2001, when the stock traded between $55 and $65 a share. By the time he sold in late October, the price had fallen to about $10 a share. 
Also selling Enron at a loss was Thomas Dorr, under secretary of agriculture for rural development. Mr. Dorr, owner of Dorr's Pine Grove Farm in Iowa, came into the administration with stocks in 115 companies valued at as much as $4 million. Among them were Enron shares valued at as much as $30,000. 
Alisa Harrison, a spokeswoman at the Agriculture Department, said Mr. Dorr divested all his Enron shares in November. ''They were all sold at a loss,'' she said, adding that the shares had been in Mr. Dorr's individual retirement account. 
One of the wealthier Bush administration officials, Charlotte Beers, the under secretary of state for public diplomacy, owned as much as $250,000 in Enron shares in a portfolio of 150 stocks and investments valued at $38 million. Ms. Beers, a former advertising executive now in charge of the administration's campaign of public diplomacy in the war on terrorism, sold her Enron stake after the company collapsed. 
''Her shares were sold in December 2001 as part of normal portfolio management,'' said Nicholas Griffith, a State Department spokesman. ''Enron was sold with a number of other shares and it all took place in December 2001.'' 
At the Commerce Department, Grant Aldonis, the under secretary for international trade, sold his Enron shares last spring as part of his ethics agreement. Mr. Aldonis, a lawyer and former trade counsel for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, took office with a portfolio valued at as much as $3.3 million, with stock in more than 100 corporations. 
His Enron holdings, then valued between $15,000 and $50,000, were sold before his confirmation last spring. At that time, Enron was trading at around $60 a share. 
The other main holder of Enron shares at the Commerce Department was Kathleen B. Cooper, under secretary for economic affairs. Ms. Cooper, former chief economist at the Exxon Mobil Corporation, had most of her portfolio, which was valued at as much as $6.5 million, invested in Exxon shares. 
Her Enron holdings were sold in June 2001, when the stock traded at around $50 a share, said James Dyke, a spokesman for the Commerce Department. Mr. Dyke added that the sale was not required under her ethics agreement. 
As Enron scrambled last fall to prevent a collapse, Enron executives repeatedly called Peter R. Fisher, the under secretary of treasury for domestic finance, for help -- to no avail. Mr. Fisher spoke six to eight times in October and November with Greg Whalley, Enron's president. 
Mr. Fisher, a former vice president at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, had a portfolio of 66 stocks and mutual funds. Through a trust that will come to him upon the death of his parents, he indirectly held Enron shares that had been valued at $1,000 to $15,000 but are now virtually worthless. 
Other big holders of Enron shares in the Bush administration are ambassadors, most of whom were businessmen before Mr. Bush appointed them to their foreign postings. 
Heading the ambassadors' list of Enron shareholders is Richard J. Egan, the United States ambassador to Ireland and the founder and chairman emeritus of the EMC Corporation, a data storage company. Mr. Egan sold all his shares by June on the advice of his money manager. He had reported to regulators that when he joined the administration he owned Enron stock valued at $250,000 to $500,000, and that he had capital gains of more than $100,000 on the sale of those shares. 
Two other White House officials held Enron shares ranging in value from $1,000 to $15,000: I. Lewis Libby, Mr. Cheney's chief of staff, and Nicholas Calio, the assistant to the president for legislative affairs. Mr. Libby sold his Enron shares on Feb. 25 last year, and he made a profit of $14, a White House spokeswoman said. Mr. Calio sold his 15 shares of Enron stock last August, she said.

Enron's Influence Reached Deep Into Administration; Ties Touched Personnel and Policies

As presidential candidate George W. Bush's top economic adviser in 2000, Lawrence B. Lindsey was also a paid consultant to Enron Corp. At one point, those two roles merged. 
For $50,000 a year, Lindsey attended meetings in 1999 and 2000 of the energy company's economic "advisory board." In those sessions, Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay convinced Lindsey of the wisdom behind one of Enron's businesses, a consulting operation that advised companies on energy efficiency.
"It stuck with me," Lindsey said in an interview yesterday. 
In fact, Lindsey incorporated Lay's ideas into the Bush campaign's energy policy. During the campaign, Lindsey described Lay's contribution as key. 
The cozy relationship -- in which a Bush campaign adviser, being paid by Enron, placed an Enron idea on the candidate's agenda -- served as one more reminder of the political influence and reach of the once-giant energy company. Its ties extend deep into President Bush's staff, appointments, Cabinet members, friends, family -- and his own past. 
According to financial records, 35 administration officials have held Enron stock. A few, such as top Bush political adviser Karl Rove, had six-figure holdings. Several others -- Lindsey, U.S. Trade Representative Robert B. Zoellick, Commerce Department general counsel Theodore W. Kassinger, Maritime Administrator William G. Schubert -- served as paid Enron consultants. 
Bush's secretary of the Army, Thomas E. White, was vice chairman of the Enron business that Lay had described to Lindsey during the campaign. White had held between $25 million and $50 million in Enron stock in addition to options and other forms of remuneration. Newly appointed Republican National Committee Chairman Marc F. Racicot was an Enron lobbyist. Bush campaign adviser Ed Gillespie, sent in when Bush took office to get the Commerce Department up and running, was an Enron lobbyist. 
Still others, such as Attorney General John D. Ashcroft and Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, received campaign contributions from Enron, while many more -- including Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey L. Pitt, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Chairman Patrick H. Wood III and Deputy Attorney General Larry D. Thompson -- have indirect ties to Enron or auditor Arthur Andersen. And Enron consulted on policy with top administration officials such as Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans, Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill and Vice President Cheney. 
There has been no indication that the administration's ties to Enron are illegal, and the giant company had similar connections to several Democrats and Republicans in Congress. But the sheer volume of Enron connections to the executive branch offers a study in the long reach of a powerful campaign contributor and aggressive corporation. Though the administration says it made no effort to keep Enron afloat, the extensive ties between the two may present Bush with a political difficulty if Democrats can create a perception of guilt by association. 
Enron began in 1985 as a traditional gas pipeline company, but transformed itself into an innovative trader of gas, electricity and other commodities. Its stock became a Wall Street favorite as it tried to enter markets for fiber-optics, movie rentals, paper, even advertising. Many of its businesses were regulated or otherwise affected by federal decisions. 
Enron and its executives poured millions of dollars into the political process -- $1.7 million in the 2000 election alone, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. 
Over the years, a series of actions by Congress and the FERC, which broke down the old monopoly of utility companies over power plants and transmission lines, benefited Enron. The company successfully lobbied for a regulatory exemption for futures trading in energy "derivatives," complex financial instruments that became its most lucrative business and contributed to its downfall. The Bush administration sometimes rebuffed Enron, however, such as when it refused to embrace an Enron-backed position on combating global warming. 
Bush last week played down his ties to Lay. He said he "first got to know Ken" in 1994, when "he was a supporter of Ann Richards," the Democratic Texas governor whom Bush ousted. In fact, Bush knew Lay from their work on the 1992 Republican National Convention and the Bush presidential library. The current president received $47,500 from Lay and his wife in 1994 -- many times what Richards received. Lay has said he supported Bush, not Richards, in 1994. 
Over the years, Lay and Enron interests have contributed more than a half million dollars to Bush campaign funds, according to the Center for Public Integrity, making him Bush's greatest patron. The Bush presidential campaign reimbursed Enron for use of its corporate jets. Lay, who got the nickname "Kenny Boy" from Bush, served on Bush's presidential transition advisory team for the Energy Department. Enron employee Cynthia Sandherr served on the transition team for the Commerce Department. 
In the White House, four senior officials were listed as Enron shareholders. Three of them -- Cheney chief of staff I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby, congressional liaison Nicholas E. Calio and former communications adviser Margaret Tutwiler -- likely sold their interests or were not required to under ethics rules; full details will not be made public until May. 
The fourth, Rove, whose Enron holdings were valued between $100,000 and $250,000, sold his shares last year after the value had fallen to $68,000; the Enron shares, which the White House said Rove purchased on his own, were part of a portfolio worth more than $2.3 million. 
White House counsel Alberto R. Gonzales acknowledged last June that Rove took part in meetings that helped shape the administration's energy policy while he still owned stock in Enron and other energy companies. Gonzales, however, said the meetings were general in nature and not specific enough to be barred by conflict-of-interest regulations. 
Also tied to Enron is Lindsey. His consulting firm, Economic Strategies Inc., counted an Enron unit among its many clients. Counting speaking fees and his multi-client business, Lindsey earned more than $1.1 million in 2000. 
White House press secretary Ari Fleischer said that Lindsey, before Enron's Dec. 2 bankruptcy filing, led a White House "review" that monitored the impact of Enron's woes on energy markets. Lindsey said it was merely part of an ongoing monitoring of the energy markets by one or two aides. Democrats in Congress yesterday said Lindsey's actions may have violated federal conflict-of-interest regulations. Lindsey said his work was not "Enron-specific." 
Cheney, himself a former Texas energy executive, was on a first-name basis with Lay, who met with the vice president to discuss development of the administration's national energy policy. In all, the vice president's office disclosed, the energy task force met six times with Enron representatives. Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Calif.), a critic of the task force, said "it seems clear that there is no company in the country that stood to gain as much from the White House plan as Enron." 
A number of senior Bush aides have had routine or incidental contact with Enron. White House Chief of Staff Andrew H. Card Jr. was alerted by Commerce's Evans about a call from Lay expressing a desire for government help in the weeks before its bankruptcy. Bush budget director Mitchell E. Daniels Jr. received a call from Lay in October about prospects for the economic stimulus package. That package, as passed by the House, included a tax provision that would have provided Enron with a $254 million rebate, according to the Congressional Research Service. 
Even Bush's homeland security director, Tom Ridge, had Enron ties. At Lay's urging, Bush called Ridge in 1997 when he was Pennsylvania governor to help with Enron's bid -- eventually successful -- to enter the Pennsylvania market. 
At the Justice Department, Ashcroft and staff chief David Ayres -- Ashcroft's former campaign manager -- recused themselves from the Enron probe because of Enron contributions to Ashcroft's campaign funds. 
The Justice Department decided that deputy staff chief David Israelite and communications director Barbara Comstock need not recuse themselves; both had worked for the Republican National Committee, which received hundreds of thousands of dollars from Enron. Thompson, Ashcroft's deputy, was a partner in a law firm, King & Spalding, that represented Enron, but he disagreed with a Democratic lawmaker who said Thompson should disqualify himself. 
After Commerce's Evans received a call from Lay in which the Enron chief said he would value government calls to a private credit rating agency, Evans called into his office his counsel, Kassinger. Kassinger had earlier said he had provided "legal services" to Enron while a trade lawyer at the firm Vinson & Elkins LLP in Houston, Enron's hometown. Ultimately, Evans said, he decided not to intervene. 
Treasury's O'Neill, who also got a call from Lay concerning Enron's dire finances, handed the matter over to Peter R. Fisher, the undersecretary for domestic finance. Fisher had holdings in Enron valued between $1,000 and $15,000 when he joined the administration, as did Mark A. Weinberger, the assistant treasury secretary for tax policy. Treasury's spokeswoman said Fisher's modest holdings were part of a trust that he does not control. O'Neill said the department provided no help to Enron, although it consulted with lenders. 
Elsewhere in the administration, Trade Representative Zoellick received $50,000 in advisory fees from Enron and listed stock holdings between $15,000 and $50,000 -- relatively small percentages of his overall earnings and holdings (Zoellick sold his shares after joining the administration). 
A score of other administration officials had Enron holdings, ranging from relatively small stakes held by Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and Export Import Bank Chairman John E. Robson to holdings exceeding $100,000 by Charlotte L. Beers, the undersecretary of state for public diplomacy. 
At the SEC, Pitt faced requests this week from congressional Democrats and the watchdog group Common Cause that he remove himself from his agency's Enron investigation because he had been a securities lawyer who represented Andersen, Enron's auditor. FERC Chairman Wood, a friend of Lay's, replaced Curtis Hebert Jr. Hebert told the New York Times last year that Lay had said he wouldn't back his reappointment unless Hebert changed his views on electricity deregulation. 
Even since its bankruptcy filing, the vestiges of Enron continue to touch those around the president. Bush's brother, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, flew to Houston yesterday for a $500-per-person fundraiser at the home of a former Enron president.

Accounting for Enron: Investigation Raises Oliver North Problem --- Congressional Testimony Can Taint Prosecutions
By Kathryn Kranhold and Tom Hamburger
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

C15

Will the Justice Department investigation of Enron Corp. face an Oliver North problem? 
In May 1989, the retired Marine lieutenant colonel was found guilty in the Iran-Contra scandal. But his conviction was later reversed, as was the conviction of former National Security Adviser John Poindexter, after two of three judges in Washington's Circuit Court of Appeals found that witnesses for the prosecution were tainted by the two men's public testimony before Congress.
Now, the Justice Department is ramping up to investigate Enron as Congress is also mounting major investigations. Just as prosecutors start interviewing people, Congress is negotiating with top executives at Enron and its auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, to testify at public hearings. 
People who testify before Congress in such situations are occasionally granted limited immunity, called "use immunity," that protects them from having their statements used against them in a criminal investigation. But such a grant of immunity presents problems for prosecutors in a subsequent criminal case. 
Dan Webb, who as deputy independent counsel prosecuted Mr. Poindexter, says prosecutors in any Enron case would have a "huge burden" of proof to show that their investigation and witnesses weren't influenced by any congressional testimony presented under a grant of immunity. 
"That becomes very difficult and sometimes almost impossible to do," said Mr. Webb, of Winston & Strawn. 
It isn't clear whether any of the major players in the Enron affair will be granted immunity in exchange for their congressional testimony. David Duncan, the Arthur Andersen auditor fired this week for shredding Enron documents, has agreed to cooperate but it is still not determined under what terms he might testify before Congress. 
Before this week's explosion of revelations, Enron's chairman and chief executive, Kenneth Lay, was expected to testify Feb. 4. Enron's former chief executive, Jeffrey Skilling, has said he would testify. It isn't clear whether Enron's former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, who ran the questionable partnerships that contributed to Enron's downfall, will also testify. 
Both Messrs. North and Poindexter were granted limited immunity before Congress. That meant that prosecutors couldn't use the men's public testimony to aid their investigation, including leading them to evidence or witnesses they hadn't discovered on their own. Additionally, witnesses called by the prosecution couldn't use Mr. North's congressional testimony to help them remember the details of a significant event or meeting. 
To ensure Mr. North's statements didn't taint the case, Independent Counsel Lawrence E. Walsh and his team of prosecutors didn't read the newspapers. One prosecutor took his glasses off in the subway so that he couldn't read the headlines on other passengers' newspapers. While watching television, they carried remote controls so they could easily hit the mute buttons. Mr. Walsh recalls: "We got pretty sharp at that."

News: Analysis & Commentary: Enron Watch: COMMENTARY
Enron: How Governance Rules Failed The audit committee followed all the rules--but it let shareholders down
By Louis Lavelle

01/21/2002
BusinessWeek

(Copyright 2002 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)

One of the mysteries of Enron Corp.'s fall from grace is how an audit committee chock full of talent could have been blind to the company's financial sleight of hand. So far, speculation has centered around the apparent failure of Enron's auditors, Arthur Andersen LLP, to alert the audit committee to the problem until very late in the game. But the truth is, the audit committee deserves much of the blame for Enron's collapse--and the corporate governance movement deserves much of the blame for the Enron audit committee. 
Whatever its flaws, the committee followed all the rules laid down by federal regulators, stock exchanges, and governance experts regarding director pay, independence, disclosure, and financial expertise. Enron collapsed in large part because the rules didn't accomplish what the experts hoped they would. For example: -- Paying directors with stock may have aligned their interests with shareholders', but it's just as likely to have created a motive for not asking the tough questions. -- Disclosure rules may have alerted investors to the fact that one audit committee member had a potential conflict of interest, but not that two others did as well. -- The Enron audit committee may have been exactly what the stock exchanges had in mind in December, 1999, when they required that members demonstrate financial know-how--but the expertise may have been out of date following the changes Enron went through in the 1990s. In any case, it didn't help the committee make sense of Enron's tangled finances.
Bottom line: It may be time to rethink the rules. 
Certainly there was nothing unusual about the Enron directors' heavy stock ownership. Boards in general have bought into the argument by governance experts that directors should get paid largely with stock to make sure they act in the best interest of shareholders. Of the top 200 companies, 99% pay directors with stock, up from 81% in 1995. And 62% of director pay comes in equity, up from 24% in 1995, according to pay consultant Pearl Meyer & Partners. 
Clearly, stock is king. But should it be? Auditors are prohibited by the Securities & Exchange Commission from owning stock in client companies precisely because of its potential to corrupt. Yet audit committee members, like all directors, are essentially required to own stock, presumably because it keeps them honest. Three of the six audit committee members owned nearly 100,000 Enron shares worth a total of more than $7.5 million as of Feb. 15--shares that surely would have plummeted in value had directors forced management to come clean about the risks of some of the company's off-balance-sheet partnerships. 
The committee's failure to force an earlier and more public explanation of Enron's finances suggests to some that the shares, instead of making shareholder interests the directors' top priority, did the opposite--in effect buying their silence. ``Did greed blind them? I think it's very possible,'' says John M. Nash, co-founder of the National Association of Corporate Directors. In fact, one lawsuit alleges just that, claiming that Enron insiders--including three current audit committee members--sold 17.3 million shares for $1.1 billion to an unsuspecting public while issuing financial statements later revealed to be pure fiction. The audit committee members either declined to comment or did not return calls. But Enron says the board since 1999 approved the most controversial partnerships, established controls, and acted ``quickly'' in November to restate earnings when the problems became apparent, albeit weeks after Enron's shares plunged amid questions about the partnerships. 
It's hard to argue that directors shouldn't own shares at all. But banning sales by directors for the duration of their terms would motivate directors to preserve a company's long-term value instead of taking a see-no-evil approach to oversight. 
If the stock didn't blind the Enron audit committee members, their financial ties to the company may have. It's a problem that governance critics anticipated. But what's troublesome is that SEC disclosure rules required Enron to make known only one of those ties: director John Wakeham's $6,000-a-month consulting contract. One would need to venture far afield from Enron's securities filings to learn from the University of Texas that Enron, Chairman Kenneth Lay, and their foundations had given $332,150 to the school's M.D. Anderson Cancer Center since 1999. That's when center President John Mendelsohn became an Enron director. Also undisclosed by Enron: $50,000 that the company and the Lay family foundation gave to George Mason University's Mercatus Center, where Wendy Lee Gramm has been head of regulatory studies since she joined the center in 1997. Enron and its employees also made political contributions of more than $80,000 to her husband, Senator Phil Gramm (R-Tex.), since she became an Enron director in 1993. 
Governance experts say the audit committee's lack of independence made it less inclined to question management. ``These are humans,'' says Richard H. Koppes, former general counsel for the California Public Employees' Retirement System. ``You're not going to want to rock the boat.'' At the very least, investors were entitled to know that half the committee had financial ties to the company. The SEC should move quickly to propose a rule, long sought by institutional investors, requiring the disclosure of all financial ties with directors--personal, family, business, political and philanthropic. Using that standard, about 30% of the nearly 1,200 companies tracked by the Investor Responsibility Research Center have audit committees that are less than 100% independent. 
One of the few areas where Enron disclosed a wealth of information was in the qualifications of board members. On paper, the audit committee was as qualified as any, more than fulfilling the 1999 requirement by stock exchanges that members demonstrate financial literacy. Committee Chairman Robert K. Jaedicke was a Stanford University accounting professor for 30 years. Ronnie C. Chan and Paulo V. Ferraz Pereira are executives. Mendelsohn runs a university cancer center. Gramm is an economist. And Wakeham belongs to the House of Lords. 
Yet, as a group, they were apparently unable to decipher the tangled web of off-balance-sheet deals that effectively hid Enron's debt and inflated its earnings. Jaedicke, 72, has been retired for more than a decade. Some have suggested privately that he may not have been up to speed on the complex financing strategies that were so integral to Enron's rapid transformation from an energy pipeline company into a trading outfit. Some governance experts now conclude that meeting the textbook definition of financial literacy is not a guarantee that directors understand sophisticated financial instruments. 
The truth is that the ideal audit committee envisioned by the rules governing independence and financial literacy is to some extent a mythical beast. Big global companies are now so complex that insiders are often the only people who truly understand them. But only outsiders have the independence to rein them in. And many boards don't exercise the diligent oversight companies need. A new survey of audit committees at 50 U.S. companies by Joseph V. Carcello, an associate accounting professor at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville, found they typically meet just three times a year, only two-thirds bother to review their companies' internal audits, and fewer than one in five have unrestricted access to company records. Enron's committee met five times in 2000; the company's proxy is unclear on whether it reviewed the internal audit or had unfettered access to records. 
If nothing else, the Enron debacle should occasion some soul-searching on the part of federal regulators and stock exchanges that make the governance rules. It would help if audit committees were required to convene meetings more frequently, conduct an annual review of the internal audit, and educate members in more than just the balance-sheet basics. ``Ultimately,'' says Alan Cleveland, counsel to the New Hampshire Retirement System, an Enron shareholder, ``what it comes down to is what goes on not only in the boardroom but in the minds of these outside directors.'' For governance to work, directors need to understand that their job is to keep tabs on management--not simply show up.

Costly Lessons
Here's where the Enron board's audit committee came up short and some possible
fixes.
DISCLOSURE
Companies are required to disclose some, but not all, financial ties with
directors. Critics have cited conflicts at Enron, which correctly disclosed
its consulting contract with one audit-committee member, but not the
charitable contributions made to affiliated organizations of two others.
SOLUTION: Disclose all financial ties.
KNOW-HOW
Audit-committee members must demonstrate basic financial literacy, and one
must have financial expertise. Enron's committee included an accounting
professor, an economist, and two businessmen. But they apparently didn't
understand the risks in some of the company's complex limited partnerships.
SOLUTION: Committees should have to meet more often, review internal audits,
and get industry-specific finance training.
COMPENSATION
Most companies pay directors largely in stock to align their interests with
those of shareholders. But at Enron, where some directors sold shares near the
August, 2000, high, large holdings may have made directors less willing to ask
tough questions.
SOLUTION: Pay in stock, but ban stock sales as long as directors are on the
board.

THE MORTICIANS MOVE IN Lawyers, investment bankers, and accountants could walk away with as much as $300 million
By Dan Carney in Washington, with Emily Thornton in New York and bureau reports

01/21/2002
BusinessWeek

(Copyright 2002 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)

When Houston-based energy company Dynegy Inc. pulled out of a deal to buy troubled Enron Corp. last Nov. 28, attorneys at the firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges knew they had to act fast. Enron's stock was plunging below a dollar, its credit rating had collapsed, and creditors suddenly had the right to call in loans and seize buildings, pipelines, and other assets the company had put up as collateral. ``We were hearing rumors about unilateral actions by creditors,'' says Weil Gotshal partner Martin J. Bienenstock. ``And we wanted to stop that.'' 
So the law firm, which Enron retained in October, threw everything it had into the case. Dozens of lawyers worked around the clock preparing a petition for Chapter 11 protection. When they finished four days later, they immediately filed electronically with bankruptcy court--even though it was 5 a.m. on a Sunday morning. By acting so quickly, the lawyers claim they kept Enron's creditors from tearing the company apart.
They've been busy ever since. Indeed, Enron's misfortune is proving to be Weil Gotshal's blessing. By the time the bankruptcy is over, the firm could rake in as much as $30 million in fees. More than a dozen other law firms are also on the case. And the attorneys are joined by a small army of investment bankers, such as Blackstone Group, which is charging $350,000 a month, plus a $35 million bonus if the company reemerges from Chapter 11. All in all, the various hired guns managing history's largest bankruptcy will earn fees of as much as $300 million or more. 
They are under a tight deadline and operating in a highly charged environment. On Jan. 9, the situation became even more electric as the Justice Dept. confirmed that it has opened a criminal investigation into the fall of Enron. That is likely to be a serious distraction for the lawyers, bankers, and accountants, but for now, they are focused almost exclusively on auctioning a majority stake in Enron's highly successful trading unit, set to be completed on Jan. 10. A quick sale is seen as critical because the unit is rapidly losing out to more stable rivals. ``The idea is that this is like ripe fruit,'' says one attorney close to the case. ``If it doesn't move quickly, it will rot.'' 
These are boom times for the morticians of the business world. It is a diverse group that also includes accountants and turnaround specialists--management consultants, such as Jay Alix & Associates, that specialize in rescuing insolvent companies. Last year, 255 publicly traded companies filed for bankruptcy, breaking the prior record of 176 in 2000, according to BankruptcyData.com. ``It's not as if I get up in the morning and say, `I want to get rich off this,''' says Luc A. Despins, a partner at Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy and lead counsel to Enron's creditors. ``But all of us have tons of work right now.'' 
Unlike prior downturns, where bankruptcies have been concentrated in troubled industries such as airlines and retail, the current wave of failures is unusually broad. It runs across a wide swath of businesses, including Pacific Gas & Electric, LTV, Excite@Home, and Fruit of the Loom. Even though the debtors are more diverse than ever, the bankruptcy business is dominated by a small club. There are perhaps a dozen law firms--and even fewer investment banks--with the armies of experts a big company in trouble needs on short notice. 
So far, the Enron case has attracted many of the big guns. Among law firms, Weil Gotshal has the most prominent bankruptcy practice. Milbank Tweed is the leading specialist in the representation of creditors. Other top bankruptcy shops include Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz; Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom; and Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering. Top partners at these firms bill $700 an hour and earn more than $2 million annually. 
What do they do to earn the big bucks? They work day and night to come up with a restructuring plan that will enable a viable company to emerge from bankruptcy. Corporate boards are more than willing to pay the fees of lawyers who can stave off an all-out fire sale of assets. 
Bienenstock's goal is to bring Enron out of bankruptcy as soon as a year from now. Once the trading unit auction is complete, his next major task will be selling overseas assets, including a $2.9 billion power plant in India and a power plant, electricity grid, and gas-pipeline company in Brazil. Many of the projects are losing money and are joint ventures with those governments. It is uncertain who would be interested in these assets. 
Given the company's complexity and potential legal problems, most observers are betting it will take Bienenstock twice as long as he'd like to bring Enron around. That could be bad news for the company, since creditors tend to push harder for liquidation the longer bankruptcy proceedings drag on. ``I'd put his chances [of a successful reorganization] at about 30%,'' says University of Houston Law School Dean and bankruptcy professor Nancy Rapaport. ``At some point, creditors might say, `You've liquidated some, we think you should keep going.''' 
While Weil Gotshal has had some notable successes--including the 1990 restructuring of Federated Department Stores--it also has plenty of critics. The firm's bruising tactics have earned it the nickname ``We'll Getcha and Mangle Ya'' among rivals. It has also occasionally run into trouble with bankruptcy trustees. In 1992, an employee of the U.S. Trustee in Connecticut accused the firm of padding its bills in a case involving gunmaker Colt's Manufacturing Co. Weil denies it, and no penalty was imposed. In 1994, though, the firm was penalized $1 million for not reporting conflicts in the bankruptcy of Leslie Fay Cos. The trustee in that case was none other than U.S. District Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez--the man hearing the Enron bankruptcy. But the two sides have met on cases with no sign of ill will since. 
Standing side by side with the attorneys in the Enron bankruptcy are the investment bankers. While not nearly so numerous as the lawyers, they tend to make more money. Indeed, restructuring work is fetching larger fees than ever because of the difficulty of valuing and selling bankrupt assets. Since many bigger investment banks dropped out of the bankruptcy business when the economy picked up in the early 1990s, it is now dominated by boutiques such as Blackstone, Lazard, and CIBC World Markets. 
The auction of Enron's trading unit has been largely handled by Blackstone. Boutique shop Batchelder & Partners Inc., meanwhile, has poured over the books in search of overlooked assets. Because of the pressure to move quickly, it has been grueling. ``We've been heavily involved on a full-time basis, which includes weekends,'' says Steven M. Zelin, a senior managing director at Blackstone. For Enron's undertakers, that's likely to continue for some time.

Where the Money Is Going
The biggest bankruptcy in history is making a small industry of advisers rich
ENRON'S LAWYERS
The oil giant has turned to Corporate America's leading bankruptcy counsel,
Weil, Gotshal & Manges. The firm charges $700 per hour for top guns and could
ultimately earn up to $30 million.
CREDITORS' LAWYERS
Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy dominates the business of representing
creditors and is expected to earn $15 million to $30 million on the Enron
case.
INVESTMENT BANKERS
Blackstone Group, Enron's lead banker, will get $350,000 a month, plus a $35
million ``success fee'' if it accomplishes a successful reorganization.  It's
backed by Batchelder & Partners, which is making a $15 million success fee, or
$375,000 a month if the reorganization attempt fails.
ACCOUNTANTS
While Enron is in bankruptcy, Cap Gemini Ernst & Young, as well as other
firms, will advise the parties to the bankruptcy. Fees are yet to be
determined, but accountants often earn up to $200,000 a month.

THE PERILS OF J.P. MORGAN Enron, Argentina, the bear market-a year after the merger with Chase, the bank is racking up losses
By Heather Timmons in New York, with Christopher Palmeri in Los Angeles

(Copyright 2002 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)

When Chase Manhattan swooped in to bid $33 billion for white-shoe investment bank J.P. Morgan in September, 2000, Chief Executive William B. Harrison Jr. claimed that the new behemoth would provide ``huge'' growth. The idea was simple: Thousands of Chase's corporate customers would be pushed into J.P. Morgan's arms and pay fat fees for takeover deals, securities issues, and the like. Nor was the strategy far-fetched. After all, Citibank and Travelers Group had successfully combined in 1998 to produce a bull-market juggernaut that was leaving rivals, including Chase, in the dust. 
The reality has turned out to be a lot different. Instead of striking the new gusher of profits promised by Harrison, the merged J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. has tapped into a seemingly endless well of red ink. As a result, the new bank is ending its first full year by taking huge write-downs and making expensive additions to loan loss reserves. Analysts figure anything from $800 million to over $2 billion will be sliced off the fourth-quarter operating earnings to be announced on Jan. 16. Piled on top of second-quarter charges of about $1 billion, net income for 2001 could drop as low as $3.5 billion, down from the $5.7 billion that J.P. Morgan and Chase Manhattan together earned in 2000.
Admittedly, 2001 was the worst year for investment banking in nearly a decade. Mergers and acquisitions dried up, as did stock offerings and syndicated lending. Moreover, as the global economy worsened and the bear market dragged on, corporate lending and private equity took major hits as well. 
More than bad luck with the timing of its merger could be dogging J.P. Morgan, however. Some analysts argue that the bank regularly runs much bigger risks than its rivals and is now paying the price. The bank's exposure to bankrupt energy trader Enron Corp.'s loans, and energy and derivatives contracts, has grown to $2.6 billion. It has $900 million in exposure to Argentina and its $117 billion commercial loan portfolio is facing a series of high-profile losses--thanks to bankruptcies among its telecom customers, as well as Enron. The value of its private equity portfolio, the largest of any U.S. bank, has been a major drag on earnings since the Nasdaq crash in March, 2000. And analysts have started to worry that the bank's off-balance-sheet assets could be a future source of losses. ``I think their risk profile is greatly understated,'' says Charles Peabody, an analyst with independent researcher Ventana Capital. 
J.P. Morgan executives balk at any suggestion they deliberately court more risks than their peers. They argue that investors and analysts are punishing the bank because it has been more scrupulous about reporting potential losses. The company's stock has sunk 22% since the merger was announced in 2000. ``We're a lightning rod for credit issues because we've been more up-front than other participants in the market,'' says Chief Financial Officer Dina Dublon. Indeed, J.P. Morgan has been more open than others in some matters. It posts its private equity portfolio online. And it told analysts about its Argentina exposure when the country careened toward default. Citigroup, by contrast, doesn't detail its private equity holdings. Nor has it given details on its exposure to Argentina, which analysts estimate at $4 billion, beyond saying that country contributes less than 2% of earnings. 
Still, it's unnerving how the bad news keeps piling up at J.P. Morgan. Because the bank was one of the largest lenders to Enron, as well as an adviser in the aborted Dynegy Inc. takeover bid, analysts weren't surprised when it announced on Nov. 28 that it had $900 million in exposure to the energy company. The real shocker was the disclosure on Dec. 19 that the bank's unsecured exposure to Enron had tripled, to $1.6 billion, after insurers failed to make good on nearly $1 billion in guarantees on Enron gas contracts. Called surety bonds, the guarantees were issued to Mahonia Natural Gas, a J.P. Morgan ``special purpose vehicle'' created to handle commodity contracts with Enron. The bank is suing the nine insurers to force them to pay up, but they are fighting back. Meantime, analysts say the belated disclosure has hurt the bank's reputation. 
Corporate lending problems don't end there. J.P. Morgan and Citi assembled a group of banks that lent telecom company Global Crossing Ltd.--now deeply troubled--more than $2.2 billion in its palmier days. Normally, banks take precedence over other lenders in a bankruptcy, but that may not be so with Global Crossing, says Aryeh B. Bourkoff, a distressed-debt analyst at UBS Warburg. Because of the way the loan is structured, he says, other creditors could be paid first if Global Crossing goes under. The point isn't academic: Global Crossing lost $1.9 billion on revenues of $2.4 billion in the first nine months of last year, and its bank debt sells for 20 cents on the dollar, far below that of other distressed telecom companies. J.P. Morgan and the other banks have been negotiating to stretch out the loan and cut the interest rates charged on it in exchange for new collateral. In late December, the bankers gave the company until Feb. 13 to reach an agreement. J.P. Morgan insists that its loan is, in fact, secured. CFO Dublon says analysts should look beyond these black marks. ``We're still going to be profitable,'' she says. 
Indeed the market may be exaggerating some of J.P. Morgan's risks. For example, its Argentina exposure is smaller than the likes of Citi or FleetBoston Financial. And Brian O'Neill, J.P. Morgan's chairman of Latin America, says the loans are predominantly to large commercial and industrial enterprises, many of them subsidiaries of foreign companies and therefore less likely to be affected by the peso devaluation. 
Still, there's more bad news ahead. J.P. Morgan Partners, the bank's private equity unit, will need to write down $100 million on its investment in telecom outfit Triton PCS Inc. And losses could be even more severe in its $8 billion portfolio of privately held companies. Fox-Pitt Kelton analyst E. Reilly Tierney expects the unit will have to take $600 million in write-downs for the last quarter of 2001. Further losses are likely from the bank's off-balance-sheet dealings. It founded, and is by far the largest market maker in, the $1 trillion market for credit derivatives, a form of loan insurance. Issuers of these derivatives lose money if insured borrowers don't repay their loans. In the third quarter, banks lost $99 million in derivatives, says the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Nearly all of that--$95 million--was borne by J.P. Morgan alone, says Ventana's Peabody, who expects more losses to come. J.P. Morgan's head of credit derivatives, Andy Brindle, says the bank made substantial profits on its overall derivatives portfolio in the first nine months of 2001, while losses are on credit derivatives were ``insignificant.'' 
The litany of woes at J.P. Morgan seems endless. Bank executives remain philosophical that times are bound to be tough when the economy tanks. ``Extending credit is the business we're in, and we're at the point that credit losses are going higher,'' says Dublon. There's no arguing with that. But sooner or later, the brass are going to have to make good on their boss's promises of future growth to placate critics.

HOLD THE RATINGS AGENCIES TO A HIGHER STANDARD

``The fall of Enron'' (Cover Story, Dec. 17) stated that Enron's maze of partnerships made it very difficult for rating firms such as Standard & Poor's to verify many of its debts. You even went further and stated that, even now, nobody really knows what other off-balance sheet liabilities exist. If that is the case, then what about other companies that have similar assets and potential liabilities off their books? What ratings should such firms be given? 
It is high time that rating firms such as S&P informed their clients of such off-balance sheet items--so that nasty accounting malpractices such as those that overtook Enron do not take bankers, investors, employees, and creditors by surprise.

Just four days before Enron disclosed a stunning $618 million loss for the third quarter--its first public disclosure of its financial woes--workers who audited the company's books for Arthur Andersen, the big accounting firm, received an extraordinary instruction from one of the company's lawyers. Congressional investigators tell TIME that the Oct. 12 memo directed workers to destroy all audit material, except for the most basic "work papers." And that's what they did, over a period of several weeks. As a result, FBI investigators, congressional probers and workers suing the company for lost retirement savings will be denied thousands of e-mails and other electronic and paper files that could have helped illuminate the actions and motivations of Enron executives involved in what now is the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history. 
Supervisors at Arthur Andersen repeatedly reminded their employees of the document-destruction memo in the weeks leading up to the first Security and Exchange Commission subpoenas that were issued on Nov. 8. And the firm declines to rule out the possibility that some destruction continued even after that date. Its workers had destroyed "a significant but undetermined number" of documents related to Enron, the accounting firm acknowledged in a terse public statement last Thursday. But it did not reveal that the destruction orders came in the Oct. 12 memo. Sources close to Arthur Andersen confirm the basic contents of the memo, but spokesman David Tabolt said it would be "inappropriate" to discuss it until the company completes its own review of the explosive issue.
Though there are no firm rules on how long accounting firms must retain documents, most hold on to a wide range of them for several years. Any deliberate destruction of documents subject to subpoena is illegal. In Arthur Andersen's dealings with the documents related to Enron, "the mind-set seemed to be, If not required to keep it, then get rid of it," says Ken Johnson, spokesman for the House Energy and Commerce Committee, whose investigators first got wind of the Oct. 12 memo and which is pursuing one of half a dozen investigations of Enron. "Anyone who destroyed records out of stupidity should be fired," said committee chairman Billy Tauzin, a Louisiana Republican. "Anyone who destroyed records to try to circumvent our investigation should be prosecuted." 
The accounting for a global trading company like Enron is mind- numbingly complex. But it's crucial to learning how the company fell so far so fast, taking with it the jobs and pension savings of thousands of workers and inflicting losses on millions of individual investors. At the heart of Enron's demise was the creation of partnerships with shell companies, many with names like Chewco and JEDI, inspired by Star Wars characters. These shell companies, run by Enron executives who profited richly from them, allowed Enron to keep hundreds of millions of dollars in debt off its books. But once stock analysts and financial journalists heard about these arrangements, investors began to lose confidence in the company's finances. The results: a run on the stock, lowered credit ratings and insolvency. 
Shredded evidence is only one of the issues that will get close scrutiny in the Enron case. The U.S. Justice Department announced last week that it was creating a task force, staffed with experts on complex financial crimes, to pursue a full criminal investigation. But the country was quickly reminded of the pervasive reach of Enron and its executives--the biggest contributors to the Presidential campaign of George W. Bush--when U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft had to recuse himself from the probe because he had received $57,499 in campaign cash from Enron for his failed 2000 Senate re-election bid in Missouri. Then the entire office of the U.S. Attorney in Houston recused itself because too many of its prosecutors had personal ties to Enron executives--or to angry workers who have been fired or have seen their life savings disappear. 
Texas attorney general John Cornyn, who launched an investigation in December into 401(k) losses at Enron and possible tax liabilities owed to Texas, recused himself because since 1997 he has accepted $158,000 in campaign contributions from the company. "I know some of the Enron execs, and there has been contact, but there was no warning," he says of the collapse. 
Bush told reporters that he had not talked with Enron CEO Kenneth L. Lay about the company's woes. But the White House later acknowledged that Lay, a longtime friend of Bush's, had lobbied Commerce Secretary Don Evans and Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill. Lay called O'Neill to inform him of Enron's shaky finances and to warn that because of the company's key role in energy markets, its collapse could send tremors through the whole economy. Lay compared Enron to Long-Term Capital Management, a big hedge fund whose near collapse in 1998 required a bailout organized by the Federal Reserve Board. He asked Evans whether the Administration might do something to help Enron maintain its credit rating. Both men declined to help. 
An O'Neill deputy, Peter Fisher, got similar calls from Enron's president and from Robert Rubin, the former Treasury Secretary who now serves as a top executive at Citigroup, which had at least $800 million in exposure to Enron through loans and insurance policies. Fisher--who had helped organize the LTCM bailout--judged that Enron's slide didn't pose the same dangers to the financial system and advised O'Neill against any bailout or intervention with lenders or credit-rating agencies. 
On the evidence to date, the Bush Administration would seem to have admirably rebuffed pleas for favors from its most generous business supporter. But it didn't tell that story very effectively-- encouraging speculation that it has something to hide. Democrats in Congress, frustrated by Bush's soaring popularity and their own inability to move pet legislation through Congress, smelled a chance to link Bush and his party to the richest tale of greed, self- dealing and political access since junk-bond king Michael Milken was jailed in 1991. That's just what the President, hoping to convert momentum from his war on terrorism to the war on recession, desperately wants to avoid. The fallout will swing on the following key questions: 
WAS A CRIME COMMITTED? 
The justice investigation will be overseen in Washington by a seasoned hand, Josh Hochberg, head of the fraud section and the first to listen to the FBI tape of Linda Tripp and Monica Lewinsky in the days leading to the case against President Clinton. The probe will address a wide range of questions: Were Enron's partnerships with shell corporations designed to hide its liabilities and mislead investors? Was evidence intentionally or negligently destroyed? Did Enron executives' political contributions and the access that the contributions won them result in any special favors? Did Enron executives know the company was sinking as they sold $1.1 billion in stock while encouraging employees and other investors to keep buying? 
"It's not hard to come up with a scenario for indictment here," says John Coffee, professor of corporate law at Columbia University. "Enough of the facts are already known to know that there is a high prospect of securities-fraud charges against both Enron and some of its officers." He adds that "once you've set up a task force this large, involving attorneys from Washington, New York and probably California, history shows the likelihood is they will find something indictable." 
Enron has already acknowledged that it overstated its income for more than four years. The question is whether this was the result of negligence or an intent to defraud. Securities fraud requires a willful intent to deceive. It doesn't look good, Coffee says, that key Enron executives were selling stock shortly before the company announced a restatement of earnings. 
As for Arthur Andersen, criminal charges could result if it can be shown that its executives ordered the destruction of documents while being aware of the existence of a subpoena for them. A likely ploy will be for prosecutors to target the auditors, hoping to turn them into witnesses against Enron. Says Coffee: "If the auditors can offer testimony, that would be the most damaging testimony imaginable." 
WHAT ABOUT OTHER PROBES? 
Enron is in the cross hairs of at least six congressional panels. In the Senate, the Permanent Investigative Subcommittee got a jump on Jan. 11 by subpoenaing documents of 49 Enron executives and, separately, the corporate records of Enron and Arthur Andersen. The subpoenas, covering the period from 1999 through 2001, are aimed at learning "what the officers knew and what they did about it," said a committee official. The first hearing this year is scheduled for Jan. 24, headed by Connecticut Democrat Joe Lieberman. The first appearance of Enron chairman Lay is scheduled for Feb. 4 before the Senate Commerce Committee. 
There are now 47 class actions against Enron and its executives and directors, filed either by shareholders or employees and carrying mainly the possible penalty of heavy fines. Most allege that Enron failed to disclose its many risky partnerships, which proved to be a large part of its undoing. Though Enron is bankrupt, Arthur Andersen could be liable as well, and Enron's officers and directors have deep pockets. Plaintiffs are seeking to freeze the proceeds of Enron stock sales by those insiders. "Going after directors personally is rare. But this case calls for the unusual," says Jim Newman, executive director of Securities Class Action Services, which monitors such cases. 
WERE FAVORS RECEIVED? 
At the White House last week junior aides were asking Washington veterans whether they will have to hire lawyers because they attended meetings in which Enron issues were discussed. Answer: probably not-- but the question shows the level of concern. Though there has been no evidence of anything illegal, Enron enjoyed considerable influence from the start of the Bush Administration. Curtis Hebert Jr., the former chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, told the New York Times that Lay offered to support Hebert's continuing in that role if Hebert would take a friendlier view toward energy deregulation. Hebert declined, and the Bush Administration replaced him. Lay and other Enron officials met six times with officials led by Vice President Dick Cheney (a former oilman) to craft a new energy policy. That policy, not surprisingly, was friendly to Enron and other energy companies. 
Bush says he first learned last Thursday that Lay had approached his Cabinet secretaries for help. Press secretary Ari Fleischer told Bush he should expect to be asked about any contacts that he had with Lay. Fleischer had researched the matter, and he "refreshed" the President's memory about the last time he met with Lay: in spring 2001, in Houston, at an event hosted by Bush's mother. O'Neill was present at the Thursday discussion and said, "Oh, by the way, you need to know that I had a conversation with Ken Lay. He called me." O'Neill described the call as a "heads up" about Enron's financial woes and the potential effects they might have on the larger economy. Bush nodded. Then Evans, also present, chimed in. "I got a call from Ken too," said the Commerce Secretary, who is Bush's closest friend. "He was asking me to help, but I didn't." 
While Bush and the Republicans have gained the lion's share of attention from Enron and Lay, they get at least a little cover from the company's campaign contributions to prominent Democrats, such as Senate Energy Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman and Louisiana Senator John Breaux. Enron and its top officials have hired the well-known Democratic lawyers Robert Bennett and David Boies. And Bob Rubin, the Democrats' high priest of economics and finance, was caught fishing-- albeit tentatively by all accounts--for Treasury intervention on Enron's behalf. 
WHO WILL AUDIT THE AUDITORS? 
Mark Cheffers, CEO of Accounting Malpractice.com, says of Arthur Andersen: "Even if they're innocent, it looks like a massive cover- up." Andersen reported its destruction of Enron documents to the SEC and Justice Department early last week--just before four congressional investigators arrived at the company's Houston office on Wednesday. Committee officials immediately demanded the personal records of the partner and five top executives working on the Enron account. 
The incident further tars the name of venerable Arthur Andersen, which in June settled allegations of fraud stemming from its audit of Houston-based Waste Management and paid a $7 million fine without admitting any wrongdoing. Last year, again without admitting wrongdoing, Andersen agreed to pay $110 million to settle a class action brought on behalf of shareholders of another client, Sunbeam, which had misstated its financial results during the 1990s. These days, an Andersen competitor observes sardonically, settling a fraud case appears to be good for attracting business from other firms that want a soft touch for an auditor. 
With the SEC, the Justice Department and various congressional committees now scrutinizing Andersen's audit work on Enron, there is little doubt efforts will be made to rein in the industry. "The profession has always done just enough to get out of a hole," says industry analyst Arthur Bowman. The SEC and Congress are looking into Andersen's interpretation of accounting rules that allowed Enron to exclude losses at several partnerships from its balance sheets. But the larger issue will be the objectivity of the entire industry. Enron paid Andersen $25 million for its audit last year and $27 million for "consulting" and other services. "How can any auditor be independent when his client is paying this kind of money?" Bowman asks. 
Two of Enron's senior financial executives had previously worked for Andersen in Houston: Richard Causey, Enron's chief accounting officer, and Jeffrey McMahon, chief financial officer. Although it's not unusual for auditors to be subsequently hired by their clients, Andersen has an unusual history--in Waste Management's case, supplying every CFO from 1971 to 1997. 
CAN 401(K)S BE PROTECTED? 
There has been some movement in Congress for reform, spurred by the plight of Enron workers who had, on average, 62% of their 401(k) savings tied up in Enron stock. Those savings were largely wiped out because the plan offered little opportunity to diversify. Like many corporate plans, Enron's didn't allow participants to transfer stock that had been given to them as part of a matching contribution until age 50. And Enron officials actively encouraged workers to buy Enron stock. In a memo in August, Lay told employees he'd "never felt better about the prospects of the company. Our growth has never been more certain." Enron workers were further hamstrung by Enron's switching of plan administrators and freezing of all asset shifting within 401(k) accounts for at least 10 days, just as Enron stock was taking its dive. The result was ruin, as Enron sank from $90 to under $1. 
Democratic Senators Barbara Boxer of California and Jon Corzine of New Jersey have proposed that plan assets be limited to no more than 20% of any one stock. Their bill would also reduce tax breaks for companies that make matching contributions with stock and would free employees to sell matching stock after 90 days. Senator Bingaman wants to allow companies to offer financial advice without being liable for investment losses, as they currently are. 
Says David Certner, chief lobbyist for the American Association for Retired Persons: "In 401(k) plans, we are asking people to take the risk and responsibility for investing, yet we set up this system where we are violating the first basic rule of investing: diversification." Where company stock is a savings option, employees invest almost a third of their assets in it. 
Behind all the front-page headlines last week, Enron was struggling to manage its bankruptcy reorganization. One key all along has been to keep the vaunted energy-trading unit operating. That group accounted for 90% of Enron's revenue, and Friday it was sold at auction to UBS Warburg for a price to be disclosed this week. The courts must approve the sale, however, which promises to spark legal fireworks from creditors, who will want to make sure the company got a fair price. Not that it will matter much to Enron. The company has little chance of emerging from Chapter 11 intact. Says Peter Chapman, president of Bankruptcy Creditors' Service: "Assets are being liquidated for the benefit of creditors." But even if the company disappears, the name Enron will be with us for a while.

THE NATION THE ENRON INQUIRY As Questions Get Louder, Cheney Stays Silent Politics: Critics want details on meetings with Enron over energy policy. He asserts executive privilege.

WASHINGTON -- The growing Enron debacle is turning up the political heat on Vice President Dick Cheney, who has refused to detail his contacts with company officials while developing a national energy policy last year. 
Amid Democratic charges that he granted Enron undue access--and produced in secret an industry-friendly plan--Cheney's unyielding stance has hampered the Bush administration's efforts to distance itself from the scandal.
The flap dominated Thursday's White House briefing, as it had on Wednesday. Press Secretary Ari Fleischer reiterated Cheney's position: that he is defending executive privilege in rebuffing the congressional push, led by Reps. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) and John D. Dingell (D-Mich.), for the information on his meetings with Enron officials. 
Cheney and his aides say neither he nor his energy task force did anything wrong. Yet the impression lingers, even some Republicans conceded, that the vice president has something to hide. 
"Cheney and his staff have violated the most fundamental of all scandal rules: full and fast disclosure," said Larry J. Sabato, a University of Virginia political scientist. "A flat refusal to disclose information automatically makes the public and the press more suspicious, and it guarantees that the headlines about the controversy will be plentiful and unending." 
Many analysts predict that Cheney ultimately will have little alternative but to provide the information. 
Mary Matalin, a senior Cheney advisor, rejected that scenario. She said in an interview that Cheney will not abandon his conviction that he is acting to protect executive privilege. 
"There is a principle here that we want to preserve--for not just this administration but future administrations," Matalin said. "The powers and prerogatives of the executive branch have been eroded, and we're going to stop that." 
In resisting disclosure, however, Cheney and his aides are providing Democrats and other critics the opportunity to depict the White House as a shill for Enron, the nation's seventh-largest company until it filed for bankruptcy. 
"It may be a matter of principle, but they are going to get killed for it," said Charles E. Cook, a Washington-based political analyst. "They are going to lose a lot of blood and, in the end, they will release" the requested information. 
Cook added: "The question is, how much political pain they are going to sustain before releasing it." 
"The danger for Cheney in this Enron fiasco is perception," added one top Republican strategist, who requested anonymity. "And perception in politics needs to be nipped in the bud--immediately. Right now, they are behind the perception eight-ball." 
Many Republicans and White House allies reject that view--reflecting a vigorous debate that sources say is raging in the West Wing on whether Cheney should turn over the information sought by Congress. 
"My advice to him would be to hang in there. Hang tough. I don't think he's hurting himself," said Washington lobbyist Tom Korologos, who has advised GOP presidents going back to Richard Nixon. 
Another factor that has helped thrust Cheney into the glare of the Enron controversy is the trust and confidence he enjoys from President Bush. 
"The problem with being as visibly influential as Cheney has been is that when things go wrong, he gets some of the blame," said Joel K. Goldstein, a St. Louis University law professor and author of "The Modern American Vice Presidency." 
In the eyes of their political detractors, including environmental activists, Bush and Cheney were suspect on energy issues from their first day in office, given their background in the oil industry. 
Cheney quickly fueled such concerns when, amid sharply rising energy prices, he seemed to discount the importance of conservation in dealing with the problem. Then his energy task force released a plan in May that angered environmentalists and conservationists by proposing, among other things, opening a small portion of Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to energy exploration. 
Critics also immediately questioned the role of Enron executives in the plan's formulation; Waxman and Dingell have been asking Cheney for months to disclose his contacts with the company. With Enron's collapse late last year, those requests have escalated. 
On Wednesday, Democrats on the House Government Reform Committee charged that there are at least 17 policies in the White House energy plan that are "virtually identical to positions Enron advocated." 
Administration officials took strong issue with that assertion. Matalin called it "transparent election-year politicking." 
Such unabated exchanges, however, point up the controversy's corrosive effect on the White House and on Bush's agenda. 
"The big loser last week was the president's education bill," said a senior GOP strategist, noting that news coverage of the measure's signing was overshadowed by the media's focus on the Enron story. 
"Mary Matalin can be flippant all she wants, but this isn't going to go away," said the Republican, who requested anonymity. 
Sabato agreed. 
"Even at this late stage, Cheney's best route out of the controversy is the same as the original one early on--full disclosure," he said. 
"There is something about the White House that leads each new administration to believe they are exempt from the usual rules of scandal," Sabato added. "Perhaps the headiness of power and popularity produces a kind of scandal amnesia. Cheney exhibits the symptoms."

POLITICS
The Mirror Image of Whitewater
William Schneider

01/19/2002
National Journal
Copyright 2002 by National Journal Group Inc. All rights reserved.

Missing documents. Financial wrongdoing. Is Enron another Whitewater? Actually, Enron Corp. looks like the mirror image of Whitewater: a scandal less likely to implicate a President, but more likely to affect public policy. 
Whitewater was about finding a smoking gun that would incriminate President Clinton or his wife. Everyone knew what then-Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., was getting at when he asked, at the outset of the 1994 Whitewater investigation, "What did the President know, and when did he know it?" In the Enron case, no one is making criminal allegations about President Bush. This time, a Senator from the opposition party is again chairing the Senate investigation. But Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., set a different tone when he said, "There are some interconnections here with the Bush Administration, but that's not the focus of this inquiry."
Whitewater was a shady land deal of no great public consequence. The collapse of Enron, the seventh-largest Fortune 500 corporation, matters a great deal. It wiped out $60 billion in shareholder value. Tens of thousands of people got hurt. 
"The grave consequences of Enron's collapse are economic and personal, not political," Lieberman said. Unlike Whitewater, which was intensely political, it's hard to dispute that the Enron investigation concerns a matter of legitimate public interest. As Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., observed, "Either laws and regulations were followed, in which case those laws and regulations are pitifully inadequate.... [or] laws and regulations were violated." 
Enron's well-connected executives and directors may have defrauded investors by concealing information about the company's finances. And these officials may have engaged in insider trading by selling more than $1 billion worth of stock before its price collapsed. 
Enron virtually financed Bush's political career. The company had ties to high-level officials in the Bush White House. And Enron was a major contributor to both political parties. None of that is illegal. But it does raise serious issues. For instance, Enron clearly tried to influence the Bush Administration's energy policy in its favor. Enron representatives met with Vice President Cheney's energy task force six times. Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay pushed, successfully, to replace the head of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Clearly, Enron had special access. Were special favors granted? 
The White House has acknowledged that Lay sought help from top Cabinet and Treasury Department officials as the company struggled to avert bankruptcy. Administration officials say they refused to intervene. Bush's supporters say that Enron's collapse is proof that the company got no special protection. "It's a tribute to our capitalism," Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., said. "Capitalism is the freedom to succeed and the freedom to fail and not have a government guarantee of success." 
But the issue is not merely whether the government attempted to protect the company. It's also whether the government protected the public. Rep. Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif., has said: "It is now clear that the White House had knowledge that Enron was likely to collapse but did nothing to try to protect innocent employees and shareholders who ultimately lost their life savings." 
What is not clear is how much and how early the Bush Administration knew about Enron's problems. "I have never discussed with Mr. Lay the financial problems of the company," Bush said last week. Moreover, the calls from Enron seeking help came in late October, after the company's financial problems had become public. 
It is also unclear what the Administration could have done. Companies fail all the time. Professional auditors and Wall Street analysts didn't raise any alarms about Enron's finances. 
What's driving the political story is the fact that the Administration is behaving so defensively. Why was the White House so reluctant to divulge the records of its energy task force? Why was the Administration so slow to acknowledge contacts between Enron executives and Cabinet officials? In the Enron case, the revelations themselves have not been particularly damaging to the Administration. But the fact the Administration has been so secretive about them raises suspicions of a cover-up. 
So far, the main damage has been to Bush's image. The President may have behaved properly, but the company that has been the chief backer of his political career is now under criminal investigation. There is no way that can look good. 
Enron reinforces a damaging stereotype about Bush, just as Whitewater did about Clinton. Americans had doubts about Bill Clinton's character from the outset. Whitewater brought those problems into focus: Is the President a liar? Americans also started out with a stereotype about George W. Bush: He was a man of limited intellectual ability who raised a lot of money from his rich friends. Enron brings those problems into focus: Is this President a front man for the Big Money boys? 
That image is especially damaging when you have a Republican President born to wealth and privilege in office during an economic downturn. Bush's war leadership can counteract that stereotype-for a time. But which will last longest-the war, the recession, or the Enron controversy? If it turns out to be the recession and the Enron controversy, that combination could be politically lethal.

Gramms regulated Enron, benefited from ties

The collapse of Enron Corp. has drawn new scrutiny of a powerful Washington couple who between them played prominent roles in deregulating energy trading to the benefit of the company. 
The couple, U.S. Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas) and his wife, Wendy Gramm, who serves on Enron's board of directors, both know Enron's top executive, Kenneth Lay--and have benefited financially from their relationship with him.
Phil Gramm has collected more than $97,000 in campaign contributions from Enron, according to the advocacy group Public Citizen. Wendy Gramm was paid between $915,000 and $1.8 million in salary, attendance fees, stock options and dividends over the past eight years, the group concluded. 
"What has all of this bought" Enron, asked Sheila Krumholz, research director for the Center for Responsive Politics. "Has this bought them cover?" 
In the early 1990s, Wendy Gramm, then chairwoman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, moved to lift governmental oversight of energy contracts that Enron and other companies traded. A short time later, she was appointed to Enron's board of directors. 
And in December 2000, Phil Gramm helped clear the way for a bill turning his wife's deregulation decision into law, something Enron had long wanted. 
The Commodity Futures Modernization Act, of which Phil Gramm was a sponsor, contained a clause making the exemption law. Though it is now called the "Enron exemption" on Capitol Hill, a Gramm aide said the senator had not prepared that section of the bill. 
"We were not involved with that part of it," said Larry Neal. Neither Wendy Gramm nor Phil Gramm could be reached for comment Thursday. 
Wendy Gramm's role at Enron has drawn congressional attention in the wake of the Enron collapse. She was among those subpoenaed last week by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, headed by Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.). 
Move to Enron's board 
Although her husband is far better known, Wendy Gramm earned a place of power for herself in Washington. In 1988 she was appointed chairwoman of the trading commission by President Ronald Reagan. The commission at the time regulated futures trading in electricity, a business Enron hoped to dominate. 
Shortly after President Bill Clinton took office in 1993, and Gramm was set to lose her chairmanship, she pushed through a rule deregulating the trading of energy contracts. Enron had been lobbying for exemption from regulation for months. 
Six days later she resigned. Five weeks later she was on the board at Enron. 
Wendy Gramm served on the audit committee of the board, meaning she was one of the directors responsible for Enron's financial reporting to investors. 
Beginning in the late 1990s, Enron executives hid hundreds of millions of dollars in debt in supposedly unrelated partnerships. The result was to make Enron appear much stronger financially than it actually was. 
When word of the partnerships surfaced and Enron acknowledged its debt last year, the company's stock price collapsed and it filed for bankruptcy. 
The members of the audit committee were to oversee the partnerships, according to a report by Enron's law firm, Vinson & Elkins. 
That means the partnerships were not merely a misstep by a lower- level executive but rather were supposed to be known to Wendy Graham and the top leaders of Enron. 
"The audit committee knew of and approved of those partnerships," said Tyson Slocum, research director of Public Citizen's energy program. 
Wendy Gramm has known Lay for years. 
Both were considered possible candidates for Cabinet posts in the Reagan administration. 
"Dr. Gramm's experience in financial and commodities markets will prove extremely valuable to Enron," Lay said in announcing her appointment to the board of directors. Wendy Gramm has a doctorate in economics. 
Role in senator's campaign 
At the time, Lay and Wendy Gramm said her decision favoring Enron played no role in the company's decision to hire her. Lay said it was "convoluted" to question the propriety of naming her to the board. 
While federal regulations prohibited Wendy Gramm from lobbying the trade commission for a time after she left it, no law prohibited her from working for a company she once regulated. 
Lay, for his part, involved himself in Phil Gramm's career. 
Besides contributing money to the senator, Lay served as the regional chairman of Gramm's unsuccessful campaign for the Republican presidential nomination in 1996. 
Wendy Gramm notified Enron in December 1998 that congressional ethics rules might prevent her family from holding stock in Enron, according to Public Citizen. Phil Gramm was preparing legislation that would affect the company, triggering the rules. 
Enron then devised a way to compensate Wendy Gramm, while getting around the problems associated with her ownership of stock in the company, according to Public Citizen. 
"Enron canceled all of her outstanding shares and provided her with an additional service fee for a total of $117,000" over the next four years, the group said.

Bush In The Glare The Enron mess may revive a tough question: Whose side is this President on?

It was supposed to be a week in which George Bush made common cause with the common man, a week of speeches and photo ops to show that the President who whipped the Taliban could also save our jobs and fix our schools. But when a gust of news blew the Enron mess from the business section to the front page, the country saw a tense, cautious President trying his best to distance himself from one of his biggest campaign contributors, the friend he used to call "Kenny Boy." In the Oval Office on Thursday, Bush told reporters he hadn't seen "Mr. Lay" since last spring. 
So far, there is no evidence that anyone in the Administration did anything wrong or that the half a million dollars that Lay and his fellow Enron executives invested in Bush's political career over the years bought them any special favors. But Bush knows he stands in the line of fire. Democrats have been unable to hang the recession on him, but many hope that Enron's hapless employees--whose retirement nest eggs vaporized even as their bosses were selling off more than $1 billion of their own stock--become the image that sticks. The Enron debacle goes to one of the most basic questions Americans ask about their President: Whose side is he on? Pre-September surveys showed a hardening perception that Bush doesn't care about the concerns of the average person. In a New York Times poll last June, 57% of those surveyed said the Administration's policies favored the rich, and 63% said Bush was a "typical Republican." Though his public approval soared after Sept. 11, White House officials fear Bush has not entirely shaken the idea that he cares more about corporations than about the people who work for them. Kenny Boy reminds folks of that.
The Enron mess has reawakened Washington's instant scandal culture, with the entirely predictable twist that Democrats and Republicans have exchanged their well-practiced roles. But there's one obvious comparison that Bush's advisers are at great pains to deny. "There is no war room, no task force, no team of lawyers working day and night to battle the Democrats," says an aide. "This is not the Clinton White House." The Administration finally disclosed last week how many meetings Enron representatives had last year with Vice President Dick Cheney or his staff--six, including one as late as October, when Enron was going down the tubes, although those officials say they never discussed its fortunes. But the Administration continues to fight General Accounting Office efforts to find out who else Cheney talked to when he was developing his energy plan. A GAO lawyer told TIME the agency is hiring attorneys "with Supreme Court experience" in the event that it proceeds with a federal lawsuit to force Cheney to divulge the material. 
Bush was not above a little Clintonesque shading of the truth last Thursday as he described his relationship with Lay. "He was a supporter of [Democratic incumbent Governor] Ann Richards in my run in 1994," said the President, adding that he got to know Lay after that. This came as a surprise to a great many people in Texas, as Lay and his wife contributed $47,500 to Bush's campaign that year (and a mere $12,500 to Richards') and Enron's political-action committee and executives donated nearly $100,000 more to Bush, according to the watchdog group Texans for Public Justice. Lay had even contributed to Bush's unsuccessful race for Congress in 1978. 
Amid all their self-congratulatory talk about being forthcoming-- getting "in front of the story," as it's known in Washington--Bush officials insist they see nothing odd about the idea that it took nearly three months for Commerce Secretary Don Evans and Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill to inform the White House that Lay had come to them seeking help as the company was going under. If the White House's story is so clean--Enron asked; we said no--why wait three months to tell it? 
Last week news of the calls to Evans and O'Neill kicked the Democrats into high gear, targeting Bush as an enemy of the little guy. The White House, said Democratic Congressman Henry Waxman, "had knowledge that Enron was likely to collapse but did nothing to try to protect innocent employees and shareholders, who ultimately lost their life savings." And it's not just the Waxmans of the world that Bush has to worry about. Louisiana Republican Billy Tauzin, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, the first to announce a formal congressional probe, has already sent investigators to the Houston offices of both Enron and its accounting firm, Arthur Andersen. 
No wonder Bush tried to change the subject last week. He spoke of fixing the 401(k) pension laws and regulations that let Enron's bankruptcy become a personal tragedy for its workers. Bush's first challenge is to convince Americans that he didn't use his influence to protect one of his biggest campaign contributors. His larger one is to convince them he will use that influence from now on to protect them from future corporate shell games. --With reporting by James Carney and Adam Zagorin

The administration of George W. Bush came under sudden siege in the wake of the December collapse of Enron Corp., a secretive energy- trading firm and America's seventh-largest company. As the justice department started a criminal probe and five congressional committees announced hearings, ex-oilman Bush tried to distance his administration from revelations that Vice-President Dick Cheney and other officials had numerous meetings with Enron on energy policy and the possibility of a credit extension. Enron was Bush's biggest campaign contributor. Enron's auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, also admitted that its people had destroyed significant numbers of Enron documents. The company went bankrupt when a potential merger partner walked away after taking a close look at Enron's notoriously obscure financial numbers. A handful of top executives sold about $1 billion (U.S.) of company stock before the price collapsed. At the same time, thousands of employees were barred from selling their shares and lost savings and retirement accounts.

Late to the Party

Enron World, the media amusement park, has been packed lately, as everyone tries out all the fantastic rides and games. The lines have been especially long at Who's to Blame?-a funhouse where laughing journalists race around pointing fingers in all directions and throwing pies at the Enron players of their choice. 
The New York Times won a plush teddy bear for hitting 15 different Enron clown-figures-including Dick Cheney, Larry Lindsey, Marc Racicot, Karl Rove, and Texas Gov. Rick Perry-with one 785-word shot, all names in bold. And Time magazine hasn't missed out on the thrills: "Huge questions loom as to how widespread the damage will be, who is to blame, and what is going to be done about it.... John Dingell, ranking member of the House Energy [and Commerce] Committee, said it best: `Where was the SEC? Where was the Financial Accounting Standards Board? Where was Enron's audit committee? Where were the accountants? Where were the lawyers? Where were the investment bankers? Where were the analysts? Where was common sense?' "
Dingell's list of culprits had one notable omission. But he probably didn't want to spoil the fun by asking the question that floats over the Enron story like a big, silent blimp: Where were the journalists? 
We are talking, after all, about a huge public corporation, one that was required by law to release reams of data about itself on a regular basis. While top Enron executives appear to have worked hard to conceal the company's true financial condition, the public record has long contained hints of trouble. They were exactly the kinds of hints that journalists are supposed to be good at noticing: numbers that didn't quite add up, vague references to odd-sounding business arrangements. But in order to see them, you had to be looking hard. To get at their meaning, you had to be willing to dig. 
In early November, with Enron's slide well under way, The Wall Street Journal published a story about a New York money manager named James Chanos. It appeared in a Heard on the Street column by Cassell Bryan-Low and Suzanne McGee, and though it has since been recycled here and there in other outlets, the story is not broadly known. As the scandal grows larger by the day, and journalists glory in its delights, it's worth taking a quick look back at Chanos. His story should be a stunning rebuke to the media, for it suggests we could have had the Enron story long ago, if only we had wanted it. 
When Enron's annual report came out in the fall of 2000, Chanos went through it carefully, The Journal reported, "underlining complicated passages and scribbling exclamation points and question marks." One curious section caught his eye. It said a top Enron executive was the "managing member" of a "private investment company" called LJM Cayman. This company had "entered into a series of transactions" with Enron, transactions that the report briefly and murkily described. 
Chanos didn't understand what this meant, but he thought it was interesting. So he did more homework in the public record. "Over time, he would build up an 18-inch stack of regulatory filings and other material about Enron," the paper reported. He also hit the phones, quizzing expert Enron-watchers about the company's operations and health. In the end, Chanos concluded that Enron was a "hedge fund in disguise"-a very risky enterprise in which he didn't believe it was wise to own stock. 
Now Chanos was not doing all this legwork out of high- minded intellectual curiosity or in the interest of the public good. He is well-known in investment circles as a "short-seller," one who makes money by identifying weak companies and betting that their stocks will decline. But when he was poring over all those documents, calling people and begging for information, trying to drag the truth out of a stonewalling organization, Chanos was behaving an awful lot like a reporter. (Indeed, when another short-seller made a stink about Enron's refusal to release a balance sheet, the CEO cussed him out, using the same word that George W. Bush once applied to a pesky New York Times reporter.) 
In one sense, it's kind of stunning that some ambitious business journalist didn't do exactly what Chanos did, then write up a big splash about Enron's coming demise. The word "Cayman" alone should have rung bells for anyone who has covered financial shenanigans. 
But in another sense, the media's Enron failure isn't surprising at all. The democratization of Wall Street has given most Americans a huge stake in the stock market. Millions of middle-class families have their college and retirement savings- their futures-riding on the health of public companies such as Enron. Yet most American media companies haven't recognized that they have a gigantic opportunity, and arguably a duty, to cover these companies with the same sort of hard-core accountability journalism they apply to government. 
The fault doesn't really lie with individual reporters. Just digging up the information for routine business stories is hard work, mainly because business people have little incentive to help the media. Daily beat reporters can't be expected to be crusading investigators, too: All their sources would dry up. But if every American news outlet would send its investigative aces- the types who love political dirt-out into corporate America for a few years, I bet they'd find a lot more Enrons. And prevent a lot more ruin. 
"There's much to learn when a stock loses $67 billion in value," observes Money magazine in the headline over an Enron story. There sure is.

McKinsey Held Close Enron Ties For Many Years
By Suein Hwang and Rachel Emma Silverman
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

Back in the heady days of October 2000, at a sumptuous hotel ballroom in Palm Beach, the finance committee of Enron Corp.'s board heard then-Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow describe Enron's need for outside private partnerships to help drive the company's explosive growth -- partnerships that would sow the seeds of Enron's current woes. 
According to internal company documents, one outsider also attended that meeting: Richard N. Foster, a senior partner with McKinsey & Co. 
Mr. Foster was an advisor to Enron's board between October 2000 and October 2001 and attended about six board meetings, according to a McKinsey spokesman. Indeed, the celebrated consulting firm was a major force at Enron almost from the company's birth in the mid-'80s. McKinsey was where former Enron CEO Jeff Skilling worked before jumping to Enron, and McKinsey was instrumental in advising Enron during its decade-long transformation from a natural-gas-pipeline company into a massively complex trading operation with far-flung interests in water, timber, and high-speed Internet. McKinsey typically stationed its own personnel at Enron's offices, and dispatched about five to 15 consultants to the Houston headquarters to advise on strategy and operations, according to former Enron executives.
At a time when Enron's collapse is churning up thorny ethical and legal problems for its accountants, lawyers and executives, the question arises: How accountable should McKinsey, its strategy advisor, be? Though courts generally haven't found consultants liable for their advice, McKinsey's long and close relationship to Enron inevitably raises questions about how much the company knew about financial irregularities that only surfaced last summer. 
A McKinsey spokesman said: "In serving Enron, McKinsey was not retained to provide advice to Enron or any Enron-affiliated entity with respect to the company's financial reporting strategy, methods of financing, methods of disclosure, investment partnerships or off-balance-sheet financing vehicles." 
In exchange for its strategic advice to Enron, McKinsey received millions of dollars in consulting fees. When Enron's stock began to soar, the consulting firm made the Enron success story a cornerstone of the management gospel it preaches in part to woo other clients. 
In an article published in the March 22, 1997, edition of its academic publication, McKinsey Quarterly, the authors celebrated Enron's "new breed of tightly focused and vertically specialized `petropreneurs.'" Later in that same article, Mc-Kinsey writers extolled how Enron had created a trading, finance and risk management business worth more than $250 million in five years, and how "its deployment of off-balance-sheet funds using institutional investment money fostered its securitization skills and granted it access to capital at below the hurdle rates of major oil companies." 
Though such writings suggest McKinsey knew about Enron's extensive use of off-balance sheet funds, there is no indication that anyone at the consulting firm knew fully how Enron was using those partnerships. Late last year, Enron had to restate four years of earnings because of improper accounting for some of those entities. 
A McKinsey spokesman said it was a 75-year old policy of the firm not to comment specifically on client matters. 
Enron also played a featured role in McKinsey-partner Mr. Foster's recent book "Creative Destruction," published last year. "How do the concepts of control, permission and risk fit together?" asked authors Mr. Foster and Sarah Kaplan, a former McKinsey employee. "Enron offers one good example of managing these elements to a favorable outcome." 
Speaking on behalf of Mr Foster, a McKinsey spokesman said "the main thesis of Creative Destruction is that in the long run markets outperform companies because companies have not yet found a way to change at the pace and scale of the markets without losing control." Enron didn't return calls seeking comment about Mc-Kinsey's relationship with Enron. 
McKinsey has seen rocky times of late. The slowing economy has impacted the firm, forcing McKinsey to trim its work force last year. McKinsey was embroiled in a public display of finger-pointing with a Chinese computer firm last year, and the firm parted ways with Swissair after an ambitious plan it devised was blamed for the airline's collapse. McKinsey declined to comment on those relationships as well. 
Enron could represent more than just an embarrassing client for McKinsey. Its plunge into bankruptcy has sparked numerous investigations, as congressional leaders and others search to understand what drove its collapse, which jolted financial markets and left thousands of its current and former employees with little or no retirement savings. McKinsey says it has not been contacted by government investigators regarding Enron. 
Though there is no indication that McKinsey may itself become a subject of investigation, it could be caught up as a third party in the investigation of its client. Legal experts say McKinsey, unlike Enron's lawyers and accountants, has no privilege of confidentiality that would shield it from disclosing information to government investigators. 
For decades, McKinsey has been revered -- even feared -- for its influence in boardrooms and its extensive and powerful old-boy network among major corporations. Its alumni list reads like a who's who of the Fortune 500, including the likes of IBM Corp. Chief Executive Lou Gerstner. In recent years, that network has helped privately held McKinsey win lucrative consulting contracts from companies run by its former partners. 
Mr. Skilling, a vital bridge between McKinsey and Enron, described McKinsey's approach in an interview with this newspaper in 1993, three years after joining Enron: "In the old days, we'd do one project and go away," he said of his days at McKinsey. But over time, "the relationships got closer and bigger." 
McKinsey was central to Enron's "asset-light" strategy, the notion of building an industrial powerhouse with few hard assets; McKinsey also advised Enron as it considered entering new businesses, according to former Enron executives. In one McKinsey Quarterly article in 1999, the consultants praised Enron's water-industry investment, "despite a lack of obvious linkages to energy," they wrote, "as a chance to leverage intangibles such as project management, network operations, and infrastructure development skills." The water foray ended in disaster last October, when Enron took a $287 million write-off to exit the business. 
One former executive who developed and managed power projects said he was ordered to check with McKinsey when he wanted to make an arcane type of gas-transmission investment. A team of McKinsey experts was sent to Enron's offices to check out the deal. "They were all over the place," he says. 
Suggestions that McKinsey was a "decision maker or a necessary review body on Enron's asset investments are flat-out wrong," McKinsey says.

Enron Creditors Group Law Firm Has Ties To Co, Creditors
By Kathy Chu

01/18/2002
Dow Jones News Service

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
(This report was first published late Thursday.) 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- It seems difficult to find a company that doesn't have ties to bankrupt Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) these days.
Take, for instance, Milbank Tweed Hadley & McCloy LLP, the New York law firm representing the official creditors committee in Enron's Chapter 11 proceedings. 
Milbank Tweed served as counsel to the bankrupt company in unrelated legal matters for at least the past five years - receiving $5.67 million from Enron, or about 1.5% of its more than $350 million in revenue last year - and has ties to hundreds of Enron's creditors and interested parties. The firm, which still must get the bankruptcy court's official approval, also represents Citigroup Inc. (C) and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (JPM), Enron's largest lenders, in matters "unrelated" to Enron's bankruptcy proceedings, according to court documents. 
The disclosure - made in 137 pages of documents filed late Wednesday with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York - is another sign of the pervasive reach of the once-mighty energy-trading company. 
It also reveals the need for deftness by interested parties attempting to sidestep conflicts in the largest bankruptcy case in U.S. history. 
Mary Elizabeth Tom, the assistant U.S. trustee for the Southern District of New York, said that while Milbank Tweed's relationships to Enron and some creditors may be unusual, few things in these complex proceedings are "common." 
"Any law firm would have ties (to Enron)," she said, adding that her office supports Milbank Tweed as counsel to the creditors committee. 
Enron also has no objection to the arrangement, attorney Martin Bienenstock of Weil Gotshal & Manges has said. 
Creditors will get a chance to weigh in at the end of this month, at a bankruptcy hearing before Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez. 
For now, the official creditors committee is considering appointing a special counsel to handle matters from which Milbank Tweed must recuse itself, according to people familiar with the matter. 
Issues that creditors may take a look at include Milbank Tweed's dealings with Enron North America and Enron Broadband Services on investment matters as recently as last November - a few weeks before the company and its units began filing for bankruptcy. 
Also, in addition to J.P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup, which serve on the creditors committee, UBS AG, which plans to take over Enron's core energy-trading operations, is on Milbank Tweed's client roster. 
Milbank Tweed, in the court filing, said it will continue representing these banks, but plans to stay away from any claims in Enron's bankruptcy case by relying on an "information firewall" between its attorneys. 
The law firm - which has no current ties to Enron - also plans to regularly identify all of its connections with debtors and creditors in the bankruptcy case. 
This transparency, according to legal experts, will be key to maintaining the confidence of all involved. 
"The failure to disclose could result in the later disqualification of the firm as counsel," said Jack Williams, the outgoing scholar at the American Bankruptcy Institute, a nonprofit think tank in Alexandria, Va. "There's a major risk that a firm undertakes when they represent a creditors committee." 

Creditors Committee Wants To Move Quickly 

The appointment of Milbank Tweed - a firm versed in complex bankruptcy proceedings and the energy and capital markets - signals the committee's need to move quickly in Enron's bankruptcy case. Attorney Luc Despins, co-chairman of the firm's financial restructuring group, is the lead lawyer for the unsecured creditors group. He couldn't be immediately reached for comment. 
The committee's actions will be pivotal in determining whether Enron is able to reorganize in 12 months, as it hopes. 
One point of favor: Bankruptcy experts say that Milbank Tweed's knowledge of bankruptcy and insolvency law, as well as regulatory and securities issues, will expedite legal proceedings. 
"I don't think boutique firms would have had this expertise," said Williams, of the American Bankruptcy Institute. 
The New York offices of the international law firm beat out more than a dozen rivals for the job - including Thompson & Knight and Coudert Brothers LLP - last month. 
But in order to keep itself in favor with the company and its creditors, the law firm will have to avoid some of its previous missteps. 
Milbank Tweed hit rough waters last year while representing the official creditors group in PG&E Corp.'s (PCG) Pacific Gas & Electric bankruptcy. 
A U.S. trustee in California raised questions about whether Milbank Tweed - as well as other law and accounting firms in the case - had improperly billed for more than $1 million in combined fees during the first four months of the case. 
Late last year, a federal bankruptcy judge rejected some of these fees but upheld others. The judge also firmed up billing guidelines, and advised the companies to stick to them.

excerpts only...
AARON BROWN, NEWSNIGHT CORRESPONDENT: Good evening again from Los Angeles. I'm Aaron Brown. We spent much of today trapped in another time, in the '60s, which in truth were also the first half of the '70s, and the arrests yesterday in the 1975 robbery/murder that was very much front page news out here and around the country today. 
*****
On to Enron we go. Are you seated? This one may shock you. The company fired its accounting firm today, Arthur Andersen, questions about document shredding it seeMs. Enron's lead lawyer, Bob Bennett, adding that "we're very concerned about what the accounting advice was." Those are his words and it is in the running for the understatement of the century, at least so far. It's early. 
Also today, we got word that Enron managed to avoid paying Federal income taxes in four of the last five years. That is not uncommon for big companies with smart accountants. 
There is also a political story to this developing, and for that we turn, once again, to CNN's Tim O'Brien who joins us from Washington. Tim, good evening. 
O'BRIEN: Good evening, Aaron. The ranking Democrat on the House Government Reform Committee, Henry Waxman has just issued a report alleging that 17 policies in President Bush's new energy plan either benefit Enron or were even proposed by Enron, a report the White House angrily dismissed as a waste of the taxpayer's money. 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 
ARI FLEISCHER, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The allegation by Congressman Waxman that anything was put in that plan for political purposes is, of itself, a partisan waste of taxpayer money. 
REPRESENTATIVE HENRY WAXMAN (D) CALIFORNIA: I have made no accusations of any wrongdoing by anybody in the Bush Administration, and I think it would be unfair to do so until we have a thorough investigation and we get all the facts. 
O'BRIEN: The administration, citing separation of powers, has made it clear however Congress won't be given any facts about meetings with Enron officials at the White House. That clash could end up in court, as could the developing clash between Enron and its former accounting firm Arthur Andersen. Congressional investigators have uncovered an e-mail, indicating Andersen decided to retain Enron as a client only after a significant discussion of Enron's earning, which it characterized as "intelligent gambling." 
Enron struck back, firing Arthur Andersen. In an exclusive interview with Lou Dobbs MONEYLINE, the CEO of Arthur Andersen said that was to be expected. 
JOSEPH BERARDINO, CEO, ANDERSEN: Well, Lou, techni
cally and I hate to be technical but I think it is an important point, when a company goes in bankruptcy, all its relationships are severed. 
O'BRIEN: No, that's not it at all, said Enron CEO Kenneth Lay. The Andersen firm was fired because it improperly destroyed documents. And then there's Harvey Pitt, the Chairman of the Securities Exchange Commission, who earlier in the day proposed that accounting firms, like Arthur Andersen, be held more accountable. 
But what's he doing in all this? As a lawyer in private practice, Pitt used to represent Arthur Andersen. Democrats charge conflict of interest. 
HARVEY PITT, CHAIRMAN, SECURITIES EXCHANGE COMMISSION: I will not only adhere to the letter of my ethics obligations. I will adhere to the spirit. 
O'BRIEN: Translation, Pitt will not recuse himself from the case, but he will keep his distance from the investigation. 
(END VIDEOTAPE) 
O'BRIEN (on camera): To many, perhaps most the scandal is and may always be more about business than about politics, unless of course you live in Washington where business and just about everything else is politics. Aaron. 
BROWN: Tim, thank you. Tim O'Brien in Washington on Enron tonight. In a moment, the Symbionese Liberation Army, the ghosts of 1975, and the events that haunt a lot of people today. We'll revisit the SLA's violent demise and talk to a son who remembers the SLA as people who murdered his mother. This is NEWSNIGHT from Los Angeles on a Thursday.

Diversify, Diversify, Diversify
By James K. Glassman

01/18/2002
The Wall Street Journal
A10
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

When shares of Enron plunged from $84 earlier this year to practically zero, thousands of the company's employees lost not just their jobs but also most of the value of their 401(k) retirement accounts. For the average employee, Enron stock represented three-fifths of 401(k) assets, and the energy company's meltdown -- after revelations of misleading, probably fraudulent, accounting practices -- was a personal calamity. 
Now politicians, including Democratic Sens. Barbara Boxer of California and Jon Corzine of New Jersey, are rushing in to protect other Americans from similar disasters. And President Bush has ordered "a policy review to protect people's pensions." But government intervention would only introduce a dangerous idea: that investors shouldn't bear the burden of their own decisions.
Let's be clear: Enron executives and outside auditors who lied to investors -- including their own 21,000 employees -- bear an enormous responsibility, moral and legal. But the employees also bear some responsibility. Most of them had far too large a proportion of their retirement assets tied up in their own company. They took a risk. 
Enron offered a typical 401(k): Employees could invest up to 6% of their base pay in a wide range of options, including stock mutual funds like Fidelity Magellan, bonds, money-market funds and a self-directed Schwab account that could buy practically anything. They could also choose Enron stock, purchased at the regular market price. Whatever employees contributed with their own money, the company matched, up to 50% (that is, 3% of base pay), with Enron stock. 
In other words, free Enron stock -- $1,800 worth a year for an employee making $60,000 in base pay -- was part of the compensation package. Workers knew it, and they presumably liked it. Workers also knew that their 401(k) had a rule, also common to such plans, that they had to keep the company stock given to them by Enron until they were at least 50 years old. Any Enron stock they bought themselves, of course, they could transfer at will. 
Enron stock soared in value -- but turned out to be a blessing and a curse. Imagine the case of an employee who joined the company in 1997, when the stock was worth (after adjusting for splits) about $20 a share. If the employee bought other assets which grew at 10% a year, by the end of 2000 those assets had grown by about one-third while the Enron stock had more than quadrupled. His 401(k) account became lopsided, with far more Enron stock than anything else. 
That was a predicament common to many Enron employees when their company stock crashed. The wise move, as Enron climbed, would have been to buy other assets for a separate, taxable plan to balance the company stock. How many employees did that? Probably not many -- presumably for some because they didn't have the money. If Social Security had been reformed, they could have directed part of their payroll taxes into broad indexes of stocks and bonds, offsetting their Enron holdings. But that's a subject for another day. 
Warren Buffett, the best investor of the last century, is fond of quoting Mae West as saying, "Too much of a good thing can be wonderful." But for most investors, picking the good thing isn't easy. The most important rule, by far, for successful investors is, "Diversify, diversify, diversify." 
As late as October, even the independent Value Line Investment Survey was giving Enron an "A" rating for financial strength and saying the stock had "above-average appreciation potential." If Enron had represented 5% of your portfolio -- the maximum for any stock, as far as I'm concerned -- then its bankruptcy would have put only a small dent in your retirement account. Instead, a study released in November by the Employee Benefit Research Institute and the Investment Company Institute found that company stock represents nearly one-third of the total assets in the 401(k) plans of employees of firms that offer their own stock as an investment option. 
That's far, far too much. Right this second, the 37 million Americans with 401(k) plans should be reviewing them to be sure they're diversified. 
Instead, they're being told by politicians, don't worry, the government will fix everything so you can play the stock market with no downside risk. Ms. Boxer and Mr. Corzine want a law that would prohibit any one stock from representing more than 20% of a 401(k) plan's assets. But all this does is reduce investor choice and responsibility while stepping ever closer toward some kind of federally mandated retirement system. 
The big problem is that too few Americans understand what prudent portfolios are. Current laws don't help. Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, the guiding federal pension statute, overseen by the Labor Department, companies are held liable for investment advice offered to their employees, even if it is given by independent professionals they hire. So most 401(k) participants get no advice at all. They're forced to choose among assets they don't understand. A recent study by John Hancock Financial Services, for example, found that many investors believe that a diversified stock fund is more risky than their company's stock, and that a bond fund is risk-free. 
Last month, the Labor Department issued an opinion at the request of SunAmerica that lightened some of the legal burden and let the investment advisor help employees allocate their assets. More important is the Retirement Security Advice Act, introduced by Rep. John Boehner (R., Ohio), which removes unreasonable employer liability. It's backed by the administration and has passed the House. A similar bill is sponsored in the Senate by Jeff Bingaman (D., N.M.). 
That pension rules are complicated is no excuse for the inaccuracies of the reporting on Enron's retirement plan -- especially the claim that rich managers could sell their stock while lowly workers were "locked in." All plan members, including top executives, were prevented from moving any of their 401(k) assets between Oct. 29 and Nov. 13 -- a temporary shutdown, announced on Oct. 4, supposedly to allow for a transition to a new outside plan administrator. By then Enron's stock had already fallen to $13.81 (it declined another $3.83 during the 10 trading days of the freeze). 
The timing of the changeover does sound a little fishy, and investigators should examine it carefully. But such shutdowns are common, and there's no need to ban them. One small change in the law that might be worthwhile is for companies to be prevented from issuing restricted stock to plan members. Other investors aren't barred from selling stock before they're 50; employees shouldn't be either. 
But let's not lose sight of the main lesson of the Enron disaster: Bad things happen to good investors, and diversification is the only protection. Companies should design plans that make diversification easier, but, ultimately, the responsibility for wise investing must lie with the investor. Politicians who say it doesn't are only encouraging risky behavior.

Breakingviews: J.P. Morgan May Pay for Creativity --- Insurers Challenge Bank's Method for Controlling Risks in Enron Dealings
Edited by Hugo Dixon

01/18/2002
The Wall Street Journal Europe
24
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Why is J.P. Morgan Chase butting heads with a group of insurers in a U.S. court? It may be because of the way the investment bank structured its lending to Enron. J.P. Morgan used highly esoteric structures to neutralize the credit risks it was running. One of these has backfired, possibly leaving the bank with far more credit exposure than it thought. 
The transactions at issue were forward purchases of gas and oil from Enron by a company related to (and financed by) J.P. Morgan. These trades were guaranteed with third-party credit insurers, thus seemingly neutralizing J.P. Morgan's credit exposure. But for this purpose, J.P. Morgan chose not to buy credit derivatives -- instruments that explicitly transfer unsecured credit risk from one party to another -- but surety bonds. These instruments are more commonly used to insure the physical risks involved in corporate transactions. In the case of Enron, such risks might have included pipeline explosions. J.P. Morgan seems to believe that such transactions were in the ordinary course of its energy trading operations. The insurers contend they were disguised loans, and that they hadn't agreed to take unsecured credit risk on Enron. It is hard to tell who is right. But the structure adopted by J.P. Morgan allowed Enron to increase the size of its balance sheet without appearing to take on more debt. 
Indeed, such techniques seem to have allowed it to expand its revenue, giving the bogus appearance of success. These matters are now the subject of a legal dispute. The insurers may yet be obliged to cough up. But J.P. Morgan seems to have tied itself in too many knots trying to service its client. The bank's creativity has already dented its reputation for managing risk by forcing it to increase by $1.7 billion (1.93 billion euros) to $2.6 billion the estimate of its total exposure to Enron. It may also cost its investors dearly.

COMPANIES & FINANCE ENRON COLLAPSE - Duke benefits from traders' flight to quality - RIVAL MERCHANT'S RESULTS.
By SHEILA MCNULTY.

01/18/2002
Financial Times
(c) 2002 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved

Shares in Duke Energy slid more than 6 per cent in New York trading yesterday after the US power group said fourth-quarter earnings dropped 21 per cent because of mild weather and lower power prices. 
Fourth-quarter net income was $225m, down from $284m in the year-ago period. Excluding items, earnings per share were 35 cents, down from 47 cents. Wall Street had been expecting 45 cents, according to Thomson Financial/First Call.
Despite yesterday's share price fall, analysts predicted the fourth-quarter results would be among the best of those to come, as reporting got under way for the energy merchants. 
"Duke is the blue chip: it's the most stable, the financially strongest (and) has the strongest system," said Robin West, chairman of the Petroleum Finance Company, a Washington consultancy. "I think their results will lead the industry." 
Duke was forced to take a $43m provision for non-collateralised exposure to Enron in the quarter. 
Nevertheless, the North Carolina-based company reported a record $2.64 in earnings per share in 2001. Full-year revenue grew 21 per cent to $60bn in 2001 and earnings before interest and taxes increased to $4.3bn. 
Part of the gain was attributed to the "flight to quality" in energy trading following the Enron collapse, as counterparties sought safety in Duke's diversified portfolio and investment-grade credit rating. 
In general, Raymond Niles of Salomon Smith Barney expects year-on-year earnings per share gains for the industry, but sees a greater potential for "downside risk". He pointed to the possibility of lower trading volumes resulting from Enron's fallout and subsequent credit concerns about the industry. He also cited weak power prices, mild weather and the slow economy. 
Several energy companies were forced to take steps in the fourth quarter of 2001 to reassure investors, creditors and rating agencies that they were not vulnerable to the financial problems that pushed Enron, the biggest US energy trader, into bankruptcy on December 2. 
El Paso, Dynegy, Williams and Mirant all outlined restructuring programmes. These included asset sales, reductions in capital spending, restoring off-balance sheet structures to the balance sheet and issuing equity. 
The restructurings, in addition to several factors specific to some individual companies, led Mr Niles to lower his average long-term growth outlook for the energy merchant industry to 10-20 per cent, from 15-25 per cent. 
For power producers such as Calpine - which has also outlined measures to strengthen its balance sheet - Mr Niles belives 2002 may be atransition year, as growth targets are slashed and rationalisation takes hold, reflecting the cyclical nature of the business.

Report on Business: Managing
Enron debacle casting 'lousy' light on accountants
Reuter News Agency

NEW YORK -- Why did the accountant cross the road? The answer used to be to bore people on the other side. In light of the Enron Corp.-Arthur Andersen LLP scandal, it may now be to avoid prosecution. 
Long the butt of jokes as the epitome of boring and unsung professions -- the greyest of the men in the grey flannel suits -- accountants suddenly find themselves at the fore of national news with the heat accounting firm Andersen is taking.
Andersen's role in the Enron debacle has thrust an accountant to the front pages. David Duncan, Andersen's lead partner in charge of reviewing Enron's books, is now enduring the kind of unwanted celebrity usually reserved for the Monica Lewinskys and Gary Condits of the world, after it was revealed he ordered the destruction of Enron documents. 
"None of us want to see our profession cast in this light," said Steven Lilien, chairman of the accounting department at New York's Baruch College. "There's some lousy light being cast on the accountants now." 
Mr. Duncan has said he was following company instructions. 
Also altering the traditional milquetoast image of the accountant is Andersen managing partner and chief executive officer Joseph Berardino, who has been trying to restore the tarnished image of the firm and taken his case to the public. 
Mr. Berardino on Wednesday took out full-page ads in major U.S. newspapers with an open letter to "respond to recent Enron-related events." 
There was a time when the world's most famous accountants were the representatives from Price Waterhouse, annually trotted out during the Academy Awards to acknowledge their part in tallying the Oscar votes. And no one ever knew their names. 
Sensational scandals, shredded documents, the glare of congressional hearings and the possibility of high-profile criminal trials could soon have accountants longing for the anonymity of yore.

The Enron Story That Waited To Be Told
Howard Kurtz
Washington Post Staff Writer

The Washington Post
FINAL
C01
Copyright 2002, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved

Bethany McLean, a 31-year-old Fortune magazine reporter with an impossibly soft voice, decided to take a hard look at Enron last January. 
The Houston energy company didn't like her questions. The CEO, Jeffrey Skilling, called her unethical and hung up on her. The chairman, Kenneth Lay, called Fortune's managing editor to complain. The chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, flew to New York to tell McLean and her editors that Enron was in great shape.
McLean refused to be intimidated. "The company remains largely impenetrable to outsiders," she wrote in Fortune's March 5, 2001, issue. "How exactly does Enron make its money? Details are hard to come by because Enron keeps many of the specifics confidential. . . . Analysts don't seem to have a clue." All this amounted to a "red flag" that "may increase the chance of a nasty surprise." 
The story sank without a trace. "At that point the coverage of Enron was pretty glowing," McLean says. After all, the stock had soared 90 percent the previous year and was selling for $76 a share. 
Now that the company has collapsed amid charges of financial chicanery, devastating its employees' retirement funds, Enron is the hottest story in the country. Political reporters joined the fray after learning that Enron had sought help from the Bush White House. Teams of business journalists are digging into the largest corporate meltdown in American history. 
But as in the savings and loan debacle a dozen years ago, it took news organizations too long to piece together the clues. 
"It's fair to say the press did not do a great job in covering Enron," says Steve Shepard, editor-in-chief of Business Week magazine, which ran only briefs on the company's financial problems until a cover story in November. "Enron was really a systemic failure of all the checks and balances we have on corporate governance: integrity of management, board of directors, audit committee of the board, outside accounting firm, Wall Street analysts and ultimately the press. And all of us failed." 
There were some notable early efforts. Last May, the Wall Street Journal ran a front-page story on Lay getting a half-hour meeting to lobby Vice President Cheney on the administration's energy program. The story noted that over the years Enron had donated nearly $2 million to President Bush, Lay's longtime friend, and that some top administration officials had worked for Enron. 
"I feel pretty good about what we've done on Enron," says Alan Murray, the Journal's Washington bureau chief. "What we clearly did not understand was that it was heading for a disaster." 
The problem, he says, is that such stories often turn on "arcane and technical" practices. "The press doesn't pay as much attention to some of these regulatory issues that have more impact on the world than the political issues we do pay attention to," Murray says. 
If company auditors -- in this case, Arthur Andersen -- don't raise questions, "it's very hard to know where to look," says Larry Kramer, chief executive of CBS MarketWatch.com. "We didn't get a lot of rumblings. Our coverage was robust, but was still based on events after the fact." 
A dramatic decline in stock is not necessarily a warning of foul play, says Kramer, noting that his own company went public at $97 a share and the stock is now worth $4. "People just got dazzled by the size of the business," he says of Enron. 
David Morrow, editor of TheStreet.com, says the press is "too reactionary. It's too easy for the business press to look at what the analysts are saying." Most Wall Street analysts had a buy rating on Enron stock. 
Indeed, only one group wanted Enron's stock to tank: the short-sellers, professional traders who bet on a stock's decline. One short-seller, Jim Chanos of Kynikos Associates, suggested to Fortune's McLean that she look at Enron's Form 10-K, a required annual filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
McLean says she understood Chanos's motive but was struck by the document. There were "strange transactions," "erratic cash flow" and huge debt. "It made you wonder, if their business was so phenomenally profitable, why they had to be adding debt at such a rapid rate," she says. 
But the story was hard to write: "You can't just spout off about derivatives and mark-to-market accounts and expect people to get it." 
Ironically, Fortune's own surveys had named Enron America's most innovative firm for six straight years, and much of the coverage was similarly upbeat. Last January, a Houston Chronicle story was headlined: "Houston has $100 billion company; Enron Corp. sets records for sales, earnings in 2000." 
There were a few critical pieces, but they mainly focused on politics. 
In February, the Los Angeles Times reported on the close ties between Lay and the president, noting that Bush had flown on Enron jets during the campaign. In March, The Washington Post ran a piece on Lay's growing influence. In May, the New York Times quoted the federal government's top electricity regulator, Curtis Hebert Jr., as saying Lay had offered to support his continued tenure if he changed his views on energy deregulation. Hebert says he declined. Bush replaced him months later. 
In August, at a Fortune conference in Aspen, Lay told Rik Kirkland, Fortune's managing editor, that Enron really disliked McLean's story. A week later, Skilling quit as CEO after just six months on the job, calling it a "personal decision." 
"The main point of failure was when Skilling resigned, because unless he had cancer or something it was inexplicable," Business Week's Shepard says. "The failure of the press was not saying, 'What's going on here?' " Business Week talked to Skilling off the record but could shed no further light on the situation. 
To be sure, journalists were skeptical. "The abruptness of the departure left many analysts questioning whether a series of setbacks the company has suffered played a part in the decision," the New York Times said. Enron's stock, which had fallen by 50 percent since January, dropped another 14 percent in two days. 
Some commentators unloaded on the company. "Until they clear this one up, Enron's a goner," former money manager Jim Cramer wrote on RealMoney.com. 
But hard information was scarce. "It's almost as if you have to use forensic accountants when you're doing a company story because many companies are using very aggressive accounting techniques that are perfectly legal," Shepard says. 
Enron fired Fastow in October for overseeing questionable off-the-books partnerships, and in November the company admitted overstating its profits by $600 million. But most papers played these stories on their business pages. 
Even Enron's Dec. 2 declaration of bankruptcy failed to make the front pages of USA Today, The Washington Post, the Boston Globe and the Philadelphia Inquirer. The CBS, NBC and ABC evening newscasts each gave the announcement two sentences. The media were still heavily focused on the war in Afghanistan. 
Now that Enron's stock has been booted off the New York Stock Exchange, Fortune staffers can't say enough about the way McLean defied both Enron executives and conventional wisdom. 
"It was a gutsy thing to do," Kirkland says. "We trusted her. When you look back it's obvious: Why weren't we all asking these questions?"

The Big City
Blame Game Has Two Sets Of Standards

WHEN bad things happen to bad companies, Washington likes to believe that it's hearing a cry for help from Wall Street. Now that Enron has collapsed, politicians are frantically investigating and vowing to protect us against greedy corporate executives. 
Prosecuting fraud and other crimes is certainly a government job, but as politicians rush to make larger reforms of the private sector, it is instructive to compare the responses to Enron and to a bigger disaster: the failure of Washington to protect Lower Manhattan on Sept. 11.
It's still not clear what, if any, criminal behavior occurred at Enron and its auditor, Arthur Andersen, but already the companies involved have suffered serious consequences. Enron is bankrupt, and there is concern that Andersen will not survive because of the blow to its reputation. 
Executives at the companies have been fired and suspended. Whether or not criminal charges are filed, both companies are already facing lawsuits from shareholders, creditors and other plaintiffs. They also face investigations by four government agencies and six Congressional committees -- all over a company that declared bankruptcy only last month. 
Meanwhile, more than four months since Sept. 11, politicians still haven't taken a hard look at mistakes by the C.I.A. or the F.B.I. 
Congressional leaders and the White House agreed in late November that it would be premature to start formal investigations last year. The agencies, far from facing the threat of bankruptcy, could wind up with budget increases to step up the war on terrorism. 
As government employees, C.I.A. and F.B.I. officials enjoy immunity against lawsuits for their mistakes, and so far they don't even seem particularly embarrassed. The leaders of the agencies haven't resigned, announced dramatic purges or explained what went wrong. 
Granted, their mistakes were probably not criminal, but then neither were some of the mistakes being investigated and litigated in the Enron scandal. The errors in judgment at the C.I.A. and the F.B.I had far more grave consequences than Enron's collapse, and some of the errors could have been avoided. 
Consider a couple of warnings before Sept. 11 that went unheeded: 
*Reuel Marc Gerecht, a C.I.A. veteran in the Middle East who quit out of frustration, criticized agency officials for perpetrating the myth that America had an effective counterterrorism program against Osama bin Laden. In an article published last summer in The Atlantic Monthly, he argued that not a single C.I.A. officer had the skills and willingness to infiltrate bin Laden's operations in the mountains of Afghanistan. ''Operations that include diarrhea as a way of life don't happen,'' a young C.I.A. case officer told him. Mr. Gerecht predicted that unless one of Osama bin Laden's ''foot soldiers walks through the door of a U.S. consulate or embassy, the odds that a C.I.A. counterterrorist officer will ever see one are extremely poor.'' He criticized George J. Tenet, the director of central intelligence, for assuring the public that the C.I.A.'s efforts were keeping bin Laden's terrorists ''off-balance.'' 
*The F.B.I. was warned in August by a flight school in Minnesota that a student could be planning to use a commercial plane as a weapon, according to United States Representative James L. Oberstar, Democrat of Minnesota. The student, Zacarias Moussaoui, later charged with complicity in the Sept. 11 attacks, was arrested in August on immigration charges. But officials at F.B.I. headquarters in Washington resisted a broader investigation despite being urged by the school and by federal agents in Minnesota, and despite a warning from French officials that Mr. Moussaoui was linked to Muslim extremists. 
HOW much blame does the F.B.I. deserve? Suppose this private-public interaction had been reversed. Suppose that public officials had warned a private airline that a passenger might be a terrorist, and suppose that higher-ups at the airline ignored the warnings from the officials as well as suspicions from their own employees. 
If the warnings proved correct and a plane was blown up, the executives at that airline would probably be in about the same position as the ones at Enron and Andersen today: contemplating bankruptcy, looking for new jobs, preparing to face a slew of lawsuits and Congressional investigations. They would not be anticipating an increase in their budget. 
If you're going to make that kind of mistake, do it on government time.

ENRON ENLIGHTENMENT LOTS OF QUESTIONS AND A NEED FOR ANSWERS

01/18/2002
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
REGION
A-18
(Copyright 2002)

The dramatic failure of the Enron Corp., America's seventh- largest company, will soon be examined in depth in an investigation coordinated by the Department of Justice and in various congressional hearings. 
The goal of this necessary inquest should be twofold: to determine whether violations of law or regulations took place and to discern whether new legislation or regulation is necessary to avoid -- or mitigate the impact of -- future disasters.
As is the American way, there also will be attempts to point fingers. Because politicians are involved and 2002 is an important election year, there will be efforts by partisans to pin the blame for Enron-produced damage on rivals. 
At the very least, there probably are serious lessons to be learned from what happened. Some of it certainly should not be allowed to be repeated, if possible, although companies do fail. The fate of Enron and those responsible for its fall, if dissected properly, should also serve as a shot across the bow of other American companies. That goes for firms with something to hide, or accounting firms willing to fudge on the clean bills of health they are giving their clients. 
The Justice Department and Congress need to address some of the following questions: 
* Was it legal when Enron's 29 top executives sold off $1.1 billion of company stock even as they blocked, during the last two months of the company's pre-bankruptcy life, the sale of Enron stock by employees from their 401(k) accounts? If such behavior was legal, should it be legal in the future, or do employees need more protection in such circumstances? Ethical questions also must be addressed. Putting all of one's retirement fund in the stock of one's employer violates two cardinal rules of investing: 1) Diversify and 2) Let the Buyer Beware. 
* Why did accounting firm Arthur Andersen miss or choose not to see Enron's true financial situation, including Enron's now-admitted overstatement of company profits by $600 million over five years? And was Andersen's acceptance of an annual $52 million in consulting fees from Enron consistent with Securities and Exchange Commission regulations requiring an auditing firm's independence from its clients? Does Andersen's dismissal of the auditor responsible for Enron answer all of the questions about the destruction of documents sought by federal regulators? 
* Did Houston-based Enron's leaders' contributions to, and relations with, a former Texas governor, now president of the United States, play any role as the company operated and then maneuvered as it began to fall? 
We tend to see the telephone calls that Enron executives made to Cabinet members and other Bush administration officials -- and their "no-bailout" response -- as correct. Would anyone have wanted Enron not to have alerted senior U.S. government officials to the imminent collapse of America's seventh-largest company? If there is more to those contacts -- inappropriate, illegal or defensible -- it must come out, in the hearings and in the criminal investigation.

AS ENRONGATE UNFOLDS, A PARTISAN'S HEART LEAPS WITH GLEE

MATTHEW MILLER 
LOS ANGELES
I knew something was up when I felt that first frisson of glee shudder through me the day Enron consumed the world like a great tide. 
It peaked when Paul O'Neill looked at Lou Dobbs on TV that first night and, apropos of the implications for pension and accounting laws, deadpanned, "This is not about Enron." Lou and I shook our heads and smiled knowingly. 
Like any postmodern man in the age of self-help and self- absorption, I try to keep abreast of any unusual fluctuations in my emotional state. What I was feeling, I realized, went beyond mere schadenfraude, that perverse delight in another's misery so common among writers and other petty professions. 
No, this was a fuller-blown excitement, reflecting a deep well of despair discernable only because it was now suddenly producing such a gusher of hope: Yes! I thought. Maybe this will at last take a bite out of those Bushies and stop their evil domestic agenda in its tracks! 
Let me step back. As far as I'm concerned, President Bush has been doing a fine job on the terror front to date, and I'm praying he and his team continue to fare well there. And I swear, people who know me will tell you I'm usually a substantive guy immune to blind partisanship. Why, I'm as likely to blast Democrats for demagoguing needed Social Security reforms or fighting the potential of vouchers for urban schoolkids as to slam Republicans for shafting the poor. Really! 
But Bush's overriding domestic thrust -- cutting taxes for the well-off and shorting everything else save defense -- plainly has me undone. Especially because Bush and Karl Rove have been shrewd enough to pretend, successfully, that this is not what Bush is doing. And Democrats are too clueless or gutless or shameless to stop it. 
Sometimes you need a little divine intervention. Enron, rightly understood, is obviously the gift of a vengeful Almighty. 
It's true there may turn out to be no malfeasance by the White House, and I'll sidestep that in a second. But there's no denying the potential here. Enron is a peerless symbol of truths that conservatives have long purged from acceptable discourse. There's rot at the top. The system is rigged. Free markets don't work by themselves. The little guy needs a break. 
And yes -- drum roll, please -- government can help. 
These are lessons citizens need to relearn. And now -- with a little coaxing, of course -- they'll play out day after day on the news. 
Yes, in exploiting this situation I realize I may be yielding to dark impulses that have bloodied humanity since the dawn of time. And rationalizing it as justifiable tit-for-tat after all the bogus garbage Republicans shoveled at Bill Clinton for eight years -- a line of thought that, now that you mention it, does have something to recommend it -- only takes you down the road that's left the Middle East a vale of tears. What's more, like most people who feel the way I do, I could've just carped on about some aspect of the Enron scam itself and not revealed my deepest feelings. 
But I'm human. I know it's weak, but I can't stop myself. I cheer Henry Waxman's subpoenas. I'm stocking up on popcorn for those Lieberman hearings. And when former Clinton press secretary Joe Lockhart says, "The facts can almost take on a secondary role in these things -- for better or worse, this will not ultimately rest on whether someone can prove that someone did something wrong," my first thought is: "Well, let's certainly hope not!" 
I'm not proud. But I know I'm not alone. I'm working it through. I just wanted to share.

"This just keeps getting better and better," Liisa sputters. By that, my wife means worse and worse. Which is what we're all thinking, isn't it? 
Before dawn, we are up and tearing into the newspapers at my household. This is terrific, heart-racing stuff.
"Look, Enron paid no income taxes four out of five years!" 
"Forget Enron, Andersen is being paid by the Justice Department to reorganize the FBI!" 
"Get this: Enron had 881 offshore subsidiaries!" 
"Wow, a professor who became a New York Times editorial columnist was paid $50,000 as an Enron advisor!" 
We're trying not to talk over each other. I'm scribbling notes all over the paper and Liisa is warning me not to make the story illegible. We subscribe to four newspapers. Suddenly it's not enough. 
This is the juiciest scandal of our lifetime. 
Why? Because this is not about personal indiscretion, not about sleazy partisan politics, not about runaway foreign policy, not about "gotcha." 
This rotten barrel of apples is all encompassing. Down at the bottom, in the really contaminated slime, Enron/Andersen/et al. is about what we have allowed our nation to become. 
It's about us. It's about winning at any price--not just winning but trouncing--about seeing what you can get away with. It's about greed and the glorification of greed. It's also the football player who deliberately tries to injure his opponent. It's about parents who beat each other up at their kids' sports matches. It's about the hand-to-hand combat of getting your children into the best colleges so they will be the dog that eats instead of the dog that gets eaten. It's about the ugly edge that has crept into our language, so that words such as "intimidation" become virtuous and "honor" a quaint laughingstock. It's about the blue-ribbon professor-cum-economics columnist who acknowledges taking $50,000 from Enron for serving on "a panel that had no function that I was aware of." 
Awhile back, we lost sight of the principle that hard work, diligence and some luck made the man. 
Inexplicably, we veered from the root ideal of civil in civilization. We took what we could and called it ours. We created the lottery for the instant chance at more. We demanded that every business "grow" rather than serve--which sounds a lot less benign than it became, as we watched ourselves transformed into jackals feeding from our own wounds. We watched as our political system was co-opted for pennies by wheeler-dealers who hollowed out the laws with fancy regulations and hidden legislative favors until our vaunted democracy became the instrument of our own oppression. 
We saw simple and honest things devalued. Like the passbook savings account. And employee loyalty--or loyalty of any kind, for that matter. 
You could wish you were high-minded in this age, but weren't you looking for 25% gains on your retirement holdings too? It didn't matter if a company made something, only if it made something happen. It mattered less whether a deed was right than whether you were "in" or "out." 
Where is the smoking gun? 
It's in our hands. 
Yes, George W. Bush is culpable: This freight train crashed on his watch. These were his back-slapping buddies. These are the people he entrusted with government. This is the way-of-life philosophy he championed. 
Let's not forget that just a few weeks ago he denounced Democrats for stalling on a multimillion-dollar, retroactive tax break for Enron and other giant companies. 
Let's remember that his top economics advisor, a former Enron retainer, views the collapse of the company as "a triumph for capitalism." Let's not overlook that his Treasury secretary sees Enron as evidence of the "genius of capitalism." Let's not overlook that his choice to run the GOP has decided to stay on the payroll of a law firm retained by Enron and reserves the right to moonlight as a strategic advisor for the company. 
But Bush didn't create the scandal. It's been in the works for years. He's no more guilty than the people who voted for him, or for those many millions who were suckered into this vision of a cutthroat America where values--that shopworn word--mean nothing at all when measured against the bottom line. 
Perhaps all boats float on a rising tide. But reach down. Tastes like sewer water now, doesn't it? 
I can hardly wait for tomorrow's papers. This is a terrific time. Maybe, finally, at long bloody last, things will get bad enough to make them right.

REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)
Enron's Sins

01/18/2002
The Wall Street Journal
A10
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

A reformed German Communist named Willi Schlamm once said that the "problem with capitalism is capitalists; the problem with socialism is socialism." We've been thinking about that distinction as we try to make sense of Enron's self-immolation. 
The story may be fading away as a political scandal. But merely as a business scandal it's a problem for anyone who believes in free markets. The price for Enron's financial shenanigans won't be paid only by its shareholders, auditors and creditors. Politicians will seize on its sins as another excuse to meddle in financial markets, which is all the more reason for market believers to be ruthless in cleaning out our own closets.
We do know this isn't a scandal of the usual Washington variety. Though the press corps seized on White House reports of calls from Enron officials, the story fizzled when it turned out nothing happened. As our Washington bureau wrote this Tuesday, the cold reality is that corporate political donations guarantee little more than a hearing. For all of Enron's political largesse, it couldn't order up a bailout or even the regulatory nod requested by former Treasury Secretary-turned-Enron-lender Robert Rubin. We knew the political scandal had gone poof when the Beltway started using Enron as one more prop for "campaign finance reform." Yawn. 
Washington is fascinated nonetheless because of Enron's size and symbolism; Enron's long self-promotion as the vanguard of the New Economy increases the Schadenfreude at its collapse. Above all, this looks like a case of corporate deceit. Whether or not Enron's actions violated any laws, they certainly violated the public trust essential for free markets to work. For that alone its managers deserve the public stocks. 
The details of Enron's now famous off-balance-sheet partnerships remain murky. But it's clear they were an attempt to disguise losses from bad investments. The partnerships, backed by Enron shares, moved risky businesses off its own balance sheet. If these businesses worked, Enron booked the profits, which helped pump up its share price. But when the businesses flopped, Enron covered the losses by issuing more of its shares; this worked for as long as Enron's stock price stayed high but it became a kind of Ponzi scheme once its shares began to fall. 
This was at the very least deceptive accounting. Adding to their sleazy appearance the partnerships paid fees to Enron officials who were also principals in the partnerships. Former CFO Andrew Fastow earned more than $30 million from this sweet arrangement. Enron can say all of this was reported in its 10-Qs, but the company made its filings as obscure as possible. Financial pros couldn't figure them out, much less employees with their life savings in Enron stock. The point of accounting is transparency, which means writing in something other than hieroglyphics. 
Yes, we know, Arthur Andersen was supposed to blow the whistle on all of this as Enron's outside auditor. But as any junior market reporter knows, auditors almost never discover these schemes. Shredding documents is a more serious matter, but auditors can't sit at every CFO's shoulder like a guilty conscience. Even internal auditors rarely discover scams and audit committees of the boards of directors even less often. 
We're all for a big debate over corporate governance. But somehow we doubt the early proposals for a new layer of auditors to watch over the old ones is an improvement. As our Holman Jenkins wrote Wednesday, a better idea might be to drop the federal mandate for an annual audit, which has become a phony good housekeeping seal of approval. Let CEOs take responsibility for their own numbers and make a credible audit something of competitive value. 
We'd say it's also impossible to understand Enron outside of the moral climate in which it flourished. Those were the roaring '90s, when all of America reveled in the economic boom. They were also the Clinton years, when we learned that "everybody does it." The culture wanted to believe in Enron's promises, which helps explain why 16 of 17 Wall Street analysts rated Enron a "buy" as recently as last October. 
Enron's failure reveals the underside of that boom. Human nature being what it is -- and capitalists being human -- some will lose their moral bearings, others will make mistakes and try to cover them up. Had Enron merely admitted its bad investments and taken a $20 billion write-off the way most companies do, it might still be around. Its managers would no longer be feted as geniuses of the new economy, but that's a better fate than they face now. 
The burden on the political and financial system now is to clean up Enron, and learn from its failures, without doing further damage. In the Washington tradition, this may mean burning some people or companies at the stake, but maybe in this case they deserve it. We are sure going to find out. 
In all of this, we should add, the Bush Administration has so far shown the right instincts. President Bush called early for investigations that are now taking place, both civil and criminal. His advisers seem to be following the ancient political wisdom, ignored during the Clinton years, that telling all early is the best defense. 
A Republican Administration, with its alleged sympathies for markets, has a special burden to police capitalists who abuse their freedom. If the Bushies do this the right way, they can restore trust in markets and ensure that Enron's sins will do less permanent damage to capitalism.

'IF MEN were angels," James Madison wrote in No. 51 of the Federalist Papers, "no government would be necessary." It is one of the most celebrated quotations in American history. Yet it takes some large event every generation or so to remind us how right Madison was. 
The Enron Moment is a great catastrophe, especially for the thousands of workers bilked out of their life savings. But it is also an opportunity to sweep aside the sanctimonious cant upon which a generation's worth of political arguments were built.
Are markets always self-regulating? No. Is deregulation always the answer? No. Are capitalists always well-behaved and public-spirited? No. Can we ignore the impact of our campaign money system on politicians? No. Can we be indifferent to the undue influence that certain big companies have on our government? No. Can rank-and-file employees do without the protections of law against the abuses of more powerful actors in the marketplace? No. 
In the boom years, many chose to forget the simple genius of the American proposition. It is rooted in what economist John Kenneth Galbraith saw as a system of "countervailing power." We put limits on government because we don't want it to dominate our lives. But, in turn, we rely on government to check concentrations of private power. 
Americans have always been suspicious of excessive power anywhere - in government or the marketplace. 
It's true, of course, that Enron went down, and this will be seen by some as the marketplace doing its excellent work of "self- policing." But don't try to sell this view to Enron employees or investors who relied on the "self-policing" of private accounting firms and thought Enron's numbers were on the level. 
Smart capitalists have always understood that the system works only if there are strong rules to guarantee honest information and to check corporate misbehavior. As Madison might have put it, if capitalists were angels, we could deregulate everything. But capitalists are no more angelic than anyone else. 
Some members of Congress will thus have to answer for their success in blocking the efforts of Arthur Levitt, the former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, to impose rational restrictions on accounting firms. Levitt - boy, does he look good now - thought it a mistake for firms to do both auditing and consulting work for the same client. Levitt also has argued recently that publicly traded companies need to include genuinely independent members on their corporate boards of directors. Otherwise, no one on the inside is keeping the big boys honest. 
And, speaking of transparency, the public needs to know more than it does about how corporations such as Enron influence government policy. 
That's why Vice President Dick Cheney should disclose all the details about his consultations in formulating the administration's energy plan. 
Full disclosure by the energy task force was once a Democratic cause championed by Rep. Henry Waxman of California. Now, many Republicans know the administration will only deepen public suspicions if it keeps holding back. "It is just basic information that should be provided and isn't all that big a deal," says Rep. Christopher Shays, a Connecticut Republican, "except for the fact that the administration doesn't want to share it, which makes it a big deal." 
And those who oppose trying to limit the influence of money on politics should consider Attorney General John Ashcroft's decision to recuse himself from the Enron case because he had received campaign contributions connected to Enron. The Justice Department explained the recusal in a nicely inclusive phrase, referring to "the totality of the circumstances of the relationship between Enron and the attorney general." 
If we're worried about how contributions might affect - or be seen to affect - Ashcroft's behavior as attorney general, shouldn't we also be worried about how contributions might affect the behavior of members of Congress? Should there really be such a huge difference between the standards we'd impose on John Ashcroft, attorney general, as opposed to John Aschroft, United States senator? 
What, finally, will President George W. Bush do about the Enron Moment? The question here goes beyond the usual scandal investigations: Has this financial catastrophe changed any of the president's views on the energy industry and how it should be regulated, or on corporate abuses and how they can be prevented? The real scandal would be to allow the Enron Moment to pass without its teaching us that Madison was right all along.

ENRON EXECUTIVES DESERVE TO BE HIT BY A TWAIN

(Copyright 2002)

Occasionally, I wake up in the morning depressed that Mark Twain will never stare back at me from the bathroom mirror. 
This is something most columnists learn to accept with practice. After all, it takes a particular set of experiences to be somebody else. And Twain would've considered any envy of his life -- stuffed as it was with an abundance of family tragedies and bad investments - - a peculiar malady indeed.
Still, I think about Twain from time to time and wonder how he might have reacted to the controversies of our day. Were he still with us, he would undoubtedly be about the business of skewering the pretensions of our corporate masters, their paid vassals in Congress and their unpaid vassals in the media. 
But Twain has been dead for 97 years -- and we're not feeling too good ourselves. Those of us who toil fitfully in his shadow carry on as best we can, cursed with a sense of moral outrage that's far less developed. Though our obtuseness keeps us out of trouble, it also greases the wheels of our continued irrelevance. 
Some of us flatter ourselves with the most obvious excuse in the world: Because we'll never possess Twain's gift for devastating put- downs, we have no choice but to put up with the authoritarian nonsense that's taken root in American life since Sept. 11. 
So, it may be time to go to the source. 
Every night on a creepy television program called "Crossing Over With John Edward," a media-savvy professional guesser bamboozles the gullible into believing the dead have nothing better to do than to stand around limbo waiting for a dull studio audience to call. 
And no wonder. The spirits Edward chats with nightly appear intent on maintaining even more banality in death than they ever mustered in life. So much for ascending to a "higher plane." 
Still, I'd pay Edward good money if he could corral Twain's ghost for an interview. I'd love to know how the self-styled "Missouri Yankee" thinks America has changed since he left us a century ago. 
Despite our era's superficial resemblance to the Gilded Age, an era Twain wrote about in a best-selling book, I suspect even he would be scandalized by the level of greed and criminal collusion manifested at the highest levels of industry and government these days. 
He'd be appalled, but not surprised, by Enron's collapse. Fresh revelations about how the bankrupt corporation paid no income taxes for four of the last five years draw a bored "it figures" from most ordinary citizens. 
But Twain's hilariously scathing essay, written in the throes of outrage, would be circulating by the end of the day. With comic understatement, he'd illustrate how campaign contributions to nearly every member of America's political ruling class shielded Enron's deceptive business practices long enough for its managers to loot the company's most precious asset -- the retirement portfolios of its workers. 
Wall Street analysts and editorial writers might consider it a less than nuanced treatment of a complex failure, but I suspect only Twain's take on this shameful episode would be enough to generate the universal moral outrage it deserves. 
This isn't to say that terrific pieces about the Enron scandal haven't been published already. They appear every day, thank goodness. But none have generated the level of indignation about political corruption and capitalist excess that Twain's pieces about the Gilded Age did more than a century ago. 
There's still time. This scandal is young and congressional hearings might turn on a few dramatic moments, but I'm not holding my breath that a single scoundrel will go to jail -- a fate the top layer of Enron executives richly deserves. 
In the end, my Twain fixation may be evidence that I'm just a sentimental guy who wants a hero from another age to do my dirty work. Guilty as charged! It may be silly, but I can think of worse things than to be haunted by the ghost of Samuel Clemens.

A widow invests her money in one of the most admired companies in America. 
A new father purchases the vehicle of his dreams.
A young high school graduate gets a job that is the envy of her peers. 
Unfortunately, the company the widow invested in was Enron Corp. 
The vehicle was a Ford Explorer on Firestone tires. 
The great new job was at Mitsubishi Motors Corp. 
All three people trusted. And they should have. They were dealing with highly respected companies. 
Mitsubishi is one of the largest employers in central Illinois. Its state of the art factory brought badly needed jobs and manufacturing savvy to America's heartland. Yet in 1998 its management also paid $34 million to settle sexual harassment claims against it, from many women like our high school graduate. 
Ford and Firestone are two of the most illustrious names in corporate history. Each was founded just over 100 years ago, by individuals so confident in their personal reputations that they put their names on their companies. They are two companies that millions of drivers place their trust in every time they slide behind the wheel. 
We don't yet know all the reasons for the series of accidents involving Ford Explorers and Firestone tires. But we do know that many, many people could have acted earlier to address the crashes, and did not. And as a result, the reputations of two great companies may be irreparably damaged. 
Of course the true toll from the Firestone/Ford disaster is measured in lives--not dollars--lost. Hundreds of lives snuffed out prematurely because ordinary workers, managers, executives and lawyers failed to do the right thing. 
Companies that deal with the lives and money of consumers understand that they are in the trust business. Car companies and airlines and restaurants and food companies understand that if people don't trust their safety, they will not buy their products or services. Banks, brokerages, insurance companies and accounting firms know that if they aren't trusted, their businesses will dry up. They also know that trust is grounded in integrity. Unfortunately, most businesses haven't viewed trust as their single most important attribute. 
Enron changed that. 
Enron was on top of the world. We all had good reason to invest in Enron. In 2000, it was the seventh largest company in America. In its February 2001 annual reputation survey results, Fortune magazine listed Enron as the most innovative company in the United States. It also was the second-most-admired company for "quality of management." But it failed by not making integrity--the integrity that is the basis of all trust--the company's highest value. Failure of trust is ultimately what caused Enron's market value to crash from $70 billion to less than $1 billion in less than one year. 
And what Enron's executives failed to understand was that their business--like every other business--is based on trust. Enron was an intermediary in thousands of transactions worth hundreds of billions of dollars. All parties to the transactions needed to trust Enron. After a while, they did not. 
Enron was the recipient of billions of dollars in loans from banks. Getting such loans required the banks to trust Enron. After a while, they did not. 
Enron's currency was its stock price, which needed the trust of the investment community to sustain it. Enron lost that, too. 
Once trust is damaged, it takes enormous effort to regain it. It is not simply an exercise in damage control. It is a test of integrity and transparency. It is a test now faced by Enron's auditor, Arthur Andersen, whose very future depends on being able to reclaim the trust of Congress, clients and the investing public. Enron and Andersen have become the latest in an unfortunate series of corporate poster children that make the case for the importance of trust. 
Underestimating the importance of trust is not just a corporate failing. Poor George O'Leary was just two resume falsifications away from college football's dream job--coach of Notre Dame--and a multimillion-dollar pay package. Consider Henry Blodget, the once high-flying Internet analyst at Merrill Lynch & Co. who was forced out of his job because nobody trusted him anymore. 
These days it seems like there are far too many examples that remind us that trust is the key to winning for individuals and institutions. The integrity that underlies that trust is the basis for saving our businesses, our careers, and maybe even ourselves.

Blind ambition: Good and shameful ; Sorting out the tales of 2 mind-sets

As the Enron Corp. scandal unraveled further this week, two dominating American characters for our times began to come into focus. 
One was the Enron-type boss, who, according to much of the data so far, looked upon America primarily as a game. The other was the New York policeman/firefighter/public servant who saw America as a community to be served.
The news indicated that for three years the Enron higher-ups held back crucial information that the company was actually failing instead of making all the money it claimed. And all the while, they secured their own fortunes by selling stock, even as uninformed underlings were losing their entire pension plans and thus their very futures. 
This same week, New York City announced that ground zero had largely been cleared and that the site was now below ground for the first time since Sept. 11. That fact only serves, of course, as a further benediction for those public servants who so courageously assaulted the collapsing World Trade Center, attempting to save their fellow citizens' lives. 
But perhaps the real benediction for Enron was expressed most vividly by USA Today in an article this week: "Analysts for more than a year were complaining they couldn't figure out how Enron made money." One of the problems, the national newspaper said, was that the entire system (of which Enron was in many ways the Cinderella) was "unchecked," and that it had come to the point at which the people involved should be liable for their actions. 
Two Americas, and two types of Americans. Two very different worlds, and both within us. 
Surely the differences between these worlds would not be so grating were it not for Sept. 11 and its aftermath. The terrorist attacks on New York and Washington brought forth, along with so much else, the confident assurance that now patriotism would once again reign--unity of nation and of purpose would return to us after a long period of ambivalence among our elites about the American dream. 
But polls and other indicators show that while putting out flags is popular, large numbers of younger Americans embrace an emotional feeling of unity without understanding that the underpinnings of strengthening civic education and teaching U.S. history are crucial to true national unity. 
At this point, almost as a specter of our divisions, came the Enron scandal, which threatens to tell us more than we may have wanted to know about certain predominant aspects of America's most fashionable--and deceiving--corporate mind and how it differs from the old community mind. 
The Enron mind, at least as we are seeing it revealed, had executives playing a game for fame, for money, for power. Its practitioners looked to their corporate form of business not to create products or real wealth, or to upgrade the status of other Americans, but to make themselves into dominating personalities in America. They looked upon their employees simply as functionaries in their machine, although there was also a cultish feeling about the corporation. 
Finally, they had no sense of traditional American community, and in fact derided such an outmoded concept, while they never risked anything real. 
Gen. Wesley K. Clark, former NATO commander during the air war against Kosovo three years ago, spoke indirectly of the way in which this elitist American mind-set assumes that others will go overseas to fight for America while they go about their business. 
"Everybody says he's patriotic," he remarked to a meeting of the Center for Strategic and International Studies recently, "but I was at a football game in Arkansas the other day, and I asked several guys whether they were going to join up. One said, well, no, he had his business . . . another said, no, he was getting married . . . " 
The public servant mind-set is very different indeed. This mind- set is rooted in American values and principles, and high in that pantheon is a profound sense of family and community. That is why firefighters and police risked--and why so many gave--their lives. Life is real, and its consequences are real. They look upon others as equals in their quests, and they actually often believe in a human soul. 
They accept responsibility for their actions as part of the reality of a moral universe, and they will stand up, even against fashion's inexorable tides, for what they believe is right. They were "we," while the Enron-type person is "me,"--and despite Sept. 11, there is no assurance yet which group will dominate America in the future.

The Enron Debacle: Be Forewarned . . .

To the Editor: 
''Enron and the Gramms,'' by Bob Herbert (column, Jan. 17), highlights one of many instances where big business has infiltrated the political and regulatory process. Surely there are countless others besides Senator Phil Gramm and his wife, Wendy Gramm, a former government official, who have danced to the tune of large corporations. The only way to keep this from happening again, and innocent working families from losing everything, is to keep money out of politics. 
Enron and other large companies have been writing checks to politicians to promote their businesses and discourage oversight for years.
If and when campaign finance reform ever happens, and it clearly will not happen under a Republican administration, politicians can make decisions based on moral grounds instead of on personal and party financial gain.

TAKING STOCK
Opportunists may benefit if embattled Kmart files for Chapter 11

For several days now, investors have been scrambling over each other to bail out of Kmart before the U.S. retail giant stumbles over the precipice. 
The race for the exits may well turn out to have been justified, but it shows just how skittish the investment community has become in the wake of the bursting tech bubble and the shocking collapse of Enron, a once-prized name in most debt and equity portfolios.
Unlike Enron, which as we now know faked its numbers, Kmart has been exhibiting the classic symptoms of a company in deep trouble for years. It has been hammered by Wal-Mart and its other major competitors in a brutal retail environment. And despite its best efforts, things have gone from bad to worse in recent months. 
The company was one of the few big retail names that missed its own modest Christmas sales targets, and won't come close to meeting forecasts for the fiscal year. The president walked the plank yesterday. The board turned itself over to yet another turnaround specialist. It desperately needs more cash and its bonds are now rated at the bottom end of the junk pile. 
The result has been a predictable exit by bondholders, a stunning flight by equity investors, and opportunistic buying by the vultures. 
In a matter of weeks, Kmart has turned from a potential turnaround story being touted as a cheap way to play the discount retail segment into one of those investments that must not be held at any price. 
In heavy trading of 75.6 million shares yesterday, Kmart actually rose 3 cents (U.S.) to $1.63, briefly halting a slide that has lopped off more than 60 per cent of its value in a week. On Wednesday alone, 177 million shares -- close to a third of all the stock outstanding -- changed ownership, as the price plunged 36 per cent. No other stock traded so heavily. 
In many cases, fund managers simply had no choice. The stock was dropped from the S&P 500 this week, as the company's market capitalization fell well below $1-billion. It stood at more than $5-billion last August. 
On the bond side, only distressed debt funds will touch credits like Kmart at single-B or triple-C levels. That's where rating agencies place debt they think is in serious danger of default. 
Now, it could be argued that the debt monitors are being somewhat hasty here. The company doesn't have much borrowing room left, but the banks indicated in November that they would be willing to negotiate. And so far, at least on the anecdotal evidence of some major suppliers, Kmart is still paying its bills. 
But the big rating agencies have looked sloppy and slow-footed in failing to take swift action on numerous previous occasions, and it's plain they didn't want it to happen again. 
The latest and most embarrassing case was Enron, which retained its crucial investment-grade rating into November, well after it became clear that it was having critical liquidity problems. Earlier, they failed to downgrade two California utilities until they defaulted. 
Just a year ago, Kmart was looking like a smart bet. Its savvy and tough chief executive officer, Chuck Conaway, who had turned the CVS pharmacy chain into a stock market winner, was about six months into a massive restructuring. The company closed smaller stores and earmarked huge sums to revamp its inventory, distribution and sales systems. This included $2-billion for computer technology in an effort to boost efficiency dramatically and better compete with mighty Wal-Mart and the Target chain, its biggest competitors, along with the rising warehouse clubs. 
Analysts liked Mr. Conaway's strategy and his track record. From January to an August high of $13.55, the stock more than doubled. 
But as the economic slump worsened and Wal-Mart and Target continued to gain market share at Kmart's expense, it was plain that the company's turnaround strategy wasn't working. Its prices were simply not low enough to lure customers back from Wal-Mart, which outsells Kmart by a margin of nearly two to one per square foot of store space, and it lacked Target's reputation for brand names at good prices. As losses mounted, it actually cut advertising expenses, never a sound business strategy during a downturn. 
In a research note Jan. 2, Prudential Securities retail analyst Wayne Hood suggested a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing would help get Kmart out of its self-inflicted pickle. Under the umbrella of court protection, Kmart could shed costly leases, close hundreds of stores and restructure debt. 
Noted Wall Street value fund manager Marty Whitman has been buying up Kmart debt, although he won't go near the stock. 
"Now I don't know if Kmart's going to file or not. Probably not. But I would be convinced that if they do file, the creditors are going to receive par plus accrued in the reorganization," he said in a television interview. 
Why the bullishness? Plenty of value in the company's 2,100 stores and its $37-billion in annual sales in fiscal 2001. 
With the debt changing hands at 50 cents or so on the dollar, investors would be looking at eventual yields above 75 per cent, although there could be a long wait for a payoff. But if Kmart opts for Chapter 11, shareholders are likely to get nothing. bmilner@globeandmail.ca

City - City Diary - Enron going, going, gone.

IT IS easy to laugh at the growing market for Enron memorabilia on the eBay internet auction site - and almost impossible not to. 
Items include an Enron "Visions and Values" paperweight listing the company's core values as "communication, excellence, respect and integrity". There is also a corporate stress ball bearing the company motto "Ask Why?". For #313 you can have the Enron Risk Management Manual, an extract from which reads: "By using certain structures, companies can re-categorize expenses in such a manner as to improve the perceived financial performance."
I think my favourite, however, is the Enron Code of Ethics, yours for just #200, and I'm a fool to myself, guv'nor.

Hot spell forces blackouts: More outages are probable today in a likely 
preview of a long, hot summer.
By Carrie Peyton and Dale Kasler
Bee Staff Writers
(Published May 8, 2001) 
It's starting. 
A brief wave of forced blackouts swept across California on Monday, in a 
prelude to what could become the summer of our disconnect. 
Lights and air conditioners began flicking off just before 5 p.m., affecting 
more than 100,000 homes and businesses from San Juan Capistrano to the 
Central Valley for about an hour. 
Too many air conditioners straining against an early heat wave and too many 
power plants temporarily closed for repairs or upgrades combined to overload 
the state's electric grid, according to the California Independent System 
Operator. 
"The load ended up 2,500 megawatts higher than what I saw (forecast) when I 
walked in this morning," said Jim McIntosh, ISO director of operations. 
He said more blackouts are "probable" today, with more than one-fourth of the 
state's power plants off-line and temperatures expected to sizzle. 
In the Sacramento region, the outages disrupted stores and restaurants and 
darkened traffic lights in Elk Grove, triggering at least one accident. 
Hungry diners were turned away at Tecate Grill in Elk Grove, Target shoppers 
were shooed out after paying for purchases at battery-operated cash 
registers, and disappointed browsers clustered outside Borders Books. 
"They didn't believe they had to leave," said Borders manager Tammi Kole. 
Even grid operators were a little taken aback by the quick flurry of 
blackouts, ordered at 4:45 p.m., less than three hours after McIntosh said at 
a press conference that the state probably had escaped power disruptions for 
the day. 
"We thought things were under control," he said later, but an expected late 
afternoon decline in demand never materialized, and no more electricity could 
be lined up to bridge the gap. 
He told the state's utilities to cut off 300 megawatts of power, which 
affected about 103,000 homes and businesses, including 4,600 served by the 
Sacramento Municipal Utility District and 54,000 served by Pacific Gas and 
Electric Co. 
PG&E's outages were confined mostly to urban areas with computerized 
switching because the blackouts were ordered on such short notice. 
Southern California Edison wound up blacking out 36,000 customers in 40 
cities, and San Diego Gas & Electric cut power to about 8,600 customers in 
two counties. 
It was California's first glimpse of what a hot summer could do to its frayed 
electric grid, which already has seen January and March blackouts that were 
widely acknowledged to be triggered at least partly by financial chaos in 
electric markets. 
"This is going to be a long summer. We're at risk of blackouts now all the 
way through October," said Mike Zenker of Cambridge Energy Research 
Associates, a consulting firm. 
Industry officials and analysts predict there could be 20 to 36 days this 
summer of rolling blackouts, when electricity is deliberately cut off to keep 
the power grid from collapsing under the strain of overuse. 
Power use this summer will go well above Monday's peak of about 33,000 
megawatts, but late spring is expected to be touch-and-go because so many 
power plants are being retooled to get ready for the summer crunch. 
One unit at PG&E's Diablo Canyon nuclear plant is closed for refueling, part 
of San Onofre nuclear plant is still down for fire-related repairs, and 
numerous smaller plants are undergoing maintenance or air pollution upgrades. 
"May and June are promising to be the worst months of the year," said Gary 
Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum, an association of generators. 
"This is something we're going to have to get used to." 
The ISO and utilities around the state repeated their calls for consumers to 
raise thermostats, draw blinds, shut off unneeded appliances and do 
everything possible to put a damper on power usage from about noon through 
early evening. 
"We're going to need conservation," said the ISO's McIntosh "As we roll into 
summer, that's the only way we're going to avoid large-scale interruptions." 
The ISO has forecast potential blackouts for any day when demand soars above 
40,000 megawatts, which happened 34 times last summer. 
But as 2001 has shown five times already, blackouts can occur at far lower 
usage levels, and no one can really say for sure how bad it might get. 
In Sacramento, SMUD is trying to recruit more people for a wide range of 
conservation efforts, including a revised "Peak Corp" program, which will pay 
volunteers for each time it remotely shuts off their air conditioners. 
"I don't think it's ever been more important," said Mike Weedall, SMUD 
manager of energy services. 
"We've got a real challenge here in California, and energy efficiency, 
despite what the vice president says, is a very important option and a very 
viable option." 
Earlier Monday, unusually warm weather, refueling and repair closures at four 
Western nuclear plants, and a three-hour blip in power imports from Canada 
combined to bring the grid within five minutes of blackouts, said McIntosh. 
BC Hydro, a government-run Canadian utility, refused to deliver promised 
power for several hours unless it received more money up front from the 
state, according to the state Department of Water Resources. 
The state had to wire the money before shipments were resumed. BC Hydro 
officials declined to comment. 
In addition, temperatures were above normal for much of California. 
Sacramento topped out at 96 degrees downtown, compared with a normal high of 
79 degrees for May 7, according to the National Weather Service. 
High temperatures -- and the risk of rotating outages -- are forecast to 
continue today and decline slightly on Wednesday. 
If more blackouts are needed today, PG&E outages will resume with Block 14 
and then continue on, if needed, into Blocks 1 and 2. SMUD neighborhoods next 
in line for outages include parts of Galt, Elk Grove, Laguna West, Walnut 
Grove, Meadowview, Florin/Fruitridge, Pocket, Greenhaven and South Land Park. 
Monday's outage triggered a two-car crash about 5:30 p.m. at Bruceville Road 
and Kilconnell Drive, where traffic signals were not working, according to 
the California Highway Patrol. 
Robin Lake of Elk Grove was take by ambulance to the hospital with head and 
shoulder injuries. Two people in the other vehicle were not injured.

$13.4 billion bond bill clears split Assembly 
By Jim Sanders
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published May 8, 2001) 
With billions in electricity bills clouding California's budget, state 
lawmakers passed legislation Monday to allow the sale of what is believed to 
be the largest revenue bond in U.S. history to help solve the current crisis. 
The planned sale of up to $13.4 billion in revenue bonds is designed to repay 
the general fund for power purchases made since January and give the state a 
multibillion-dollar pot to draw from to keep the lights on until more power 
plants are built. 
"We have to do it," Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, told 
legislators who were deeply divided along party lines on the bond proposal. 
"We don't have to like it, but we have to do it." 
The Assembly voted 49-29 to authorize the bonds, with only one Republican, 
Anthony Pescetti of Rancho Cordova, supporting the measure. 
The bill failed to receive the two-thirds majority needed for an urgency 
measure, however, meaning that bonds can't be sold until 90 days after the 
end of the Legislature's current special session to address the energy 
crisis. 
The special session is expected to be discontinued this week after Senate 
action on the bill, SB 31x. That vote could come today or Wednesday. 
The measure is designed to keep the state's energy crisis from forcing deep 
cuts in public services next year, but it means that ratepayers would foot 
the bill far into the future for electricity consumed this year and next. 
The multibillion-dollar bonds would be repaid through rate increases recently 
proposed for customers of two debt-ridden private utilities -- Pacific Gas 
and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison. 
A heated, two-hour Assembly debate before the final vote Monday revealed a 
deep philosophical split over how best to shoulder the financial burden for 
an energy market that has spun wildly out of control. 
Republicans argue that using bonds to pay for electricity is like using a 
credit card that would result in massive, long-term interest expenses and 
keep rates high long after new plants have been built and the market 
stabilized. 
"For heaven's sake, when is this going to come to a stop?" asked Assemblyman 
Tim Leslie, R-Tahoe City. 
Republicans argued that California should bite the bullet now and allocate $5 
billion of the state's projected budget surplus to help foot the bill for 
about $6 billion in electricity purchased since January. 
Since that approach would call for all Californians to help rescue customers 
of private utilities, the Republican plan proposed to provide a $1.5 billion 
rebate that would offset any losses to residents served by public utilities. 
But Democrats ripped the plan as a boon to businesses -- which buy the vast 
majority of power in California. They also argued that raiding the general 
fund would jeopardize funding for vital public services ranging from 
education to health care. 
Gov. Gray Davis blasted Republicans for withholding their votes and forcing 
the 90-day wait before the bonds can be sold. 
"The Republican Party that brought us this disastrous energy deregulation 
scheme is now obstructing its solution," the Democratic governor said. 
"Their decision to play partisan politics with the energy crisis seriously 
complicates the budget process and could ultimately threaten our economy." 
Specifically, SB 31x calls for: 
Sale of up to $13.4 billion in revenue bonds. Davis has said about $12.5 
billion is needed to weather the crisis until adequate new power is added to 
the state's supply by Jan. 1, 2003. 
An expedited review of legal challenges to avoid lengthy, potentially 
devastating delays in implementing the state's plan. 
No bond proceeds to be used to reduce the debts of private utilities. 
No general fund money to be used after Nov. 15 for power purchases, with the 
possible exception of $500 million for short-term cash flow purchases. 
Since the bonds can't be sold for at least 90 days, Monday's legislative 
action apparently clouds the state's plan to arrange $4.13 billion in 
short-term financing to repay the general fund prior to the new year's 
budget, Keeley said. 
The state conceivably could craft a contingency budget, with one level of 
spending if the bonds are sold and another if they are not, Keeley said. 
Officials were assessing their options Monday, and some still held out hope 
that agreement could be reached between Republicans and Democrats on a bill 
that could allow the immediate marketing of bonds. 
Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg said he planned to meet with the Republican 
leadership. 
It's not unusual for the state to count on revenues not yet in hand, state 
budget officials said. That happens every year when the state anticipates 
getting some revenue from the federal government, for instance. 
So passing a budget before the bonds are sold won't necessarily throw the 
state budget out of kilter or require cuts. 
"There is a precedent for assuming you're going to be reimbursed," said Brad 
Williams, chief economist of the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst's Office. 
But "this would be on a grand scale," he said. 
The 90-day wait could get the state close to draining its bank accounts, 
which could require it to stop making some payments. 
But the state had a surplus of almost $8 billion going into the fiscal year 
starting July 1 -- an amount higher than expected in January because of 
healthy income tax returns in April. 
There are many variables in the electricity equation, making it uncertain 
whether the state could keep the cash flowing until the bonds are sold in 
August. Among them is the amount the state will get from electricity rates, a 
formula still being settled before the state Public Utilities Commission, and 
the future cost of power. 
Even though the budget could be unscathed by the 90-day wait, however, one 
casualty could be perceptions on Wall Street. 
Joe Fichera, Davis' financial adviser, said the state is probably paying a 
premium in bond interest rates because of the state's political turmoil. 
"Most investors tend to be very risk averse," he said. "They don't want to 
take any chance that they could lend money and have it suddenly not be there. 
"All it does is make Wall Street wonder what's going on over here."

Dan Walters: Summer-like heat brings blackouts, partisan fingerpointing


(Published May 8, 2001) 
Temperatures soared to near the century mark outside California's Capitol on 
Monday as a wave of summer-like heat swept over the state, and the spiking 
electricity load forced power grid operators to impose rolling blackouts on a 
number of communities. 
Just as the power demand reached its peak in the late afternoon, the state 
Assembly began debating a $13.4 billion bond issue aimed at financing 
electricity purchases during the critical summer season. And it soon became 
evident that the partisan atmosphere inside the building was becoming just as 
superheated as the air outside. 
Just one Republican voted for the measure that Gov. Gray Davis and other 
Democratic politicians said was critical to keeping California's lights 
burning and its air conditioners humming, thus blocking its immediate 
implementation. Democrats went to a fallback plan under which the bond issue 
would be approved on a simple majority vote, but it can't take effect for 90 
days, which may make its usefulness doubtful. 
"We have to do it," Assemblyman Fred Keeley of Boulder Creek, the leading 
Democratic power strategist, told the Assembly. "We don't have to like it, 
but we have to do it." 
"We owe our kids a top-notch education," Assemblywoman Lynne Leach, R-Walnut 
Creek, said during the lengthy debate, "not years of debt." 
The partisan clash reflected a sense in the Capitol that the energy crisis is 
growing steadily worse, that Monday's blackouts are just a taste of hours of 
power outages to follow this summer, that utility rates are spiking upwards 
as well, and that voters may look for scapegoats at the polls next year. 
Even before the Assembly vote, Davis issued his sharpest partisan rebuke 
since the crisis erupted, indicating that he, too, is repositioning himself 
in anticipation of a voter backlash. 
"The Republican Party that brought us this disastrous energy deregulation 
scheme is now obstructing its solution," Davis said in a statement several 
hours before the debate began. "Their decision to play partisan politics with 
this energy crisis seriously complicates the budget process and could 
ultimately threaten our economy." 
Davis and other Democrats had enlisted various interest groups -- including 
law enforcement officials -- to pressure Republicans on the bond issue, 
arguing that without the new loan, the state would have to eat the general 
fund advances and reduce spending on a variety of programs to make up the 
difference. Democrats echoed that line in the floor debate while Republicans 
depicted the bond bill as a long-term debt and a sharp increase in utility 
rates to repay it. 
The immediate politics of the situation notwithstanding, there's ample reason 
to be skeptical of the governor's scheme of borrowing heavily not only to 
repay the general fund but to finance power purchases this summer. When Davis 
proposed the first draft of the plan in January, direct state power purchases 
were to last only a few weeks and cost only a few hundred million dollars 
while long-term supply contracts were negotiated. Instead, the state has 
embarked on an open-ended program of buying power, spending up to $2 billion 
a month, while long-term contracts have proved elusive. 
The current version of the plan, moreover, is based on a series of 
assumptions that fly in the face of past and current experience, such as a 
sharp reduction in demand, an equally sharp increase in summer supply and, 
most of all, a steep drop in the prices being charged by generators. If those 
assumptions don't pan out, the state could be spending as much as $5 billion 
a month by midsummer, and even the proposed bond issue, the largest in the 
history of any state, would be consumed within a few weeks. 
Republicans said Monday that they wouldn't vote for a bond issue until they 
had received some reliable assurances that there was an end game. Their 
motives may have been partisan, but their wariness about where California is 
headed is well-founded. No one, including the governor, appears to know 
what's going to happen over the next few months and the governor's figurative 
plea to "trust me" is not reassuring.

Special report
How Californians got burned
The state electricity system is in a shambles, and the worst may be ahead. 
How did things get to this point?


(Published May 6, 2001)

It isn't like California's political and business leaders got together and 
decided to wreck the state's electricity system. It just worked out that way. 
From the very start, a series of critical miscalculations and 
behind-the-scenes efforts of energy brokers, politicians and utilities 
dovetailed almost perfectly to create a new era in California. 
But a months-long review by The Bee of what led to the current fiasco reveals 
that state leaders ignored warnings -- in public testimony, insider memos and 
trade journals -- that their new system would be prone to manipulation and 
price gouging. 
State officials were so eager to move deregulation forward that they even 
kept some warnings from landing in the hands of federal authorities who 
rubber-stamped California's plans. 
Today, the results are well-known: California is drawing down its budget 
surplus at a rate of $50 million or more a day to pay for electricity, 
utilities are broke, rates are going up and summer blackouts are looming. 
But the juggernaut that led to deregulation began a decade ago with the best 
of intentions. 
Part of it stemmed from a warning by former Major League Baseball 
Commissioner Peter Ueberroth. Part of it came from the perilous state of 
California's economy at the time. 
And part of it began with O.J. Simpson. 
The first days
The deck was stacked against Robert Levin from the beginning. 
The expert on energy pricing flew to Los Angeles to warn that California's 
Public Utilities Commission was making a huge mistake. 
An executive with the New York Mercantile Exchange, Levin believed in the 
increased competition the plan was intended to provide, but he thought 
California was tilting toward a system that would actually produce less 
competition -- and higher costs. 

Special report
This special report on California's energy crisis was written by Bee staff 
writer Sam Stanton, with reporting from John Hill of The Bee's Capitol 
Bureau, staff writers Dale Kasler and Stuart Leavenworth and David Whitney of 
The Bee's Washington Bureau. 

Few were listening. 
"I'm not getting through," he told himself at the time. 
It was June 14, 1994, and even though the PUC convened a daylong hearing at 
the Los Angeles Civic Center, there were more important things going on in 
the world. 
Composer Henry Mancini died that day from cancer. President Clinton had just 
unveiled his welfare reform proposal. And Los Angeles police detectives were 
starting their probe of the mysterious slaying two days earlier of O.J. 
Simpson's ex-wife and a friend. 
"That was kind of the buzz," Levin said of Nicole Brown Simpson's and Ron 
Goldman's murders. "More than electricity deregulation." 
O.J. Simpson's influence ended there, but the incident was indicative of how 
little attention people were paying to the deregulation process at the time. 
Today, nearly seven years later, Levin's futile warning stands as one of many 
that were leveled -- and blithely ignored -- as a consortium of elected 
officials, utility executives and energy traders marched California into one 
of the greatest policy blunders of the past century. 
The perfect storm
Some now blame California's current predicament on a series of unavoidable 
acts of nature, the so-called "Perfect Storm" scenario: 
A hot summer last year in California that sent demand for power soaring. 
A cold snap last winter in the East that drove up prices for natural gas, 
widely used in plants that generate electricity. 
A 50 percent cut in the amount of power received from the Northwest because 
of drought, environmental concerns and increased demand there. 
"It's only because of those three acts of God that we got screwed up," said 
P. Gregory Conlon, a former PUC president. 
Power generators insist the price spikes that began in 2000 resulted from 
genuine supply and demand imbalances. 
But scores of market analysts, including officials at the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission, suggest that generators were able to ratchet up prices 
through various trading strategies, including the simplest: throttling back 
on production until prices increased. 
And ample evidence indicates that policy-makers should have known years ago 
that the system they set up was ripe for such manipulation. 
San Diego Gas & Electric figured it out early. 

How it happened
Here's a look at key actions taken on the road to power deregulation in 
California: 
The PUC
The California Public Utilities Commission approved the state's deregulation 
plan on Dec. 20, 1995, by a 3-2 vote. Voting yes were Daniel W. Fessler, P. 
Gregory Conlon and Henry Duque. Voting no were Jessie Knight Jr. and Josiah 
Neeper. All five were appointees of Gov. Pete Wilson. 
WEPEX
Following the PUC vote, a revolving set of the dozen or so members of the 
Western Power Exchange Steering Committee met at airport hotels up and down 
the state to discuss the logistics of deregulation. Members included 
representatives of the major utilities, such as PG&E, San Diego Gas & 
Electric, Southern California Edison and SMUD. Also represented were power 
regulators, such as the PUC and the Energy Commission, and a number of energy 
providers, marketers and users, ranging from the Independent Energy Producers 
to the California Large Energy Consumers Association (CLECA). 
California Legislature
On Aug. 30, 1996, the state Assembly took the first vote on AB 1890, the 
deregulation bill. Approval was unanimous, 77-0. The state Senate voted 39-0 
the following day. The bill was signed by Wilson on Sept. 23. 
FERC
A key vote by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission was interim approval 
for operation of California's bifurcated grid operation - the Power Exchange 
and the Independent System Operator - taken on Oct. 29, 1997. The three 
members at that time, who approved it unanimously, were Vicky A. Bailey, a 
Republican, and Democrats James J. Hoecker and William L. Massey. 
In their words
"Competition will work to drive costs down."
- John Bryson, head of Southern California Edison. From June 14, 1994, PUC 
hearing in Los Angeles. 
"A mandated pool structure would make it easier for big players to dominate 
and manipulate the generation market."
- PUC Commissioner Jessie Knight Jr., warning that his colleagues were 
creating an unworkable system, May 24, 1995. 
"We've pulled the plug on another outdated monopoly and replaced it with the 
promise of a new era of competition."
- Gov. Pete Wilson, signing the Legislature's deregulation bill in San Diego, 
Sept. 23, 1996. 
"California is, as usual, in the vanguard of change. I believe it will not be 
long before virtually all United States energy consumers will have this 
opportunity."
- PG&E CEO Robert Glynn Jr., speaking about the benefits of deregulation to 
the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco on Oct. 24, 1997. 
"All of us saw those numbers and realized that ? there was nothing to stop 
someone from bidding infinity."
- Independent System Operator CEO Jeffrey Tranen, recounting a sudden spike 
in one of ISO's side markets to $5,000 a megawatt hour, July 9, 1998. 
--Bee metro staff 

A consultant for the utility prepared a document describing how the new 
electricity market would hamstring the people in charge of making sure the 
state had enough electricity, and that the cumbersome system would drive up 
electricity costs. 
On June 28, 1996, the utility filed a 71-page statement with federal 
officials explaining its opposition to the market structure supported by the 
state's other large, publicly traded utilities, Southern California Edison 
and Pacific Gas and Electric Co. 
But the FERC, which had to approve any change in California's market, never 
considered the statement. SDG&E withdrew its comments under pressure from 
then-Gov. Pete Wilson's office and others. 
"Officially, (those comments) don't exist," said John Chandley, a 20-year 
veteran of the California Energy Commission. "You read those comments, and 
it's a roadmap of what happened." 
It was hardly the only map available. 
The California Municipal Utilities Association issued a similar warning in 
1996. The Public Utilities Commission cautioned legislators that a power 
shortage could drive prices up in the new market, although the PUC then 
turned around and predicted that would never happen. 
A 1998 utility industry journal outlined ways to manipulate or "game" the 
markets; and only three months after deregulation began, someone was able to 
drive up the cost of a megawatt of electricity from $1 to $5,000 in a matter 
of hours. 
The system was so flawed that a dentist on an airplane figured it out using a 
pen and a cocktail napkin. 
An unstoppable concept
Texas state Sen. David Sibley came to California in January 1998 to visit 
with energy officials in preparation for moving his state toward 
deregulation. 
Yet something about California's new market perplexed him, and on the flight 
home he started doodling. 
"We got a napkin, and it looked like you could game the power exchange," said 
Sibley. "We had our (PUC) guy and our staff and people just started talking 
about how you could figure out how to withhold just enough electricity. We 
were just kind of toying with it, kind of war games things on the airplane." 
"Now, I'm a dentist," Sibley said, "and if I could figure it out, it seemed 
like someone else could, too." 
Once California joined the rush to deregulate, however, it became 
unstoppable. 
The airlines had been deregulated, and airfares had gone down. The natural 
gas industry had been freed up, and rates had dropped. Telephone deregulation 
had spawned entire new industries. 
Electricity was the next obvious target, and California politicians were 
under pressure from the state's largest manufacturers to do something -- 
anything -- to give them a break. 
California was under siege in 1992. The recession and massive cutbacks in 
military spending in California had hobbled the state's economy. The state's 
power troubles were noted in the 1992 Ueberroth Report, a study on the 
state's economic competitiveness headed by millionaire Peter Ueberroth, the 
former baseball commissioner and Olympics czar. 
Energy costs were among the highest in the nation, and steel manufacturers 
and other heavy industrial companies were clamoring for cheaper power. 
Years of lobbying and millions of dollars in political contributions from 
energy firms had softened resistance. Among those pushing was Enron Corp., a 
Houston-based natural gas marketer nosing its way into the $200 
billion-a-year electricity business. 
In the mid-1990s, Enron was aggressively hopscotching from state to state, 
urging deregulation and offering money and promises. 
The company pushed for opening up markets in Iowa and Michigan, priming 
politicians there with contributions. In 1997, it doled out more than 
$858,000 in soft money and political-action contributions to members of 
Congress, becoming the largest contributor from the energy industry. That 
year it hired Ralph Reed, the former head of the Christian Coalition, to 
preach its agenda. 
At the time, Enron was a comparatively small ($8 billion a year in revenue) 
marketer of natural gas. But it was on its way toward becoming one of the 
world's most successful companies, a $100-billion-a-year giant that counts 
President Bush among its friends. 
Enron had qualms about the system California was leaning toward. In testimony 
before the PUC in June 1994, it warned that the highly centralized market 
structure could lead to higher prices. 
But ultimately the company joined the chorus urging California to plunge 
ahead. Enron executive Jeffrey Skilling told the PUC in 1994 that California 
could lower its $23 billion-a-year energy bills by as much as $9 billion -- 
enough money to triple the police forces of its largest cities. 
"Commissioners, the patient is on the ground bleeding," Skilling testified. 
"Delay kills." 
The color books
As California's recession deepened, Wilson's approval rating plummeted, and 
aides fretted about an economic snowball effect. 
Wilson settled on a rescue plan -- full deregulation -- and appointed members 
to the PUC who shared his free-market leanings. Three PUC staffers set things 
into motion in February 1993 with the release of a 200-page report declaring 
that change was needed. 
That report, nicknamed the "Yellow Book" for its cover, declared that the 
century-old system was "ill-suited to govern today's electric industry." 
Consumers would benefit from a change, the report concluded. Slightly more 
than a year later, the PUC commissioners formalized their staffers' 
conclusions in a report dubbed the "Blue Book." 
The Blue Book outlined a tentative plan for opening up the energy 
marketplace. Instead of guaranteeing the utilities a monopoly and capping 
their rates, California would become one of the first states to let customers 
choose their electricity provider while letting rates float. 
By January 2002, the PUC envisioned, every Californian would shop for 
electricity the way people shop for long distance telephone service. 
The book hit with the force of an earthquake, according to one consultant. 
Markets tanked as investors dumped energy stocks out of fear that competition 
meant the staid but stable utilities would be shredded by nimble new 
competitors. 
"The barbarians were at the gates," said Tom Willoughby, a retired PG&E 
lobbyist. 
Those barbarians wanted more. Enron and other out-of-state power companies, 
backed by consumer groups, told policy-makers that in order for everyone to 
have a fair chance at attracting customers, the three big utilities had to be 
defanged. 
Their proposed remedy: Make them sell off most of their power plants. 
Faced with this assault, the utilities set their own ground rules. They would 
break up their monopolies if the state let them charge customers for 
"stranded costs" -- debts from nuclear power projects and other costs they 
believed they'd eat in a competitive market. Wilson, who'd collected $120,000 
in campaign contributions from the utilities, agreed that the utilities 
should collect $16 billion in stranded costs from ratepayers. 
With that, the utilities became enthusiastic backers of deregulation. 
"Competition will work to drive costs down," John Bryson, Edison's chairman, 
told commissioners at their June 1994 hearing. 
Behind the scenes, Edison was working to make sure it was the right kind of 
competition. 
Edison and the San Diego utility settled on a system where utilities would 
buy their power from a centralized "pool" of electricity. They and others hit 
upon the idea of a high-powered field trip. 
In March 1994, the California Foundation for the Environment and the Economy, 
a utility-backed group, sent PUC members, lawmakers and utility executives to 
the United Kingdom to see a pool in action. 
During a weeklong, dawn-to-dusk blitz, the Californians toured power plants 
and utility offices and visited the crown jewel of the U.K. system: the 
National Grid, a kind of stock exchange through which every electron in 
England and Wales was bought and sold. 
The Californians came away impressed by the Grid and its disciplined trading 
system. 
"You just wring out the inefficiencies through the bidding," Conlon recalled. 
"It just kept driving the rates down." 
The compromise
Gov. Pete Wilson was puffed up with pride on Sept. 23, 1996. It was a sunny 
San Diego day, and Wilson was there to baptize one of his offspring: a bill 
to deregulate California's electricity markets. 
"What we are doing is more than signing a new law," Wilson said at the 
signing ceremony. "We are shifting the balance of power in California." 
That balance had begun to tip a year earlier, when Wilson and his top aides 
stepped in to speed things up. 
Edison and PG&E were squabbling over details of the new market, and 
deregulation seemed to be stalled. PG&E was objecting to the "pool" system, 
which it thought would stifle competition. Instead, PG&E favored a more 
free-market approach that would let the utilities buy power from whomever 
they wanted. 
Wilson's own attention was more focused on the possibility of running for 
president and the throat problems that temporarily stole his speaking voice 
-- and his ability to campaign. 
But his staff worked to hammer out an agreement with the utilities, the 
California Manufacturers Association, energy marketers and others. 
"CMA had access to the governor's office day-to-day," recalled Eric Woychik, 
who was acting as an adviser to consumer groups. "We made jokes about how 
they had their own office in the governor's office." 
In the end, Wilson and his aides made a Solomon-like decision. They cut the 
baby in half. Instead of a completely free-market system, they agreed to a 
centralized pool for buying and selling power but also allowed buyers and 
sellers to cut their own, independent power deals. 
The pool would be further split in two: Most of the state's electricity would 
be traded on something called the California Power Exchange. Another entity, 
called the Independent System Operator, would manage the state's transmission 
grid and buy last-minute power to balance supply and demand. 
Divvying up the pool was crucial to the deal, said George Dunn, then Wilson's 
chief of staff, because it lessened the utilities' clout by ending their 
stranglehold on the grid. 
Nowadays, Wilson concedes the setup "was not a perfect free-market 
institution," but at the time it seemed like the only workable compromise. In 
December 1995, the PUC approved deregulation by a 3-2 vote, putting most of 
the major elements into place. 
The state's big utilities would be directed to sell off many of their power 
plants. Individual customers, ranging from businesses to homeowners, could go 
outside the Power Exchange to buy their electricity. But the three big 
utilities had to rely on the exchange to purchase their electricity. 
Most of the commissioners, all Wilson appointees, were sure that having the 
utilities buy electricity on a daily basis would produce panic selling by the 
power generators. 
And prices would drop like stones in a lake. 
No dissent allowed
Not everyone was so sure. Officials with San Diego Gas & Electric believed 
that the rules governing the pool were cumbersome, prone to secrecy and 
inefficiency. 
Some analysts even suggested the power generators and energy marketing firms 
would be able to play one organization off the other -- holding back 
electricity from the Power Exchange, then selling to the ISO at the last 
minute, when prices peaked. 
But they were having trouble making themselves heard. 
For months following the PUC's December 1995 vote, a group consisting of 
utilities, government regulators, energy marketers and industrial and 
commercial users had participated in a series of talks aimed at ironing out 
the details of deregulation. 
These coffee-and-doughnut sessions of the Western Power Exchange Steering 
Committee were theoretically open to the public, but keeping track of them 
was complicated because they rotated among airport hotels from San Francisco 
to Riverside. 
At one of the first meetings, Woychik, who had been sent by consumer groups, 
says he was told by the chairman that he was not welcome: The other members 
had voted against seating him. Others involved confirmed the recollections of 
Woychik, who was already known as a critic of the proposed electricity 
market. 
The pressure was on to present a united front. But Woychik still struggled to 
air his concerns. 
In January 1996, he told a conference of federal regulators that some parts 
of the proposed electricity market "are invitations to classic gaming." 
He elaborated the next month, writing to the Western Power Exchange that, for 
savvy operators, gaming the market "should be like shooting fish in a barrel 
-- not great sport, but lucrative." 
Later, in a January 1998 trade journal article, Woychik described in detail 
four major "games" that could be played in the newly minted California 
electricity market. One involved generators saying their plants were down 
during times of peak demand to drive up prices -- a prophecy many believe 
came true last year. 
Deregulation had lots of cheerleaders. But Woychik was not the only one 
raising red flags. 
In a July 2, 1996, letter to the Legislature, even the PUC acknowledged that 
in times of shortage, market manipulation would be a danger. But the PUC 
predicted that such shortages wouldn't occur, and excess power would keep 
prices down. 
Chandley, meanwhile, had taken up the charge of criticizing the market rules 
at the Western Power Exchange meetings, speaking on behalf of the California 
Energy Commission. 
The Governor's Office was considering whether to let the Energy Commission 
file an official dissent with federal regulators, who had to OK the plan, 
when Chandley set off on a business trip to Massachusetts. Changing planes in 
Dallas, he stopped at a pay phone to check in with his office and got the 
word: Wilson's office had ruled there would be no dissent. 
Within a week, Chandley quit. 
Federal regulators later accepted the California plan. As William Massey, a 
member of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, recalls: "Essentially, we 
deferred to the market plan that was handed us." 
Death march
State lawmakers began taking up deregulation in summer 1996, and a bright, 
ambitious and abrasive Democratic senator from El Cajon named Steve Peace 
found himself at the forefront. Peace announced plans to scrap the PUC plan 
in favor of something better and cheaper. 
Then Wilson stepped in. 
In a letter, the governor made it clear that no tinkering would be tolerated, 
saying he would "oppose any legislation which seeks to alter the decision's 
basic framework or timeline." 
The lawmakers backed off. 
For months they labored over deregulation in a series of late-night 
negotiating sessions that became known as "the Steve Peace death march" -- 
focused almost exclusively on side issues of deregulation. 
Unions made sure that power plant employees got treated fairly. 
Environmentalists got millions in eco-subsidies. Utilities saw to it that 
billions in "stranded costs" would indeed be paid by ratepayers. Ordinary 
consumers got a 10 percent rate cut, and consumer groups largely kept quiet. 
Even Mother Nature nudged lawmakers forward. 
At 2:06 p.m. on a blazing summer day in August 1996, a power line in an 
Oregon forest began to sag until it touched a tree, shorting out the line. 
Over the next two hours, four other lines came into contact with trees. By 4 
p.m. the shorts along the intricate web of power transmission lines caused a 
blackout that affected 4 million people in nine U.S. states stretching from 
Canada to Mexico. 
Experts warned that the electricity system was too fragile, that there had to 
be some sort of backup -- like the ISO -- to protect the grid, some kind of 
independent organization standing ready to keep the lights on at all costs. 
The legislation passed unanimously, Wilson signed it and deregulation was set 
in motion. The utilities, directed by the PUC to start selling their power 
plants to establish a free market, went at it with gusto. 
PG&E sold its plants for $1.5 billion, far more than the book value of $981 
million. Southern California Edison got nearly $1.2 billion for plants valued 
at $677 million. 
Power generators ended up spending most of their capital buying those old 
plants instead of building new ones. Dunn, Wilson's former chief of staff, 
now sees that as an unanticipated flaw: "It was investment that didn't 
generate new electrons." 
Light-bulb cakes, free power
On March 31, 1998, more than seven years after the PUC started the process 
with publication of the "Yellow Book," California's deregulated energy market 
was open for business. 
Alhambra was home to the new Power Exchange, the state-mandated market where 
most electricity would be bought and sold. 
Up north, in Folsom, was its partner: the Independent System Operator, which 
was already buying extra power to make certain California had all the 
electricity it needed. 
On the first full day of deregulation, ISO officials celebrated with a 
light-bulb shaped cake. Brochures boasted of "Securing Reliability" and 
"Power to the people and by the people." 
The system worked beautifully. 
Competition among providers drove power prices so low that PG&E gave away 
electricity for free between 1 a.m. and 2 a.m. that day. The biggest problem 
seen on the horizon was for consumers who would have to pick among a dizzying 
array of cut-rate power providers. 
It would be three months before the party ended, when a worker inside the ISO 
offices in Folsom noticed something terribly wrong. 
The game
Tucked into a leafy office park in Folsom, the ISO consists of a labyrinth of 
hallways and meeting rooms. Ground zero is a 15,000-square-foot control room 
with a giant map board curving across one wall that charts the flow of 
electrons around the state. 
In the foreground, somber-looking people sit in front of computers, talking 
on telephones. Their job is to buy enough power to keep California's needs 
met. 
On July 9, 1998, the price for reserve power needed by the ISO was running at 
$1 a megawatt hour and was being tracked on computer screens in the market 
operations department of the agency. 
A staffer hurried up to ISO chief executive Jeffrey Tranen with a note. The 
$1 price tag, set by the power generators, had shot up to $2,500. Then, just 
as suddenly, it spiked again to $5,000, where it stayed for three hours. 
After that, it mysteriously dropped again, all the way back to $1. 
Four days later it happened again, but this time the price went to $9,999 and 
stayed there for four hours. Then it dropped to a penny. 
"All of us saw those numbers and realized ... there was nothing to stop 
someone from bidding infinity," said Tranen, now a software executive. 
Under the rules, the identities of power generators are kept secret. But 
Levin, the New York businessman who'd warned of higher prices back in 1994, 
said the price spikes were clear signs of someone probing for weak spots. 
"They were experimenting from Year One," he said. "Early on, people learned 
how to work the magic." 
The ISO saw the problem, too, and moved to cap prices. But it was clear that 
California markets were vulnerable to manipulation. The damage was done, and 
the gold rush was on.

Heat wave spawns statewide blackouts 



Year's first scorcher drains system; plugs pulled on 225,000
By Karen Kucher 
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER 
May 8, 2001 
Despite conservation and voluntary shutdowns, the first heat of the season 
meant blackouts for thousands across the state yesterday. 
Power grid managers said the hot spell pushed demand beyond available power 
supplies shortly before 5 p.m., requiring about 300 megawatts to be cut off 
for about an hour. 
The outages affected about 225,000 customers statewide, including about 8,600 
in San Diego and south Orange counties, and provided a glimpse of what the 
next few months could be like in California. Yesterday's blackouts were the 
first since March. 

All day, the state's electricity grid had been stretched to the limit. Demand 
jumped as consumers around the state switched on air conditioning, as 
record-breaking temperatures were recorded in Northern California. The 
temperature reached 93 degrees in San Francisco. More hot weather is forecast 
for today. 
On a day when the peak demand was 33,300 megawatts, about 12,500 megawatts 
were unavailable because of scheduled maintenance work or breakdowns at 
generating plants. Repair work on a natural gas line in Ventura also put one 
power plant temporarily out of commission. 
Around 11 a.m., grid operators came within 500 megawatts of ordering rolling 
blackouts in the state, but pulled back when usage dropped, said Jim 
McIntosh, director of operations for the California Independent System 
Operator, which manages most of the state power grid. 
McIntosh said consumers and "interruptible" businesses allowed their power to 
be shut off for part of the day, an agreement they have made in exchange for 
cheaper power. 
But under the contracts signed with utility companies, those businesses can 
only be interrupted for up to six hours a day. So when those customers came 
back on line in the afternoon, demand soared and outstripped supplies. 
"When that load was restored, as far as I can tell, they were not able to 
recover additional load to cover it," said Michelle Mueller, a San Diego Gas 
& Electric spokeswoman. 
ISO spokeswoman Stephanie McCorkle said power demand was about 2,000 
megawatts higher than grid managers had forecast because of the record-high 
temperatures. 
"With the interruptibles, we can only call on them for a certain length of 
time," she said. "Those were being restored at the same time the temperatures 
continued to soar late in the day and people were coming home to warm houses 
and switching on the air conditioning. We had higher demand the same time we 
had less generation." 
At 4:36 p.m., the ISO ordered the megawatts to be dropped. SDG&E's portion 
was 25 megawatts. Pacific Gas and Electric shed 125 megawatts in Northern and 
Central California. Southern California Edison dropped 150 megawatts, while 
the Sacramento Municipal Utility District cut 18 megawatts. 
Within three minutes of the order, SDG&E cut power to parts of El Cajon, Mira 
Mesa, Torrey Pines and La Jolla. Blackouts also affected SDG&E customers in 
several south Orange County communities. 
Early in the day, SDG&E staff had gathered in the company's emergency 
operations center in Kearny Mesa and had called selected customers, such as 
those on life-support equipment and police and fire agencies, to warn of 
possible blackouts. 
"It is such a dynamic situation," said SDG&E spokeswoman Laura Farmer. "It 
didn't look as bad, and then as the afternoon progressed it started looking 
more and more bleak, and then the ISO decided that they needed to call a 
Stage 3." 
The blackouts apparently created few problems in the region. 
Power went out in the La Jolla Executive Tower, but the outage had little 
impact on Barry Demchak, who runs Torrey Pines Software Inc. 
He and his staff ran their computers on battery power and continued working, 
designing software. 
"The sun comes through the windows. We have no real power needs," he said. 
"If the power goes off here for six or eight hours, we could care less." 
El Cajon lost electricity at several intersections, but police received 
reports of outages lasting only 10 to 15 minutes. 
"Those blackouts did not last an hour," said El Cajon police Sgt. Chuck 
Merino. "They can say what they want. By the time we showed up, it's like 
everything's fine." 
However, a SDG&E spokeswoman said the outages could not have ended that 
quickly. She could not explain the discrepancy. 
In Ramona, a Sizzler restaurant was forced to close its doors during one of 
the busiest times of the day -- from 5 p.m. to 6 p.m. 
"We count on that hour," said manager Amy Krueger. "It impacts us quite a 
bit." 
She posted a sign on the steakhouse doors saying it would reopen when the 
power was restored. But several families arrived for dinner while the 
restaurant was closed. 
"We have a lot of regular customers that come on Monday nights and we had to 
turn them away," she said.

Bond clears Assembly with a partisan twist 




By Ed Mendel 
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER 
May 8, 2001 
SACRAMENTO -- The Assembly approved a $13.4 billion bond needed to repay the 
state general fund for power purchases yesterday, but Republicans who want to 
use the state surplus to aid ratepayers prevented the measure from taking 
effect until August. 
Democrats said they are working on a backup plan to borrow money before the 
new state fiscal year begins on July 1. But Republicans, whose approval also 
may be needed for the new plan, said the state budget and a solution to the 
electricity crisis should be linked. 
Gov. Gray Davis issued a statement sharply criticizing Republicans several 
hours before the vote, when it became clear that the minority party would 
continue to insist that the bond be lowered to $8 billion by using the state 
surplus to pay for some of the power. 
"The Republican Party that brought us this disastrous energy deregulation 
scheme is now obstructing its solution," Davis said. "Their decision to play 
partisan politics with the energy crisis seriously complicates the budget 
process and could ultimately threaten our economy." 
Democrats warned that failure to repay the general fund was a risky gamble 
that could endanger programs and prevent the investments in education and 
other public services needed to preserve a prosperous economy. 
Republicans complained that the state general fund has soared from $45 
billion to nearly $81 billion in the last six years and that Democrats want 
to burden future generations with more debt. 
"Let me tell you what our caucus philosophy is," said Tony Strickland, 
R-Thousand Oaks. "If you have money today, you don't borrow against your 
children and grandchildren's future." 
Democrats passed the measure on a near party-line majority vote, 49-29, after 
Republicans refused to provide the handful of votes needed for a 54-vote 
urgency bill that would take effect immediately when passed by the Senate and 
signed by the governor. 
The measure, which was passed in a special session on energy, could not take 
effect until 90 days after the special session is adjourned. Bills passed by 
a majority vote in a regular legislative session do not take effect until the 
following Jan. 1. 
The current special session could be adjourned this week if the bill is 
swiftly passed by the Senate and signed by Davis. Dozens of bills dealing 
with conservation and obtaining more power would be stranded, but they could 
be reintroduced if Davis called a new special session. 
All five Republicans representing parts of San Diego County voted against the 
bill: Patricia Bates, Laguna Niguel; Dennis Hollingsworth, Temecula; Jay La 
Suer, La Mesa; Mark Wyland, Escondido; and Charlene Zettel, San Diego. All 
three San Diego Democrats voted for the bill: Christine Kehoe, Juan Vargas 
and Howard Wayne. 
In January, legislation was enacted that authorizes the state to issue a bond 
to repay the state general fund for power purchases. The estimate then was 
that the bond would be $10 billion, the largest municipal bond in the history 
of the nation. 
Democrats said new legislation is needed because a state Public Utilities 
Commission action giving the state part of the revenue from monthly ratepayer 
bills was challenged by Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California 
Edison. The utilities say they need a larger share of the ratepayer revenue. 
The state began buying power for utility customers in January after PG&E and 
Edison, whose rates were frozen under deregulation as wholesale power costs 
soared, ran up a debt of $13 billion and were unable to borrow. 
The state has spent about $6 billion so far, and some fear that spending 
could sharply increase this summer as the demand for power increases. The 
bond would repay the state general fund and also begin paying for some 
long-term contracts that will lower the cost of power in the months ahead. 
Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, said the new legislation caps the 
size of the bond at $13.4 billion, reflecting the formula in the January bill 
that limited the size of the bond to four times the annual ratepayer revenue 
received by the state. 
Keeley said a new provision in the bill also would prevent the state general 
fund from paying for power after Nov. 15 this year, with the exception of a 
$500 million loan if needed. 
State Treasurer Phil Angelides had pushed for approval of the bond 
legislation as an urgency measure by today, when commitments from lenders for 
a $4.1 billion short-term "bridge" loan expire. Angelides said the bridge 
loan would help the state prepare a new budget and pave the way for the 
larger bond later. 
"There can't be a bridge loan under these circumstances," Keeley said after 
the vote yesterday. 
Some of the long-term power contracts obtained by the state have a provision 
allowing generators to cancel the contracts if the bond to repay the state is 
not issued by July 1. 
Keeley said Democratic legislative leaders are working on a plan to solve the 
contract problem and allow the state to borrow money before August. He 
refused to reveal details, but said that Republican votes may be needed for 
the new plan. 
Assembly GOP Leader Dave Cox of Fair Oaks said Democrats have not discussed 
the new plan with him. He said any plan should involve the state budget and a 
comprehensive solution that spells out a clear end to the electricity crisis. 
In other developments: 
?Enron Corp., which was ordered last month to honor its contracts to supply 
power to California's public universities, has won a key appellate ruling 
that could cost taxpayers millions. A federal appeals panel in San Francisco 
said Enron could buy power for the universities from the state's 
investor-owned utilities, rather than buying it on the expensive "spot" power 
market. Enron says it would save $12 million a month. But it means the state 
will have to spend more money. 
?California would impose a 100 percent "windfall profits tax" on high-priced 
electricity if a bill approved by the Senate yesterday becomes law. The bill, 
which now goes to the Assembly, would impose the tax on any power priced over 
$80 per megawatt-hour -- a fraction of what electricity has sometimes sold 
for in recent months.

Refinery merger could raise California gas prices 




ASSOCIATED PRESS 
May 8, 2001 
SAN ANTONIO ) Valero Energy Corp. is buying rival Ultramar Diamond Shamrock 
Corp. for about $4 billion in cash and stock in a deal that will make Valero 
the second-largest U.S. refiner of petroleum products. 
The deal announced Monday was approved by both companies' boards over the 
weekend. It still must be approved by company shareholders and regulators. 
The new organization will have $32 billion in annual revenue, more than $10 
billion in assets, 23,000 employees in the United States and Canada and 13 
refineries. Valero will also be one of the nation's largest retailers with 
more than 5,000 retail outlets in the United States and Canada. 
Valero said acquiring Ultramar Diamond Shamrock will make it second only to 
Irving, Texas-based Exxon Mobil Corp. in refining capacity. 
"We're combining the two best independent refining and marketing companies to 
make the premier refiner and marketer in the U.S.," Bill Greehey, Valero's 
chairman of the board and CEO, said in a statement. 
Both companies are based in San Antonio, and between them own three 
California refineries that account for about 353,500 barrels per day of 
processing capacity, or nearly 19 percent of the state's total. 
Rob Schlichting, a spokesman with the California Energy Commission, said 
either Valero or Ultramar likely will be required to sell one of the two San 
Francisco Bay area refineries ) located in Martinez and Benicia ) to win 
regulatory approval. The third refinery is in Wilmington. 
The merger makes California's refining market more concentrated, said Mark 
Cooper, director of research with the Consumer Federation. 
"You've got people complaining about rising gasoline prices," Cooper said. 
"We think one of the reasons is not enough competition, and here you're 
losing more competition. We got into this mess because people wouldn't stop 
enough mergers." 
Valero spokeswoman Joanna Weidman said the merger would actually encourage 
competition. Cost-cutting measures should streamline operations and allow the 
companies to compete more effectively and benefit the consumer down the line, 
Weidman said. 
Valero will pay 1.228 shares of Valero common stock for about half of the 
outstanding shares of Ultramar Diamond Shamrock common stock, and $55 in cash 
per share for the remaining shares. 
That represents a 29 percent premium over Ultramar's closing price of $42.71 
a share on Friday. Valero finished last week at $45.47 a share. 
Valero will also assume $2 billion in Ultramar debt as part of the deal. 
Greehey said Valero's refining system will benefit from combining with the 
Ultramar refining, logistics and retail network. Seven Ultramar refineries, 
with a combined capacity of 850,000 barrels per day, will expand Valero's 
presence in Texas and California and give it a new presence in Colorado, 
Oklahoma and Quebec, Canada. 







Enron could supply universities with state-subsidized power 




By David Kravets
ASSOCIATED PRESS 
May 8, 2001 
SAN FRANCISCO ) Enron Corp., which was ordered last month to honor its 
contracts to supply power to California's public universities, has won a key 
appellate ruling that could cost taxpayers millions. 
A federal appeals panel said the Houston-based energy wholesaler could buy 
power for the universities from the state's investor-owned utilities, rather 
than buying it on the expensive "spot" power market. 
Enron says it would save the company $12 million a month. But it means the 
state will have to spend more money buying electricity to supply the 
universities. Since January, California has already spent $5 billion buying 
electricity for the customers of three ailing utilities that will eventually 
be repaid by customers and taxpayers. 
In its Thursday ruling that was made public Monday, the 9th U.S. Circuit 
Court of Appeals overturned a federal judge's April decision that ordered 
Enron to directly supply power to most of the state's universities as part of 
a long-term agreement with them that expires in March. 
Where Enron buys that power makes a huge financial difference to the state 
under California's power deregulation rules. 
The state said it could spend ) or Enron could save ) up to $12 million 
dollars a month. That's because buying last-minute power on the spot market, 
where Enron had been buying the schools' power, costs several times more than 
what the state can legally collect from ratepayers. 
Since January, the state has bought electricity for the customers of Pacific 
Gas and Electric Co., Southern California Edison Co. and San Diego Gas and 
Electric Co. in an attempt to keep them financially stable as power prices 
skyrocketed. 
The state has only been able to retrieve $1 billion from customers of the $5 
billion it has spent on electricity buys, said Nathan Barankin, a spokesman 
with the attorney general. 
The state said it would ask the court to reconsider its supply decision. The 
ruling, Barankin said, "allows Enron to perpetuate its scam on California's 
taxpayers." 
That's a position Enron vehemently denies. 
"We believe, under the way the contract is written, it gives us the right to 
supply the power or have somebody else source the power for us, such as the 
utilities," said Enron spokeswoman Peggy Mahoney. 
Enron convinced the appeals panel that it should not have to purchase power 
on the spot market to honor its contract, and instead can make good on its 
cheap power contract by buying it from the utilities. 
That means Enron will pay substantially less for the electricity through the 
utilities and will reimburse the universities for possible charges that 
exceed the contracted price with Enron. 
Electricity sold through the utilities is capped under California law and 
does not reflect the true cost of the power. Billions of dollars of 
undercollected costs is among the main reasons PG&E filed for federal 
bankruptcy protection early last month. 
The case is UC Regents v. Enron Energy Systems Inc., 01-1006.

EDISON'S AGONY
For CEO, Life in 'Foxhole' Means Little Sleep, Peace 
Utilities: Plans go awry, strategies collapse as John Bryson struggles to 
fend off bankruptcy. 

By NANCY CLEELAND, Times Staff Writer 

?????John E. Bryson, chief executive of Edison International, never imagined 
his charmed life would come to this: working 16-hour days. Laying off 
employees. Swallowing his pride and begging for regulatory relief.
?????It's early January and the heart of his company--the Southern California 
Edison electric utility--is going down like an old battered ship. No one will 
help him save it. Once-trusting consumers think Bryson is greedy. Legislators 
are confused. The governor seems distant. Some of his own people wonder 
whether Bryson is up to the task.

company with firm Vice President Tom Higgins.

?????Bankruptcy looms like a dark hole of shame. Bryson decides, with his 
board of directors, to do whatever he can to avoid it. He will try to salvage 
Edison through political compromise, to cajole and negotiate and plead. The 
decision means that in the coming months he will have to make awful 
concessions, allow himself to be humiliated and often hold his tongue. He 
will do this out of the conviction that it is the only way to save hundreds 
of Edison jobs, the retirement income of thousands of small investors and the 
very economy of California. 
?????He came to Edison almost incidentally 17 years ago, an outsider, the 
model of a new, environmentally sensitive energy executive. As 2001 dawns he 
is poised to go down in history as a bungler, the man who led a solid, 
century-old utility into ruin. Such a legacy is unthinkable, but as he runs 
from it, he embarks on a tortuous slide of disappointment.
?????Today, four months after the crisis hit public consciousness, there's 
still a chance that Bryson will work out a political solution. But it's a 
thin one, and it has come at a very high price.

?????January: Hope, Then Failure
?????Edison is several billion dollars in debt and losing millions more each 
day as electricity prices soar. Banks cut off credit. Blackouts are 
threatened across California. Bryson's mood is one of astonishment: How can 
government regulators let it go this far? Why won't someone step in? Then, in 
the waning days of the Clinton administration, he is called to a White House 
summit.
?????California Gov. Gray Davis, who refused to meet Bryson earlier to 
address the crisis, is there. So are the electricity wholesalers accused of 
price gouging. After weeks of blaming one another, all sides have finally 
come to Washington to look for solutions. Bryson is hopeful. Everyone, he 
says, takes the high road.
?????A vague plan is hatched: The state will jump in to buy wholesale 
electricity. Suppliers will sign cheaper long-term contracts. Edison and 
Pacific Gas & Electric, the troubled San Francisco utility, will pay off 
their debts through a state-backed bond issue, regain credit-worthiness and 
eventually return to normal business.
?????Back at Rosemead headquarters the next day, running on cold coffee, 
Bryson and a handful of Edison lawyers, engineers and money managers fill in 
the details. They go without sleep and call co-workers out of bed to ask them 
the rate at which transmission lines lose electrons.
?????By the afternoon of Jan. 12, three days after the summit, the plan is 
solid enough to talk about publicly.
?????"I'm very optimistic," Bryson declares, relieved that the crisis has 
been addressed at last. "We'll know whether or not this works in the next two 
to three weeks."
?????It won't.
?????A week later, President Bush, decidedly less fond of federal 
intervention, is inaugurated, and the goodwill generated in Washington 
evaporates. Energy prices climb even higher in California. Meanwhile, Davis 
plans an auction for long-term energy contracts that he swears will bring 
prices down. So much for a simple fix.

?????Insult to Injury
?????The following weeks bring showers of bad news. Edison defaults on loans, 
suspends dividends and forces some of its largest business customers to cut 
power. Several times, the utility comes within a hair of rolling outages.
?????Bryson laments the lack of progress. He can't understand why the tone in 
Sacramento has turned so hostile, why Edison is painted as a villain when 
faulty state regulations created this mess. This is a private company, he 
says, over and over. The state cannot force it to operate at a loss any more 
than it can force a service station to pump gas below cost.
?????"There's some quality to this whole thing that makes it sound like the 
utilities are supplicants, pleading for help," Bryson says, bewildered. "This 
is our right [to cover costs] and the business doesn't work without it. 
That's the most basic premise."
?????Often seething with anger, he tries to be discreet and diplomatic. The 
route to a deal is too delicate to risk offense. Yet his anger turns to 
outrage Jan. 19 when the state Public Utilities Commission issues an 
aggressive restraining order that compels Edison to continue delivering 
electricity to its customers no matter how much money it loses. There's no 
need for such an order, Bryson complains, and it's an insult to all Edison 
employees to suggest otherwise. 
?????He paces the plush beige carpet outside his office. Edison is entitled 
to cover reasonable costs, he says.
?????"These guys," he says of the PUC members, "are thumbing their noses at 
the law." When a reporter asks a question about PUC Chairwoman Loretta Lynch, 
Bryson nearly rants. 
?????"She's a very negative person," he says, then feels the crack in his 
veneer. With a laugh and wave of his hands, he wipes it away.
?????"Oh no," he says, "I'm not going to go there." He does it with an 
easygoing boyishness that still serves him well at 57, despite the hair 
that's nearly gone white. 
?????Sometimes in this crisis, Bryson appears haggard, unwell. But more 
often, and at the oddest times, he is buoyant, with a half smile that seems 
to be choking back a snort of laughter. It's a disarming affectation, and 
confusing. It makes him seem almost cavalier, almost masking the fact that he 
has turned his life over to solving this crisis.
?????Bryson, the son of an Oregon sawmill operator, graduated from Stanford 
University and went on to Yale Law School in the late 1960s. Bright and 
idealistic, he co-founded the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council, a 
still-thriving environmental protection law firm.
?????He was barely into his 30s when Gov. Jerry Brown appointed him to chair 
the California Water Resources Control Board. Three years later, in 1979, 
Brown made Bryson a member of the PUC. He later practiced law for a while, 
then--through friendships cultivated at the PUC--joined Southern California 
Edison as a vice president. Six years later, he took over the job of the man 
who recruited him, Chief Executive Howard Allen.
?????Life at a regulated utility can be very good, and Edison grew on him. He 
liked the easy pace, the terrific pay ($2.2 million last year). He liked the 
people around him. They were smart, steady, nice. Above all, he liked the 
utility's integrity, its image as a reliable corporate citizen.
?????Life at a deregulated utility would be very different.
?????Edison's rescue plan circulates in Sacramento. To Bryson's great 
annoyance, what he regards as a right to financial survival is being labeled 
a "bailout" by critics. The criticism fuels the idea that if Sacramento 
floats billions in bonds to help Edison pay its debt, the utility should give 
up something valuable. Perhaps its hydroelectric system. Or its transmission 
grid. In a world of populist political rhetoric, the trade-off is sold as "a 
dollar for a hot dog," in the words of Senate Leader John Burton (D-San 
Francisco).
?????To Bryson, these assets are chunks of Edison's soul, designed by Edison 
engineers, built by Edison linemen. They were marvels in their time, proof 
that man could harness nature on a massive scale. How could he give up Big 
Creek--Edison's legendary series of dams and powerhouses deep in the Sierra 
Nevada? That was the first place Bryson called top Edison management together 
when he was named chief executive in 1990 because he wanted to start his term 
with the stamp of history. 
?????Photos of the massive powerhouses hang on his office wall. Bryson walks 
past them, to a bookcase on the far side of his spacious office, and pulls 
out a photo book documenting Big Creek's construction.
?????"Take it," he tells a visitor. "Maybe it will help you understand."
?????Initially, Bryson and other executives say no deal on hydro or the grid. 
Then they waver: maybe, but only at a fair price. But already, Bryson is 
making the mental adjustment, accepting the loss, doing whatever he can to 
stay out of bankruptcy.
?????He is clinging to two hopes. The first is that a state audit will prove 
Edison did nothing wrong, but simply followed the misguided rules that 
abruptly pushed California into a deregulated energy market. The second is 
that Edison will prevail in its lawsuit against the PUC in which it seeks to 
increase electricity rates to cover its ballooning costs.
?????In the end, neither happens. The audit alleges no criminal wrongdoing, 
but is extremely complex and open to interpretation. It does not explicitly 
ask, or answer, whether Edison did anything wrong. The lawsuit fails to 
produce an immediate rate increase, and a trial is years away. Edison's 
stability continues to erode.
?????Bryson has to look hard for a few bright moments. On Jan. 23, he 
receives a letter from shareholder W.R. Cate, a retired telephone company 
manager in Henderson, N.C. He and his wife and children hold 1,500 shares; 
they've lost more than $10,000 in the last month. 
?????"We are behind you," Cate writes. "Bargain hard until you see some 
blood." 
?????Bryson writes back the same day: "Many thanks for your perceptive and 
insightful letter. . . . It was a ray of light and fun. We do intend to 
bargain hard until we see some blood."
?????His job becomes a blur of conference calls, predawn pages and 
last-minute shuttle flights. His world is this Rosemead office, where he 
often settles into a beige armchair and eats his lunch off a cafeteria tray; 
airports, where he boards the Southwest shuttle to or from Sacramento, and 
legislative hallways, where he trolls for allies.
?????The closest thing to a routine is the daily meeting with the inner 
circle. At least once a day, Bryson strides across the plush-carpeted hall to 
a conference room for an update on Edison's latest strategy. To each new idea 
from Sacramento, they respond earnestly, as if it were already law. The next 
day, when a new idea emerges, they do it again. There is something poignant, 
almost comical, watching the cluster of desperate veteran executives trying 
to outguess a new crop of state legislators. 
?????Bryson thinks about the hours he has spent with these men and a few 
women, the wartime atmosphere, and feels grateful.
?????"You're in a foxhole," he says in February. "The question is: Is the 
person beside you right there with you all the way? What I've seen is an 
amazing crew of people. They're creative, really dedicated, determined to 
work it through, and showing good judgment even when stressed. That's the 
little offset to all this."

?????Feb. 7: The Longest Day
?????Bryson wakes up in Sacramento, exhausted with a cold. Negotiations with 
the state are going nowhere. Legislative hearings start in two days. Edison 
wants its side heard, so Bryson has come to the Capitol to talk to reporters 
and seek help from the governor. 
?????He stands at a podium next to Bob Foster, Edison's governmental affairs 
chief, a career employee. Their messages are clear: Bankruptcy is bad. We 
didn't cause this crisis. We have a legal and moral right to cover the costs 
of wholesale electricity. We will only sell our transmission lines if it's a 
fair deal.
?????He is scanning the state's newspapers later when he freezes at an 
editorial in The Times contending that Edison International "milked" its 
utility of essential cash. Not now, he moans. The editorial gives credence to 
an allegation that the parent corporation stole money from its starving 
utility to pay off shareholders.
?????In fact, Bryson insists, the transfer of funds, detailed in the state 
audit, was legal and proper and approved by the PUC. He must clear this up 
before the legislative hearings. He gets on the phone to The Times--where he 
was once a member of the newspaper's corporate board--and begs for an 
audience with the editorial board. He flies south and walks into the building 
that day, carrying a binder full of memos, charts and old audits going back 
five years. He is cordial but insistent. "Milked" is inappropriate, he says. 
It's a word that implies unethical.
?????He is pale from his cold and a little too desperate. He stays more than 
an hour, too long for the editorial writers, who are facing deadlines. 
Please, Bryson insists. Let me read from this 1999 audit that found SCE "more 
than compliant." Just this one page.
?????But his pleas produce no Times editorials reflecting his comments.
?????Two days later, a clear-headed Bryson addresses the Legislature with an 
evocative speech about trust. He laments the rift between utilities and 
regulators, the mutual distrust that has developed.
?????"We find ourselves today treated as an adversary and as an enemy," he 
says. But his defense is forgotten, wiped out by a question from a San Diego 
legislator: Did Southern California Edison overpay millions of dollars in 
taxes to the parent company, Edison International? The implication is that 
Edison International found another way to drain the utility--and, thus, 
ratepayers--of cash.
?????Bryson insists it's not that devious. The PUC required the utility and 
its parent company to figure their taxes separately. SCE paid those taxes to 
the parent. But losses from other subsidiaries lowered Edison International's 
taxes and allowed it to keep some of the SCE money.
?????Did SCE overpay Edison International in taxes? the legislator asks again.
?????It's complicated, Bryson says. But, yes, we did.
?????In mid-February, a federal judge rejects Edison's request to force the 
PUC to immediately increase rates to cover costs. Edison's last ace blows 
away.

?????Feb. 23: The End of the Beginning
?????Stage 3 alerts--the last step before rolling blackouts--have become 
routine. Businesses are screaming about reliability. The state is bleeding 
money trying to continue purchasing power. Davis, his political future at 
stake, is engaged. A framework is announced: Edison agrees to sell its 
transmission grid for less than half of what it wanted. In exchange, a 
portion of rates revenue will be set aside to cover past debt.
?????Bryson has to explain his decision to disheartened employees, many of 
whom helped build the grid and take so much pride in it. He's not even sure 
the agreement will work. "Was it Churchill," he wonders to a reporter, "who 
said something like, 'This is not the end. This is even not the beginning of 
the end. But it may be the end of the beginning'? That may be where we are 
now."
?????He worries about losing employees, about being able to attract good ones 
in the future. He worries about Edison becoming a takeover target. His 
escapes are few.
?????A day after the framework is signed, he sits in an Oxnard high school 
gymnasium, watching his 17-year-old daughter compete in the last game of her 
high school basketball career. Bryson is lost in the energy of the gymnasium, 
grateful for the anonymity of the bleachers. 
?????He and his wife, Louise Henry Bryson, a former documentary filmmaker and 
now television executive, live in San Marino. He dotes on his four daughters. 
The youngest, a still-innocent 12, knows something's wrong at Daddy's work 
but has no idea how bad it is.
?????Small breaks are the way to get through this, he tells himself. He works 
out--aerobics, Pilates, yoga--in a Pasadena gym where no one knows him. His 
chief financial officer, Ted Craver, runs the L.A. Marathon. Counsel Bryant 
Danner takes comfort in drives to Mammoth. Foster and John R. Fielder, a vice 
president for regulatory affairs, take their wives to Hawaii for a week. 
Their timing is horrible.

?????April 6: A Tightening of the Noose
?????While Foster and Fielder are gone, PG&E decides to solve its financial 
crisis by filing for bankruptcy protection. Creditors will now be less timid 
about pulling Edison into court. Bryson figures he has a few days, at most, 
to close a deal with the state, or Edison will go down too.
?????That night, he and Davis meet for more than four hours, refining the 
framework. The Edison team spends all weekend, yet again, filling in the 
details. Monday morning, after five hours of discussion, Edison's directors 
approve a 33-page agreement covering the bond issue, dedicated rate component 
and sale of Edison's transmission lines to the state.
?????It's far from over. The state Legislature must sign off on certain 
parts. Consumers must approve bonds to cover the debt, which will be paid off 
through a small share of rates over some 15 years.
?????And then there are the intangibles: Will people still buy Edison stock? 
Will institutions still lend it money? It will be years before it is clear 
whether Edison's decision to fight bankruptcy is the right one. Bryson's 
humiliation rose last week when Forbes magazine dinged him as No. 7 on its 
list of the nation's "worst-valued" CEOs. But he feels at peace, that he has 
done everything he could do--except, perhaps, talk a little louder, a little 
earlier in the crisis. 
?????"It's probably fair to say that, going all the way back to last summer, 
we could have rung the bell louder," he says, a sadness momentarily replacing 
the boyish chuckle. "We kept thinking we would be be persuasive, and it kept 
not happening. We tried hard, but we didn't succeed."

Power Cut to Parts of State 
Electricity: First blackouts since March may be the beginning of warm-weather 
outages, industry officials warn. 

By MITCHELL LANDSBERG and KAREN ROBINSON-JACOBS, Times Staff Writers 

?????The dreaded summer of 2001 cast its shadow over California on Monday as 
an early spate of hot weather forced an hour of scattered, statewide 
electrical blackouts--a precursor of what could be a difficult season ahead.
?????With more warm weather expected today and tomorrow, state power 
officials warned that more blackouts might be necessary before an expected 
cooling trend later in the week. And they acknowledged that this could be the 
start of a long, dark summer.
?????"I hate to be the bearer of bad news," said Ed Riley, a spokesman for 
the agency that operates the statewide electrical grid, "but yeah, this is 
the start."
?????The blackouts, the first since March, were triggered at 4:45 p.m. after 
a day in which the California Independent System Operator struggled to patch 
together enough electricity to keep the grid running without outages. That 
worked for most of the day, but finally a combination of warm weather and 
power plant outages proved to be too much for the grid jockeys, and they were 
forced to order the hourlong blackouts, which affected about 100,000 
residential, industrial and commercial customers.
?????The customers hit by the outage were those served by the state's three 
largest private utilities--Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison 
and San Diego Gas & Electric--plus a number of people served by municipal 
utilities in Pasadena and Vernon.
?????As has been the case throughout the power crisis, which began last 
summer, customers of the municipally owned Los Angeles Department of Water 
and Power were spared. The DWP operates independently of the statewide grid.
?????State officials have been warning for months that this summer would 
probably bring frequent blackouts. Demand for electricity in California has 
far outstripped the supply, and the state's ability to import power from 
elsewhere in the West has been limited by a drought in the Pacific Northwest, 
which relies heavily on hydroelectricity, and by prices that have soared 
beyond the reach of the private utilities.
?????The heat that triggered Monday's blackouts was far from the hottest that 
can be expected this summer. Temperatures ranged from the 70s along the 
Southern California coast to 80 degrees in downtown Los Angeles, 95 degrees 
in Northridge and Sacramento, and a statewide high of 104 degrees in Palm 
Springs.
?????However, there also were more power plants out of service than officials 
hope will be the case this summer. In all, about 12,500 megawatts of power 
were unavailable, mostly because of planned outages for maintenance. That 
amounts to about one-quarter of the state's peak summer demand for power.
?????California uses more electricity in the summer because air conditioners 
require vast amounts of power. Power officials said the latest blackouts were 
an ominous sign.
?????"This is probably typical of what we'll see this summer, but I would say 
this was a less than full experience," said Dick Rosenblum, Edison senior 
vice president for distribution and transmission.
?????"Here we go," said Michael Zenker, California director of Cambridge 
Energy Research Associates, a Massachusetts energy consulting firm. "This is 
a bad omen for how bad the situation is."
?????Rosenblum said about 34,000 Edison customers lost power during the 
blackouts. They were scattered across Edison's 50,000-square-mile territory, 
and included such communities as Irvine, Barstow, Santa Monica, Long Beach 
and Inglewood, he said.
?????The blackouts also affected about 54,000 PG&E customers scattered 
through Northern and Central California, and about 8,600 customers of SDG&E 
in parts of San Diego and Orange counties.
?????As is typical in such blackouts, the utilities received only a few 
minutes' warning from Cal-ISO before they had to pull the plug.
?????No serious incidents were reported. "People are starting to get the hang 
of this," observed Tustin Police Lt. Mike Shanahan, who said he was 
pleasantly surprised at the ease with which drivers in his Orange County 
community began treating blacked-out signals as four-way stops.
?????The blackouts came slightly more than two hours after Cal-ISO officials 
expressed cautious optimism that they might squeak through the day. Worries 
in the morning had eased when the state received 1,000 megawatts from a 
Canadian supplier, and when "interruptible" customers--those who agree to 
occasionally shut off power in exchange for lower rates--came through when 
asked.
?????Riley guessed that the late-afternoon shortage occurred when the 
interruptible customers turned their power back on. In the past, he said, 
such customers--usually large businesses and institutions--typically quit 
work for the day rather than wait around to turn the power back on.
?????"For some reason today, some of that load came back," Riley said.
?????He said it was difficult to immediately determine the extent to which 
Californians were conserving electricity, and whether poor conservation 
efforts could be blamed for the blackouts.
?????Gov. Gray Davis has been exhorting Californians to conserve energy as 
part of a multi-pronged--and hotly contested--state strategy to cope with 
power shortages and exorbitant prices.
?????On Monday, speaking at a news conference in Los Angeles, Davis thanked 
President Bush "for what he has done to date"--a rare bouquet--but was 
clearly critical of recent comments made by Vice President Dick Cheney that 
energy prices should not be capped or regulated under any circumstances, even 
if the problem threatens the nation's economy.
?????"By far the most important thing that the federal government could do 
for us is to moderate prices, which are staggering," Davis said. He said it 
would be a "grave mistake" for the Bush administration to "rigidly adhere to 
ideology even if it meant hardship for California."
?????Also Monday, Davis said he anticipates that a deal to purchase the 
transmission system of San Diego Gas & Electric "will be resolved before the 
week is out." He has offered more than $7 billion to buy the transmission 
systems of SDG&E, Edison and PG&E. So far, only Edison has accepted the deal. 
PG&E's ability to sell its grid has been complicated, if not thwarted, by the 
company's decision to file for protection in federal Bankruptcy Court.
?????Davis has faced difficulty at every turn attempting to rescue the 
state's electrical system while staying afloat in a political tar pit.
?????The latest setback took shape over the past few days as chief executives 
of several independent power companies turned down the governor's invitation 
to a meeting in his office on Wednesday. Davis had sent out the invitations 
to a dozen chief executives last week. Most responded by offering to send 
lower-ranking officers.
?????Davis has relentlessly attacked independent generators, refusing to let 
up even as he invited them.
?????"I'm going ask these generators, who have made more money than God 
sucking money out of California and taking it back to Texas and other 
Southwest states, to reduce the cost of power for this summer, and to reduce 
the claims they have on us for money the utilities owe," he said.
?????In declining the invitation, Stephen Bergstrom, president and chief 
operating officer of Dynegy Inc. of Houston, wrote: "We are greatly disturbed 
by the increasingly virulent rhetoric that is coming from Sacramento."
?????Also Monday:
?????* Democratic lawmakers announced in Sacramento that they are suing the 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to compel the agency to cap wholesale 
electricity prices. The agency recently ordered a limited cap, but the 
legislators said it was not enough.
?????* The state Senate voted to impose a special tax on the "windfall" 
profits of energy producers whose earnings have soared astronomically during 
the last year. The resulting revenue would be returned to income taxpayers in 
the form of a credit.
?????* Frustrated by a Republican roadblock, Democratic legislators pushed 
forward with a parliamentary maneuver to reimburse the state budget for 
billions in electricity purchases--a last-gasp move that will effectively 
delay repayment until August.

Landlords, Janitors Join in Plan to Save Energy 
Labor: Campaign will include cleaning crews turning out lights in offices on 
their rounds. 

By KAREN ROBINSON-JACOBS , Times Staff Writer 

?????Showing how crisis can unite former adversaries, landlords and janitors 
announced a plan Monday to cut electricity use in major office buildings by 
10% statewide--in part by having cleaning crews turn off lights in offices as 
they make their rounds.
?????Calling it the "largest commercial partnership ever for conservation," 
Gov. Gray Davis hailed the Lights Out plan as part of an overall statewide 
effort to reduce the threat of blackouts this summer.
?????"This is a tremendous partnership between labor and business," said 
Davis, speaking at a news conference in the shadow of the towering Wells 
Fargo Center in downtown Los Angeles, one of the many buildings participating 
in the program. "I challenge all commercial building owners up and down this 
state to do their part."
?????As part of the campaign, cleaning crews will be encouraged to turn off 
lights in unoccupied areas and after cleaning an area. They will also switch 
off other machinery, including computers, and will clean floors in teams, 
rather than be spread out over several floors at the same times, to reduce 
energy consumption.
?????In addition, building owners will be encouraged to seek state-financed 
incentives to offset the cost of installing energy-efficient lighting and 
so-called smart technology, such as motion sensors that shut off the lights 
when a room is not in use.
?????Though tenants will pay most of the cost as energy prices soar, 
landlords have a financial stake in the matter too, said Geoff Ely, president 
of the Building Owners and Managers Assn.
?????As energy use in a building decreases, so do the overall operational 
expenses of the building, making it more attractive to future tenants, he 
said.
?????"In this climate, that could be a significant benefit to the owner," Ely 
said.
?????Ely said the estimate of 10% savings is based on the experience of 
building owners who have implemented similar programs.
?????But if the potential savings are so great, why haven't all building 
owners and tenants begun turning off the lights? According to Ely, many 
owners and tenants simply aren't aware of the savings to be gained. He said 
the new cooperative approach between the landlords and Service Employees 
International Union is part of a broader effort to get more segments of the 
business community involved in conservation. 
?????"We need to work with anyone and everyone who has a role in these 
buildings," Ely said. "The janitors indicated that they wanted to 
participate. This extends beyond management-labor issues and goes to the 
basic issue of the business climate in California."
?????The announcement comes one year after more than 8,000 janitors in Los 
Angeles County let office-building trash pile up during a three-week strike. 
But Mike Garcia, president of SEIU Local 1877, said he and the 25,000 union 
members who clean the major office properties throughout the state were proud 
to be part of the landmark program.
?????"The energy crisis threatens all of us, especially the low-wage 
workers," such as janitors, said Garcia, facing a sea of union members 
sporting green "Lights Out" T-shirts.
?????Noting that a year ago the union was just concluding its work stoppage, 
he said, "Today we stand in solidarity and full cooperation on our five-point 
plan."
?????The program calls for janitors and landlords throughout the state to 
work together to:
?????* Encourage energy-efficient cleaning practices, including switching 
more workers to a Sunday-to-Thursday workweek and establishing janitorial 
"lighting patrols" to shut off unneeded lights.
?????* Implement building-wide conservation programs, seeking input from 
janitors, engineers and other building staffers.
?????* Conduct conservation training seminars for janitors and engineers.
?????* Develop and implement a "comprehensive capital program," offering 
rebates and other state-funded incentives for retrofitting buildings with 
energy-efficient equipment. 
?????* Use newsletters, e-mail and lobby signs to spread the word about the 
program to the 2 million office-building workers.
?????Ely said owners of about 250 million square feet of office space in the 
major markets statewide--including Arden Realty Inc., TrizecHahn Corp., 
Equity Office Properties Trust and MaguirePartners-- have committed to the 
program. In many cases, work to upgrade energy efficiency has begun.
?????He said that represents a "very good chunk" of the estimated 600 million 
square feet of space targeted in the program.
?????Rob Maguire, managing partner of MaguirePartners, which owns the Wells 
Fargo Center, said the bottom-line issue is how the energy crisis will affect 
the state's ability to attract and retain business--a key concern of 
landlords statewide.
?????"At the moment, there is a concern that the state is not competitive," 
Maguire said.

Effort to Repay State for Power Is Delayed 
Crisis: Democrats, GOP fail to agree on a $13-billion emergency bond, putting 
California at risk of running out of funds this fall. 

By MIGUEL BUSTILLO and JULIE TAMAKI, Times Staff Writers 

?????SACRAMENTO--California will not be able to reimburse state coffers the 
billions spent buying electricity during the energy crisis until August at 
the earliest, which will leave the state perilously close to running out of 
money this fall.
?????Democrats and Republicans failed to come to terms Monday on emergency 
legislation that would authorize up to $13.4 billion in bonds to repay the 
state budget, leading Democrats to push forward with a last-gasp strategy.
?????The Legislature's ruling party outflanked the minority GOP by 
introducing an identical, nonemergency measure that required only majority 
approval, not two-thirds passage. It was approved by the Assembly Monday 
evening on a 49-29 vote, and is expected to receive final Senate approval 
Thursday. 
?????Though it guarantees California taxpayers will eventually be repaid in 
full for electricity purchases made to supply private utilities, the 
Democrats' action carries a series of negative consequences for the state as 
it seeks to escape the energy crisis.
?????The nonemergency bill will take a minimum of 90 days to become law after 
the special session ends, effectively leaving the general fund with a massive 
hole as lawmakers prepare the state budget over the next two months.
?????"We can't sell the bonds as quickly, and will probably need a 
contingency budget," said Assemblyman Speaker Pro Tem Fred Keeley (D-Boulder 
Creek).
?????Keeley said lawmakers will probably have to prepare a spending plan with 
different levels of funding--one from July, the time the next fiscal year 
begins, to whenever the bonds are eventually sold. Lawmakers may also have to 
consider a worst-case scenario: the possibility that the bonds will not sell.
?????"If [investors] don't buy the bonds," Keeley said, "the situation we're 
in is very, very dire because the general fund would be repaid very, very 
slowly."
?????State Treasurer Phil Angelides had hoped to borrow $4.13 billion to 
partially repay the budget until bonds could be issued, but lawmakers said 
the new legislation will make that impossible. Angelides' tentative deal to 
borrow the money from several Wall Street firms expires today. The deal 
required authorization on the bonds, because bond proceeds were to be used to 
repay the loan.
?????"The Assembly Republicans' refusal to support emergency legislation puts 
the state's fiscal integrity at great and continuing risk, and does serious 
harm to essential services from education to public safety to health care," 
Angelides said in a statement.
?????The delay also means that Gov. Gray Davis will fail to keep his promise 
to repay the budget and take the state out of the energy buying business by 
the end of June. That is crucial, because many of the contracts to purchase 
electricity that the Davis administration signed contain language that may 
make them void if financing is not secured by July 1. If the contracts 
evaporate, the state will be forced to buy even more power on the expensive 
spot market to avoid blackouts.
?????Davis plans to replenish state coffers and stop using taxpayer money on 
power purchases by floating a record bond issue, which would be repaid by 
utility ratepayers out of their monthly bills. But the bonds cannot be issued 
until the bill in question takes effect.
?????In a statement, Davis also accused Republicans of "obstructing the 
solution" to the state's electricity problems, saying "their decision to play 
partisan politics with the energy crisis seriously complicates the budget 
process and could ultimately threaten our economy."
?????So far this year, California has spent more than $5 billion from the 
budget buying power for the private utilities that were too financially 
strapped to continue doing so.
?????Most critically, the measure will leave a dangerously narrow window of 
time for the bond to be issued so the budget could be reimbursed before state 
coffers begin to run dry in early fall. The $12.5-billion bond is expected to 
be the largest in American history, and experts say it will require a 
significant sales effort. The Democrats' bill authorizes a slightly larger 
amount in case the bond issue needs to grow.
?????Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg (D--Sherman Oaks) said he will continue 
working with Republicans in hopes of passing legislation to authorize the 
bonds sooner.
?????"I'm still holding out an olive branch to Republicans," Hertzberg said.
?????Lastly, the bill's final passage will kill, temporarily at least, 
hundreds of energy-related bills now winding their way through the 
Legislature. That is because, for the bill to become law as quickly as 
possible, Democrats would have to adjourn the current special legislative 
session on the energy crisis.
?????Democrats are vowing to quickly approve a host of important bills this 
week before the session is closed down. And Davis is expected to immediately 
call another special session, said spokesman Steve Maviglio, so most of the 
remaining bills could be reintroduced.
?????Nonetheless, the process would slow down passage of numerous 
measures--especially for Republicans, who may have a harder time getting 
their bills through both houses a second time. Republicans hold only 30 of 
the Assembly's 80 seats, and 14 of the Senate's 40 seats, making them a 
distinct minority.
?????Without question, the Democrats' move represents a ratcheting up of 
partisan politics on the energy crisis.
?????Republicans held up the initial legislation in hopes of forcing Davis 
and his Democratic colleagues to alter their financial plan to get the state 
out of the crisis--even if it meant scaling back the next state budget.
?????Davis has proposed borrowing the $12.5 billion to repay the budget and 
cover future power purchases over the next two years, which would allow his 
next state budget to move forward unimpeded by the crisis.
?????GOP lawmakers, who are convinced that the size of the bond will need to 
be increased to finance Davis' plan, countered last week with a proposal to 
essentially gobble up most of the state's projected surplus by writing off $5 
billion in electricity purchases and borrowing less in bonds for future power 
buys.
?????But Democrats balked at the Republican proposal, saying California had 
far too many needs in education, law enforcement, transportation and health 
care to permanently spend $5 billion on electricity. Furthermore, they said, 
using taxpayer money instead of electric rates to cover power purchases would 
favor big business.
?????"Today, we take a bitter pill to fix a problem we all know needs to be 
fixed," Assemblyman Dennis Cardoza (D-Merced) said.

Blackouts Mean More Than Inconvenience for Disabled 
Energy: They say life-saving equipment could fail. Advocates will urge state 
officials and utilities to provide a stronger safety net. 

By JOHN M. GLIONNA, Times Staff Writer 

?????SAN FRANCISCO--As she monitored the news of possibly more rolling 
blackouts Monday, Lori Gray braced for another tense day in the projected 
summer-long fallout from the state's worsening energy crisis.
?????For the 39-year-old Berkeley woman--who is blind and suffers from 
epilepsy, asthma and chronic pain from aching joints that restrict 
movement--losing electricity is more than just an inconvenience.
?????It could kill her, she says.
?????Gray relies on electricity to run several life-saving machines that do 
everything from dispensing her asthma medication and opening her door by 
remote control to relaying her emergency telephone numbers in a computerized 
voice.
?????Today, disability activists are calling on state officials and 
California's utilities to do more to assist residents like Gray--disabled 
people who are perilously vulnerable to any loss of electrical power.
?????In letters to Gov. Gray Davis, the California Public Utilities 
Commission and Judge Dennis Montali, who is presiding over Pacific Gas & 
Electric's recent bankruptcy filing, an Oakland-based disability watchdog is 
calling for a comprehensive statewide system to ensure that disabled people 
do not fall through the energy crisis safety net.
?????Lawyers from Disability Rights Advocates want a state-mandated emergency 
plan that responds to the "disproportionate and life-threatening impact of 
the energy crisis on people with disabilities."
?????Activists are calling for a statewide early-warning system; the creation 
of charging stations on exempt circuits for recharging equipment during 
blackouts; funds to buy backup batteries and generators and a toll-free 
emergency hotline for the disabled.
?????They also seek a state investigation into remedies for the long-term 
impacts--including rate increases.
?????Gray says the prospect of losing power and relying on unreliable 
generators pervades even her dreams.
?????"I spend my days worrying," she says. "I worry over when the next 
blackout will come. I worry about my friends who are in similar, if not 
worse, predicaments than me--who rely on their respirators. Let me tell you, 
this is no way to live."
?????At least two utilities said Monday they already employ an early-warning 
system for many customers on life support, but were open to other suggestions 
on how to improve services for the disabled. They added that the burden also 
rests with state officials.
?????Activists, who called the letters a first attempt to open discussions of 
the issues, say they have not ruled out a class-action lawsuit on behalf of 
what they say are 3 million people with disabilities in California.
?????"The response should not be an ad hoc process--one utility doing this 
and another that," said Shawna Parks, an attorney for the Oakland nonprofit. 
"We want an organized system that addresses some very serious needs. And as 
for any lawsuit if this doesn't happen, we're not closing any doors."
?????Disability Rights Advocates recently won major concessions in settling a 
lawsuit it filed against health care giant Kaiser Permanente for failing to 
address the needs of its wheelchair patients.
?????PUC Commissioner Carl Wood said Monday he would be open to any 
suggestions to assist the sick, elderly and disabled in the event of 
continued blackouts. "The energy crisis has put a huge burden on the most 
vulnerable people in our society--people just trying to survive," he said.
?????But funding new programs presents problems.
?????"One utility faces bankruptcy and others could be close, so some might 
question the wisdom of giving them new mandates when there may be no money to 
fund them," Wood said. "The goals are reasonable. The question is where the 
money comes from."
?????Dan Quigley, director of emergency communications for PG&E, said the 
company contacts about 22,000 life-support customers before anticipated 
blackouts. Another 48,000 are part of a medical baseline program in which 
they receive reduced electrical rates.
?????"We didn't design the system to shut people off and cause them 
inconvenience," he said. "We're eager to work with the PUC and disabled 
advocates to figure out a system that reduces the disruption."
?????Quigley added, however, that some of the activists' suggestions--such as 
community battery charging stations--would be better served by state 
emergency response groups.
?????Anita Gore, a spokesperson for the state's massive health and human 
services agency, said the suggestions will be considered. "This is all 
relatively new," she said of the blackouts, "so we're gearing up to address 
concerns of the disabled and everyone else."
?????Ed Van Herik, a spokesman for San Diego Gas & Electric, said the company 
notifies 3,500 life-support customers of impending blackouts and "calls those 
customers back later to make sure the power has come back on."
?????He echoed concerns about the suggestion of an emergency hotline. "Some 
of those calls might be better handled by 911," he said.
?????Disability Rights Advocates has recently heard from dozens of disabled 
residents from across the state, including a woman who uses a respirator to 
breathe at night--who says she must stay awake during blackouts because she 
cannot afford a generator.
?????A deaf man who uses visual alarms for the phone, doorbell, smoke 
detector and baby monitor has lost them during blackouts and fears going 
without power at night--saying his family will have difficulty communicating 
because they use sign language.
?????Another disabled woman who uses a wheelchair told advocates she was 
stranded in her apartment during a blackout because the elevator did not work 
and she could not use the stairs.
?????Parks said activists want the utilities to expand services for the 
disabled.
?????"There are situations faced by the disabled that aren't defined as 
critical by the utilities," she said. "There are many more definitions of 
being disabled than to be on a respirator or life support."
?????Lori Gray knows how the system can fail the disabled.
?????She was expelled from PG&E's medical baseline program last summer after 
failing to respond to a company letter requiring her to recertify.
?????"They sent a printed letter, but I'm blind and can't see," she said. 
"But they bounced me anyway."
?????Now Gray must acquire new letters from her doctors to get readmitted 
into the program. And when she asked utility officials to attach a staple to 
the return address of future letters so she could distinguish them as 
important mail, they refused--until she complained to PUC officials.
?????Gray says she would do anything to be included in the early warning 
programs because notification could be a lifesaver.
?????"It would relieve the stress of worrying when the next blackout is 
coming," she said. "I think the disabled deserve that much."

In 1st Hearing, PUC Urged to Lift Rate Hike 
Energy: Speakers call on the agency to rescind the increase approved last 
month. Officials caution that they are focusing on "who pays and how much." 

By NANCY RIVERA BROOKS, Times Staff Writer 

?????The lights were out to save energy in a Santa Monica hearing room, but 
the heat was on as consumers and business representatives urged the 
California Public Utilities Commission on Monday to spread the pain of rate 
increases fairly--but differed substantially on how that could be 
accomplished.
?????Many of the more than 30 speakers who appeared at the PUC's first public 
hearing on how to design new electricity rates spent their time trying to 
persuade the commission to undo the increase of 3 cents a kilowatt-hour, 
which was approved March 27 and is expected to begin appearing on bills in 
June.
?????Although Commissioner Henry Duque and Administrative Law Judge Victor 
Ryerson listened politely and court reporters took down every word, those 
fervent pleas were largely wasted.
?????Ryerson admonished the audience of about 75 people that the hearing 
would not determine whether rate increases are necessary to pay for soaring 
electricity costs. That already has been decided by the PUC, he said.
?????Rather, the series of hearings this week throughout the state, each 
attended by one of the five PUC commissioners, will focus on "who pays and 
how much," Ryerson said.
?????That wasn't what consumer advocate Douglas Heller wanted to hear.
?????"The PUC is asking the wrong questions," said Heller of the Foundation 
for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica. "The question that the PUC 
should be asking is: How do we get our state back?"
?????"Small consumers never asked for deregulation and never benefited from 
it," Heller said. "The innocent victims of this public policy nightmare 
should not bear the burden of the energy industry's greed and the governor's 
failure to confront it."
?????About 20 different rate plans have been submitted to the PUC, which is 
expected to adopt a rate design at its meeting next Monday. PUC officials 
said that rates will rise by an average of 30% but that some customers will 
see no increases while some will see much larger increases.
?????The commission is under tremendous pressure to devise a new rate 
structure that encourages conservation but doesn't damage businesses--and to 
do it in six weeks rather than the usual six months or longer.
?????Some who testified Monday in Santa Monica feared that the new rates will 
cause families to subsidize single users and will penalize those that are 
already conserving electricity.
?????David Marshall, chief financial officer of El Monte-based Gregg 
Industries, asked that the PUC retain lower rates for the hours when 
electricity use is lower.
?????Gregg, which employs 400 people to make heavy iron parts for industry, 
has shifted all its production to between midnight and noon, he said. That is 
the only way Gregg can continue to compete, Marshall said.
?????His company does business in the United States, Mexico, Europe and Asia, 
"and in every one of those markets we have direct competitors anxious to take 
business away from us," Marshall said. "California is not an island."
?????Encino resident Donald Tollefson argued that consumers should be spared 
the brunt of the rate increases because they will be forced to pay twice: for 
their own higher electricity rates and in the form of price increases as 
businesses pass along their higher energy costs.
?????"Whatever you do," he said, "you should be fair and compassionate."
?????About 200 people attended a similar hearing in a dimly lit high school 
auditorium in Rosemead.
?????Bob Wellemin, an air-conditioner mechanic from Temple City, said the 
commission should take the blame for not pushing to build more power plants.
?????"How on Earth have you been representing the consumers?" he said, 
evoking applause. "And what I don't understand is that we have three or four 
meetings like this ahead. And we got a May 14 deadline to make a decision. I 
don't want to sound skeptical. But how can I not be skeptical when you've got 
one representative here and a week to decide."
?????Wellemin also criticized the commission's proposed rate increases, 
saying that it would hurt people who already conserve energy. As a resident 
with low-energy appliances and no central air-conditioning, he said he would 
be penalized because it would be difficult to reduce his power from one month 
to the next.
?????Others warned the commission to take a methodical approach in deciding 
the rate plan.
?????"If I have to act businesslike, I would expect state representatives to 
act the same," said Don Osborn, a small business owner from the San Gabriel 
Valley. "I haven't seen that."

An Oilman's Dream 

?????A hot week is forecast for California. It began Monday with Stage 1, 2 
and 3 power alerts, topped by statewide rolling blackouts. Say hello to 
summer, which California will have to get through with little help from the 
White House. 
?????Both President Bush and Vice President Cheney are Texas oil patch 
veterans, which may explain, if not excuse, their backward-thinking energy 
policy ideas. 
?????Last week, Cheney gave a speech in which he said the nation must develop 
new supplies of oil and natural gas, use more coal and rely more on nuclear 
power. That's a policy for the 1950s or 1960s, when oil was king, but not for 
this century and certainly not for California. 
?????Cheney gave some lip service to conservation but not, heaven forbid, 
anything that would "affect lifestyles." The nation simply cannot "conserve 
or ration our way out" of energy shortages, he said in an obvious dig at 
California energy policies from the Jerry Brown days. 
?????Cheney's dig finally stirred the White House to some lukewarm concern. 
President Bush, after expressing little sympathy or empathy for California 
the past 100 days, came out with a plan to cut power use by 10% in federal 
offices in California during Stage 2 and 3 emergencies. Gee, thanks. 
?????In an interview with The Times at the end of last week, Cheney repeated 
this administration's reliance on fossil fuels. And he slammed California 
again by saying his energy plan sees the state as an example of things not to 
do. He's wrong on that count too. California in fact has done much to praise. 
?????The state has the lowest per capita electric power use in the nation. 
Today, nearly a third of all our power comes from renewable and alternative 
sources. Even so, some of these sources, particularly solar, have barely been 
tapped. 
?????We do need to develop more oil and natural gas from our own federal 
lands. But we are not so desperate that we need to spoil the pristine 
wilderness of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska or California's 
Los Padres National Forest, home of the condor. In fact, modest improvements 
in the fuel efficiency of autos and sport utility vehicles could save far 
more oil, and sooner, than getting it from the refuge. 
?????But nuclear and coal are no answer, even if Cheney's Wyoming is the 
leading coal-producing state. One tactic of this administration is to mock 
California for creating its own shortage by adopting extreme environmental 
protection laws while its citizens soak in hot tubs. But consider that the 
state was a leader in turning to clean-burning and then-plentiful natural gas 
instead of fuel oil. And the utilities stopped building nuclear plants 
because of economics and safety, not because of environmental protectionism. 
?????The nation does need a new energy policy, and the administration is 
expected to announce its official strategy within two weeks. To base it on 
domestic fossil fuel production would be folly. Cheney is right that we can't 
conserve our way out of the energy crisis. Yet we can't begin to drill our 
way out, either. Copyright 2001 Los Angeles Times

Cheney's an Oaf on Conservation 
By ROBERT SCHEER


?????Why beat around the Bush? Surrogate President Dick Cheney is behaving 
like an oil-guzzling, intellectually irresponsible, anti-environmental oaf. 
?????How else to define one who summarily dismisses the promising advances 
made in energy conservation while urging the more rapid depletion of fossil 
fuel resources and construction of nuclear power plants? 
?????Cheney is a mouthpiece for energy companies like Halliburton, his former 
employer, which paid him $36 million in his last year of brief service as its 
CEO in a field he previously knew nothing about. But the company, which 
prospers when new power plants are built, got its money's worth when 
President Bush added "energy policy czar" to Cheney's extensive White House 
portfolio, leaving the president ample time to greet Little League teams. 
?????Ever grateful to the oil bigwigs who made him financially whole while 
lavishly supporting the GOP ticket, Cheney barely took up his new civic 
responsibility before launching a war on energy conservation. In his words, 
the commitment to conservation, endorsed by a long line of presidents of both 
parties, was valuable primarily as therapy for tree-huggers: "Conservation 
may be a sign of personal virtue, but it is not a sufficient basis for a 
sound, comprehensive energy policy." 
?????Nonsense. Conservation works, and according to the latest government 
studies--pointedly ignored by Cheney--it could be a major factor in staving 
off any future energy crisis. 
?????As the New York Times reported in its lead story Sunday, "Scientists at 
the country's national laboratories have projected enormous energy savings if 
the government takes aggressive steps to encourage energy conservation in 
homes, factories, offices, appliances, cars and power plants." ?????The 
three-year studies by the five national science laboratories undermine 
Cheney's shrill insistence that the country must pop for a huge new polluting 
power plant every week for the next two decades, lest our homes and factories 
go dark. The studies concluded that a government-led conservation program 
could cut growth in energy consumption almost in half, using proven 
technology already tested and in place. 
?????Such technology is already saving energy and money at Cheney's official 
residence at the Naval Observatory and at President Bush's new ranch in 
Crawford, Texas. Inexplicably, what's good for them isn't good enough for the 
rest of the country. 
?????To ignore scientific breakthroughs on energy conservation is to lie to 
the American people about the dimensions of the problem. This is not 
leadership; this is fear-mongering that withholds from the American public 
sound scientific information in order to justify eviscerating conservation 
policy. 
?????Indeed, the administration's 2002 budget kills much of President 
Clinton's program to improve energy efficiency in building construction, 
heating and appliances, savings that would have obviated the need for an 
estimated 170 new power plants. 
?????Cheney chose to attack conservation at the very time when California 
embarked on a major plan to end its electricity shortage through lowering 
consumer demand--a shortage that Cheney irresponsibly blames on 
environmentalists who were insisting on pollution controls. 
?????California's crisis is being created by the price-gouging of mostly 
out-of-state energy suppliers that are taking advantage of a deregulation 
plan hatched by former Republican Gov. Pete Wilson in cahoots with the 
privately owned utilities. The utilities wanted to sell off what they 
incorrectly figured to be the less-profitable energy production business, 
including ever-troubled nuclear plants of the sort Cheney now embraces. In 
return, they agreed to temporary caps on consumer prices. 
?????The problem is that the feds control wholesale prices, which they didn't 
cap. Last week, when the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission finally 
recognized that it needed to exercise its legal authority to cap wholesale 
prices, Cheney blasted it: "If I had been at FERC, I never would have voted 
for short-term price caps." 
?????California consumers should remember Cheney's refusal to rein in the 
price-gougers come the next election. 
?????Finally, whatever happened to the monarchs of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait 
saved by former President Bush and then-Defense Secretary Cheney during the 
Gulf War? 
?????The monarchs sit atop the world's largest oil reserve. Wouldn't you 
think that since they owe their continued existence to the Bush clan, they 
might return the favor with lower oil prices? Instead, U.S. consumers are 
being punished at the gas pumps with some of the highest prices in recent 
memory. 
?????The dirty secret is that the Texas oilmen in the White House like the 
price of foreign crude to be very high. That justifies increased U.S. 
production, even in pristine lands, and boosts energy profits, which 
doubtless will fatten the coffers of Republican candidates in the next 
election. 
?????You can't say we weren't warned. Put two Texas oil guys in the White 
House, and they are going to seize any opportunity to grease the palms of 
their big oil backers while raping the environment. 
?????Still, it is surprising that they are being so obscenely blatant about 
it.

Secret power deals contain hidden costs 
THE CLAUSE: A link to natural gas prices 
David Lazarus, Chronicle Staff Writer
Tuesday, May 8, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle 
URL: 
http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2001/05/08/MN38174.DTL 
While Gov. Gray Davis insists that California's top-secret contracts to buy 
electricity will lead to more stable prices in years ahead, the deals 
actually may expose consumers to even higher energy bills, The Chronicle has 
learned. 
At least a portion of the contracts contain what is known in industry jargon 
as a "gas escalator" clause, which allows power companies to increase prices 
as their natural gas costs go up, according to sources familiar with the 
agreements. 
Analysts predict that natural gas prices could climb in years ahead as dozens 
of new gas-fired power plants in the Western region compete for tight 
supplies. 
This makes it possible, analysts said, that the $13 billion in bonds 
California intends to offer to pay for its power purchases will not be enough 
to cover the full cost of the contracts, some of which last as long as 10 
years. 
The state now spends more than $50 million a day to purchase electricity on 
behalf of cash-strapped utilities. Davis has argued that long-term power 
contracts will ease California's financial burden. 
"The governor has suggested that he has all these contracts lined up at a 
certain price," said Jeff Dietert, an energy-industry analyst with Simmons & 
Co. in Houston. "He's been deceptive to a certain extent on that point." 
However, S. David Freeman, Davis' top energy adviser and the negotiator for 
most of the state's power accords, said yesterday that escalator clauses are 
"the rare exception for the bulk of the contracts." 
"The overwhelming majority do not have any escalators in them," he said. "The 
price is firm." 
Freeman acknowledged, though, that a number of contracts "were finished after 
I left, so I don't know about them." 
He stopped negotiating California's power contracts in early March and 
returned to his job as general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water 
and Power. Freeman returned to Sacramento as the state's newly appointed 
energy czar in mid-April. 
California consumers so far have had to take the governor's word that the 
long-term contracts will work to their benefit. Details of the more than 40 
accords have remained shrouded in secrecy as Davis argues that revealing the 
contents would jeopardize future negotiations. 
The Chronicle and other media outlets are suing the governor for access to 
the contracts, which involve about $40 billion in public funds. 
A state judge ruled last week in San Diego that Davis has until May 14 to 
file papers defending his decision to keep the contracts secret. The next 
hearing in the case is scheduled for June 1. 
Roger Myers, a partner with the San Francisco law firm of Steinhart & 
Falconer, which represents The Chronicle and the Associated Press in the 
lawsuit against the governor, said news of the gas escalator clauses could 
have bearing on the case. 
"The fact that this information has not been made previously available 
illustrates the importance of unsealing the contracts so the public can see 
what's in them," he said. 
Little is known about the contracts except that they are at an average price 
of $69 per megawatt hour for about 9,000 megawatts -- almost a fourth of 
California's current electricity needs. 
However, analysts said power companies routinely demand that fuel- adjustment 
clauses be included in long-term contracts as a way to minimize their risk. 
"No one's going to sign a contract that doesn't contain a fuel-cost 
adjustment," said William Hyler, an analyst at CIBC World Markets in New 
York. 
To be sure, there is a chance that California's electricity costs could 
decline under some contracts if the price of natural gas, which fuels most 
modern power plants, comes down from currently sky-high levels in years 
ahead. 
Most industry analysts foresee gas prices decreasing over the next few years 
as suppliers boost production. Longer term, however, prices could once again 
soar as new gas-fired power plants push demand higher. 
Gas prices are now more than 50 percent below their winter peak of $10 per 
million British thermal units but are expected to climb again this summer. 
About 30,000 megawatts of new power plants in the Western region are 
scheduled to come online this year, and dozens of other plants are expected 
to begin operating over the next five years. 
Tight supply makes it difficult, to say the least, to predict where prices 
might be over the duration of California's long-term contracts, which vary in 
length from three to 10 years. 
"You can't accurately predict the price of fuel, especially over that period 
of time," said Duane Grubert, an analyst at brokerage Sanford C. Bernstein in 
New York. 
He and other analysts said volatile fuel prices only increase the likelihood 
of power bills going up for California consumers, despite locking in supplies 
of power through long-term accords.

Bush won't budge on fuel prices 
Despite fears of a $3 gallon, he will oppose controls 
Verne Kopytoff, Benjamin Pimentel, George Raine, Chronicle Staff Writers
Tuesday, May 8, 2001

As oil companies quietly warned service station owners that fuel may rise to 
$3 a gallon this summer, the Bush administration said yesterday that it will 
do nothing to curb soaring gasoline prices. 
The statement from the White House followed a report yesterday that gas 
prices are at record high levels in the Bay Area. 
"If any politician has a magic wand that they can wave over gas prices to 
lower them, the president . . . would like to listen to them," said Ari 
Fleischer, the White House spokesman. 
Bush is opposed to price controls and did not support cutting the 18.4- 
cents-a-gallon federal gas tax during the presidential campaign. 
The California State Automobile Association said a gallon of regular self- 
serve unleaded now averages $2.10 in San Francisco and $2.03 in San Jose. The 
state average is also at a record high of $1.95, the association reported. 
"It's outrageous," said Dave Miller, a contractor from San Rafael, while 
filling up an Oldsmobile sports utility vehicle yesterday at a Shell station 
in San Francisco. "I see three bucks coming." 
Fear that gas will reach $3 a gallon spread last week when service station 
owners were advised by some oil companies to have the number "3" on hand to 
place on their signs should the price climb to $3 a gallon. One of the 
operators was Bob Oyster of Redwood City, who operates 27 Shell and Chevron 
stations in the Bay Area. 
"They said, 'Make sure you are prepared,' " Oyster said. "There has been a 
lot of talk over the weeks by oil people that the price is going up, but 
there's a larger issue, and $3 may be a bargain." 
Oyster blames oil industry consolidation and dwindling competition for the 
higher prices. He said there are half as many oil companies and dealers as 10 
years ago. 
"If the consolidation and lack of competition continues, we're going to be 
talking about $6 per gallon, not $3," Oyster said. 
Taking into account inflation, gas prices are now the highest they have been 
since 1981. That was when President Ronald Reagan ended price controls on the 
oil industry and gas prices spiked to $1.38 a gallon -- $2.30 a gallon when 
adjusted to today's dollars. 
1918 RECORD 
Gas prices need to jump above $2.75 cents a gallon to beat the record 
adjusted for inflation. That record was set in 1918. 
Phil Verleger Jr., an oil industry analyst in Newport Beach, said the chance 
of gas reaching $3 a gallon this summer is probably slightly more than 1 in 
3. He said it depends on several factors, including whether the state's 
electricity crisis causes blackouts at oil refineries. 
"Those idiots at the California Public Utilities Commission seem to not care 
for the fact that refineries do not operate the same way printing plants do," 
Verleger said. "You can't just turn them off and on with a switch." 
California's gas supply is especially vulnerable to price fluctuations 
because of the state's requirement for cleaner burning fuel. There are just 
enough refineries to keep the state supplied, and if one malfunctions, prices 
soar. 
Olivia Malabuyo, a director of a nonprofit in San Francisco and part-time 
actress, said high gas prices are painful. She earns a modest salary and 
drives nearly 400 miles a week, much of it by commuting from Oakland. 
"It's going to make my pay check a lot smaller," Malabuyo said while filing 
up her Toyota Corolla with medium-grade gas for $2.26 a gallon. "It's hard to 
refuse to pay if you have to get to work." 
ENERGY POLICY FORTHCOMING
The White House is expected to release an energy policy this month that 
includes long-term solutions to supply shortages as opposed to short-term 
strategies such as price controls. One controversial solution already 
proposed is to drill for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. 
Fleischer said Bush "has never sought a quick fix because quick fixes don't 
work. He will resist the siren song of moving from one short-term solution to 
another." 
Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California has asked Bush in letters and telephone 
calls to temporarily waive a requirement for oxygenates in the state's gas. 
The oxygenates reduce pollution but also lead to higher fuel costs. 
"Unfortunately, the administration has refused to act on this requirement," 
said Howard Gantman, a spokesman for Feinstein. 
SIGNS OF SETTLING DOWN
However, there are signs that gas prices are stabilizing for now, according 
to Bronwyn Hogan, a spokeswoman for the California State Automobile 
Association. She said prices are no longer increasing by a penny each day, 
and may in fact be declining slightly in some locations. 
According to the Energy Information Administration, the national mean gas 
price in May is expected to be $1.60 a gallon, about 5 percent above the 
record set last year. That could very well be the highest it gets for now, 
the agency said. 
Past price spikes have prompted concern that oil companies are engaging in 
monopolistic behavior. However, the Federal Trade Commission concluded 
yesterday that there is no evidence major oil refiners violated antitrust 
laws in marketing West Coast gasoline during past price spikes. 
The investigation, which began three years ago, "found no evidence of 
collusion between oil companies" nor any agreement on pricing "at any level 
of supply." 
But even some workers at gas stations believe the prices they currently 
charge are outrageous. Jeff Triplitt, a manager at a Shell station in San 
Francisco, said he does not get a discount for gas where he works and in fact 
fills up his Chevrolet suburban at another station where it is cheaper. 
"It's just ridiculous," Triplitt said. "If they bring down the price by 10 
cents, that will make a big difference."

Hot weather sparks new round of blackouts 
SUPPLIES LOW: Usage keeps climbing as temperatures surpass 90 degrees 
John Wildermuth, Michael Pena, Chronicle Staff Writers
Tuesday, May 8, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle 
URL: 
http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2001/05/08/MN5423.DTL 

California's long, dark summer began yesterday as the energy crunch forced 
power officials to black out more than 200,000 homes and businesses around 
the state. 
Soaring temperatures -- and a supply situation so precarious that even a 
highway project that shut down a gas line in Ventura County was cause for 
concern -- forced the state to turn out the lights. 
The decision to call for the first blackouts since March 20 came at 4:45 p. 
m. and capped a day when the state's utilities thought they had dodged the 
blackout bullet. 
"The temperatures ended up well above what was forecast and really took off 
at the end of the day," said Stephanie McCorkle, a spokeswoman for the 
California Independent System Operator. "And demand went right up with it." 
The ISO ordered the state's three private utilities to cut a total of 300 
megawatts. In Northern and Central California, 54,000 customers of Pacific 
Gas and Electric Co. lost power for about an hour. 
SCATTERED POWER LOSSES
The blackouts were scattered throughout the Bay Area. Among the areas blacked 
out were South San Francisco's industrial area east of Highway 101 as well as 
homes across town near Interstate 280. In Mountain View, an undetermined 
number of homes and businesses across Highway 101 from Moffett Field lost 
power, while parts of San Leandro also went dark. 
Police reported no blackout-related problems. 
"This wasn't too big an outage," said Ron Low, a PG&E spokesman. "March 20, 
the last time we had blackouts, there were 438,000 of our customers 
affected." 
Power officials called the Stage 3 alert and blackouts when electricity 
reserves dropped below 1.5 percent. 
While power officials originally predicted no power blackouts for the rest of 
the week, they were backing away from that forecast by yesterday evening. 
A Stage 2 alert is likely today, meaning power reserves are expected to drop 
below 5 percent, and a new round of blackouts is a real possibility. 
"We're stressing that it's a very dynamic situation," McCorkle said. "A lot 
depends on the temperature, and we've heard it's going to be even hotter 
(today). We're really preaching conservation." 
SHADES OF SUMMER
Yesterday probably was just a sample of what the summer will be like. The 
power demands that hot weather brings -- and the resulting energy shortfall 
-- are likely to continue for the next four months. 
"It's the first day of what will be many this summer," said Jim McIntosh, 
director of operations for the ISO. 
The unexpected loss of some electricity from Canada, along with the planned 
shutdowns of some nuclear plants, nearly brought blackouts earlier in the 
day. But planned emergency measures to limit power usage, along with some 
conservation efforts, kept the lights on -- at least for a few more hours. 
"At 11 a.m., we were within five minutes of going to blackouts," McIntosh 
said. 
The bulk of the conservation came from customers with interruptible service 
agreements, who have agreed to accept short-term power cuts in exchange for 
lower rates. But about 150 megawatts came from customers who decided on their 
own to chop back their energy usage. Each megawatt is enough to supply power 
to 1,000 homes. 
"The 150 megawatts doesn't sound like much, but it made a difference today, " 
McIntosh said. "And during the summer, it would make a difference every day." 
RISING TEMPERATURES
It was a record 93 degrees in San Francisco yesterday, and temperatures also 
reached new heights in Oakland, Santa Rosa and Hollister. As the mercury 
soared in the Bay Area and Central Valley, people were thinking about the 
energy crunch. 
Lenshina Pendar, a pre-med student at the University of California at San 
Francisco, said her family in Hercules had started using the air conditioner 
again -- sparingly. 
"Definitely, we turn it on, but not so high," Pendar said. "We leave it on 
maybe for 30 minutes." 
At the Pleasant Hill BART station, people said they were taking advantage of 
the heat. 
"I hung my clothes on the line today," said Lisa Kelley of Walnut Creek. 
She also has a backyard swimming pool. "It's almost swimmable," Kelley said. 
"It's 73 degrees without heating or anything." 
PRECARIOUS SITUATION
Yesterday's events showed the delicate balance of the state's energy 
situation. 
California's generation capacity already has been cut because the nuclear 
power plants that supply power to the state are either shut down or working 
at limited capacity. While the San Onofre plant near San Clemente has been 
offline since a fire in February, the Diablo Canyon plant near San Luis 
Obispo and plants in Arizona and Washington are down because of long-planned 
maintenance and refueling. 
Meanwhile, a not-so-wet winter has cut the amount of hydroelectric power 
produced by dams throughout the West, leaving California's power grid 
vulnerable to almost any disruption. 
Yesterday, for example, an expected 1,000 megawatts didn't materialize when a 
Canadian supplier stayed off the energy market for three hours in the 
morning, forcing the ISO to scramble for replacement power. 
Even some roadwork in Ventura County that shut down the gas line to a local 
power plant was cited as a potential threat to the state's energy supply. 
California's power grid is working on such a tight margin that the unexpected 
loss of a power plant can quickly plunge part of the state into darkness, 
McIntosh warned. 
"It doesn't have to be a huge plant," he said. "Certainly today it didn't 
have to be." 
PG&E customers who are vulnerable to rolling blackouts are grouped into 14 
blocks; when blackouts hit, customers in those blocks lose power for one to 
two hours. Yesterday's blackouts started in Block 14; the next group hit will 
be the remaining customers in Block 14 and then those in Block 1. 
Each block contains about 225,000 customers. PG&E customers can determine 
their block by looking at the bottom left-hand corner of their monthly bill. 
-- The blackout: About 225,000 customers statewide, including 54,000 PG&E 
customers in Block 14, lost power from 4:45 to 5:41 p.m. 
-- Why it happened: High temperatures brought on unusually high demand for 
electricity, and supplies were tight because several plants were shut down 
for maintenance. 
-- Today's outlook: Power grid managers expect to have sufficient power to 
meet demand but warn another blackout is possible. 
-- Power Block Outages: The last rolling power outages occurred in the 
following blocks: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 
Next outage block: 14 then 1

TUESDAY:
-- The state remains free of power alerts in the early morning, although grid 
operators warn that high temperatures could force blackouts again. 
-- A coalition of churches announce an initiative to encourage power 
conservation among member religions. 
-- The state Senate could decide to vote on a $13.4 billion bond to pay for 
the state's power buys. 
-- Gov. Gray Davis meets with representatives of energy wholesalers. 
-- The Public Utilities Commission continues its round of hearings on the 
rate increases affecting customers of the three investor-owned utilities. 
They meet at 2 p.m. in Fresno and 7 p.m. in Visalia. 
-- Pacific Gas and Electric Co. is expected to file more papers with the 
bankruptcy court. 
MONDAY:
--Power grid operators order rolling blackouts due to warmer than average 
temperatures and scarce supplies of power. The California Independent System 
Operator was able to stave off an earlier threat of blackouts by asking large 
commercial users to cut back on their electricity use. ISO officials say 
several key power plants that normally provide enough power for about 9.4 
million homes are off-line today for pre-summer maintenance. 
--Davis is recruiting janitors in his energy saving campaign. Davis says 
janitors are part of a plan calling for cooperation from landlords, employers 
and workers to conserve power to protect the state from blackouts this 
summer. 
--The governor says he's ``very, very close'' to a deal with San Diego Gas & 
Electric to purchase the utility's transmission lines. Davis says he hopes to 
have it completed by the end of the week. ``These negotiations do not move in 
a straight line,'' he says. ``You make progress, then you get detoured, you 
get back on track, then you get detoured, but I believe we are very, very 
close to resolving that issue.'' 
--About 200 people show up at a Public Utilities Commission hearing in Santa 
Monica to ask state regulators for a break from the largest electricity rate 
increase in state history. The PUC in March approved rate increase of up to 
40 percent for customers of PG&E and Southern California Edison. The 
commission has scheduled 11 public hearings on the issue around the state, 
and could implement the hikes as early as next month. 
--Democratic lawmakers will have a tough time winning their lawsuit alleging 
that federal energy regulators aren't controlling soaring electricity prices, 
legal experts say. Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg and Senate President Pro 
Tem John Burton say they'll sue the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in 
federal court next week alleging the commission is violating federal law by 
not requiring that electricity costs be ``just and reasonable.'' 
--The state Senate passed a bill to create a windfall profits tax on 
electricity prices that $80 per megawatt hour. The bill passes 25-12. The 
Assembly Revenue and Tax Committee sends the Appropriations Committee a 
similar bill that would tax prices above $60 per megawatt hour. 
--The state Assembly approves a bill to authorize $13.4 billion in bonds for 
power buys. Republican members balked at financing that much money, 
suggesting the state instead spend some of its surplus buying electricity for 
customers of three cash-strapped utilities. 
--State power buyers say they'll draw another $500 million from the general 
fund to buy power to customers of three utilities. That brings the state's 
power-buying tab to $6.7 billion since mid-January. 
--The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approves a pipeline expansion that 
is expected to provide an additional 230 million cubic feet of natural gas to 
Southwest markets, including California. The El Paso Natural Gas Co. plans to 
convert 785 miles of an existing pipeline that now carries crude oil so that 
it will carry natural gas to the high-demand California market. 
--The state initiated a new Web site, www.flexyourpower.ca.gov/rebates, to 
help consumers, businesses, farmers, cities and counties make use of rebates 
and other conservation programs. The site allows consumers to search for 
energy efficiency programs offered by any public agency and their local 
utility district. The same information is available toll-free by calling 
1-800-555-7794 during business hours. 
WHAT'S NEXT:
-- The governor meets Wednesday with the CEOs of several major energy 
suppliers to discuss the money they're owed by the state's two largest 
utilities, the state's creditworthiness and how wholesalers can help the 
state during the energy crisis. Davis says he won't be discussing any of the 
investigations into price manipulation in the wholesale market. 
-- Davis' representatives continue negotiating with Sempra, the parent 
company of San Diego Gas and Electric Co., to buy the utility's transmission 
lines. 
THE PROBLEM:
High demand, high wholesale energy costs, transmission glitches and a tight 
supply worsened by scarce hydroelectric power in the Northwest and 
maintenance at aging California power plants are all factors in California's 
electricity crisis. 
Edison and PG&E say they've lost nearly $14 billion since June to high 
wholesale prices the state's electricity deregulation law bars them from 
passing on to consumers. PG&E, saying it hasn't received the help it needs 
from regulators or state lawmakers, filed for federal bankruptcy protection 
April 6. 
Electricity and natural gas suppliers, scared off by the two companies' poor 
credit ratings, are refusing to sell to them, leading the state in January to 
start buying power for the utilities' nearly 9 million residential and 
business customers. The state is also buying power for a third investor-owned 
utility, San Diego Gas & Electric, which is in better financial shape than 
much larger Edison and PG&E but also struggling with high wholesale power 
costs. 
The Public Utilities Commission has raised rates as much as 46 percent to 
help finance the state's multibillion-dollar power buys.

Blackouts hit California as spring heat wave sets in

(05-08) 07:01 PDT SACRAMENTO (AP) -- Blackouts rolled through California as 
temperatures soared to record levels in a preview of what power grid 
operators warn is in store when summer heat triggers increased demand for air 
conditioning. 
Outages hit portions of selected cities Monday afternoon as California 
slipped off the tightrope of electrical supply and demand for the fifth time 
this year. 
Grid managers said more blackouts were possible Tuesday, although the state 
was under no power alerts in the early morning. 
Rush-hour traffic jammed in communities where signal lights went dark, and 
police officers were dispatched to control intersections. No major incidents 
were reported by the time the blackouts ended, however. 
The early onset of high heat came as imported power was scarce and several 
key plants, including nuclear generating stations, were down for pre-summer 
maintenance. 
The Independent System Operator managed to stave off a late-morning threat of 
blackouts Monday by asking for cutbacks by ``interruptible'' customers who 
get cheaper electricity rates in exchange for scaling back power use during 
emergencies. 
``We were able to take off the interruptible, but only for so long,'' ISO 
spokeswoman Lorie O'Donley said. ``Then they started coming back on and the 
temperatures were still high.'' 
The mercury climbed to a record 93 degrees in San Francisco, while in the 
south temperatures ranged from 80 in downtown Los Angeles to the 90s in the 
valleys and over 100 in the deserts. 
``We expected demand to peak between 3 and 4 p.m. and it didn't,'' O'Donley 
said. ``It just continued to climb.'' 
Grid managers ordered utilities to cut 300 megawatts between 5 p.m. and 6 
p.m. 
Pacific Gas and Electric Co. cut off about 54,000 customers in Northern and 
Central California. 
About 36,000 commercial, industrial and residential customers of Southern 
California Edison were affected in portions of 40 communities. 
San Diego Gas & Electric cut power to about 8,600 customers in Orange County, 
El Cajon and the Torrey Pines and Mira Mesa areas of San Diego. 
The Sacramento Municipal Utility District cut 18 megawatts, affecting about 
4,600 customers in southern Sacramento County. 
Tight electricity supplies and high demand led to two days of rolling 
blackouts Jan. 17 and 18 in Northern California. The ISO ordered statewide 
blackouts March 19 and 20 due to scarce power supplies. 







Scorching heat sparks rolling blackouts 
Posted at 10:45 p.m. PDT Monday, May 7, 2001 
BY STEVE JOHNSON 

Mercury News 


Record temperatures coupled with a spate of out-of-commission power plants 
were all it took to nudge California's electrical system into overload 
Monday, triggering rolling blackouts in a grim prelude to what could become a 
daily reality in coming months. 
With more hot weather forecast, conditions are expected to remain perilous 
today and perhaps Wednesday. But a cooling trend due Thursday should ease the 
threat of more outages, said Jim McIntosh, director of operations for the 
California Independent System Operator, which manages the flow of electricity 
for most of the state. 
State officials have warned that blackouts could become routine this summer, 
particularly if Californians don't get into the habit of using less power. 
``To the extent that you can live without it,'' he said, ``it will make a big 
difference.'' 
Officials ordered power to be shut off at 4:45 p.m. and restored service at 
5:41 p.m., the fifth time state officials have ordered rolling blackouts this 
year. The last was March 20. 
Movie screens, popcorn-makers and video games went quiet for about 20 minutes 
at the Century Capitol multiplex in South San Jose. ``I was just getting into 
it when a screen went blank,'' complained Luis Ortiz. ``Blam. No warning or 
nothing. People just walked out of the theaters wondering what was going 
on.'' 
The most immediate cause of the blackouts was the heat. 
In San Francisco, the 93-degree high recorded Monday exceeded the previous 
record of 91 degrees set on that date in 1987. Downtown Oakland's high of 89 
degrees beat out the 1987 record by one degree. The 91-degree high recorded 
in Salinas outdid the previous high of 89 there in 1967. And in South 
Monterey, 89 degrees exceeded the old record of 84, set back in 1959. 
The hot weather prompted many people to switch on their air conditioners, 
putting a heavy drain on the already severely crimped supply of power. Hot 
weather across the West also limited the amount of power the state normally 
imports from the Southwest by at least 500 megawatts -- or enough for about 
375,000 homes, according to the ISO's McIntosh. 
Nuclear plants off line 
But an even bigger problem was the loss of four nuclear power plants. Two of 
them were in California: Diablo Canyon near San Luis Obispo, which is being 
refueled, and San Onofre in Southern California, which is undergoing repairs 
after a recent fire. 
In addition, the Palo Verde Nuclear Generation Station near Phoenix and the 
Columbia Generating Station in southeast Washington state were undergoing 
routine repairs. 
All four plants are expected to be off line for several more weeks. 
Some California plants that run on natural gas had to shut down because of 
repair work on a natural gas pipeline near Ventura. 
Pacific Gas & Electric Co. spokeswoman Jennifer Ramp said the utility was 
ordered to cut 120 megawatts in its service area, which meant the blackout 
affected about 54,000 homes and businesses from Bakersfield to the Oregon 
border. PG&E has 4.6 million electricity customers. 
In the Bay Area, PG&E customers from San Francisco to San Jose lost power, 
but PG&E and police departments reported no major problems as a result of the 
blackouts. 
``It was very quick. We got the order to restore and everything was back 
up,'' Ramp said. 
At Sumitomo Tire in South San Francisco, Robert Tan was working in his 
sixth-floor office when the air conditioning slowly hummed to a halt. The 
company faced a previous round of rolling blackouts just a month ago, so Tan 
knew exactly how to cope. 
``No one's here, so we just unbuttoned our shirts,'' said Tan, who handles 
shipment orders. ``It's an inconvenience, but we all have to play a role'' in 
conserving energy, he said. 
San Francisco suffered ``little bitty interruptions all over the city,'' but 
reported no problems, said Jim Aldrich, the city's emergency services 
coordinator. 
The rolling blackouts hit parts of Fremont's Irvington district, but city 
officials said emergency crews were able to handle their traffic-snarling 
effect. Police monitored major intersections and planted temporary stop signs 
at others. 
``The blackouts are mainly a traffic issue and an inconvenience to 
businesses,'' said Vic Valdes, division chief with the Fremont Fire 
Department. ``We have an emergency contingency plan under which we've 
prioritized the major traffic intersections that we feel must be staffed 
during a blackout.'' 
Linda Clerkson, a spokeswoman for Palo Alto's city-owned utility, said it 
avoided blackouts by calling on major power users, including Hewlett-Packard, 
Agilent and Roche, to conserve. The regional water treatment plant kicked on 
a generator to help the city's power grid. 
``This was totally not the big test,'' Clerkson said. 
About 34,000 homes and businesses were blacked out in the territory served by 
Southern California Edison, which has 4.2 million electricity customers, and 
the prospect for trouble today ``looks a lot like'' Monday, said spokeswoman 
Karen Shepard-Grimes. 
Conservation helped 
Although the ISO's original warning on Monday morning led utilities to 
believe they might have to cut power to more than one outage block, Ramp said 
that ultimately only about a third of Block 14 was affected. PG&E has 14 
blocks that are subject to rolling blackouts. The remainder of block 14 will 
be included in the next rolling blackouts, followed by customers in block 1. 
Altogether, about 12,500 megawatts of power that is normally available to the 
state was offline Monday. McIntosh of the ISO said state officials hope to 
reduce that figure to about 2,500 megawatts by summer. But if they can't do 
that, he said, the state's ability to avoid future blackouts will largely 
hinge on how much people can conserve. 
Businesses and other large customers helped Monday by agreeing to go on 
backup generators in exchange for lower utility rates. That saved about 850 
megawatts, McIntosh said. He estimated that an additional 150 megawatts was 
saved by other customers who heard about the electricity emergency and 
voluntarily cut back on their electricity use. 
Even so, Californians have done much better than that in the recent past, 
accounting for savings of up to 2,000 megawatts, according to state 
estimates. So while McIntosh thanked consumers Monday, he warned that they'll 
have to do even better this summer. 
``As we roll into the summer and the supply situation remains as it is, 
that's the only way,'' he said.

More than 100,000 customers hit by power blackouts 
Posted at 9:47 p.m. PDT Monday, May 7, 2001 
BY JENNIFER COLEMAN 

Associated Press Writer 



SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Record temperatures in California led the state's 
power grid managers to order rolling blackouts Monday for the first time 
since March, cutting service to slightly more than 100,000 customers. 
The California Independent System Operator said high temperatures in 
California and the West and tight electricity supplies resulted in the 
blackouts between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m. 
``We expected demand to peak between 3 and 4 p.m. and it didn't,'' said ISO 
spokeswoman Lorie O'Donley. ``It just continued to climb.'' 
Grid managers asked utilities to cut 300 megawatts. One megawatt is enough to 
power about 750 homes. 
The blackouts quickly snarled rush-hour traffic in portions of the state. In 
Santa Monica, police dispatched officers to check on the parts of the city 
without power. 
``It has a significant impact on us. We have to have police units out to 
control intersections,'' Lt. Ray Cooper said. 
In San Dimas, traffic jammed intersections without lights, but there was no 
immediate word of accidents, said Nicole Panzone, a law enforcement 
technician with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. 
Pacific Gas and Electric Co. spokesman Ron Low said the utility cut 125 
megawatts in Northern and Central California, affecting about 54,000 
customers. 
San Diego Gas & Electric cut power to about 8,600 customers in Orange County, 
El Cajon and the Torrey Pines and Mira Mesa areas of San Diego. 
The Sacramento Municipal Utility District cut 18 megawatts, affecting about 
4,600 customers in southern Sacramento County, while the outages affected 
approximately 36,000 commercial, industrial and residential customers of 
Southern California Edison. 
Small portions of 40 communities serviced by Edison were hit by the 
blackouts, including Chino Hills, Calimesa, Tulare, Long Beach, Beverly 
Hills, Oxnard, Barstow, Fullerton, Blythe, Santa Monica and Montclair, the 
company said. 
Before the blackouts, the ISO had urged conservation because warm weather 
across the West was pushing up demand for electricity. 
San Francisco reached 93 degrees, 2 degrees higher than the previous record 
set in 1987. Temperatures warmed to summerlike highs in Southern California, 
too, with readings ranging from 80 in downtown Los Angeles to over 100 in the 
deserts. 
In addition, several key power plants were closed for pre-summer maintenance, 
officials said. Those plants normally would provide enough power for about 
9.4 million homes. 
Among the plants down for repairs are four nuclear power plants. 
The ISO declared a Stage 2 alert Monday morning as electricity reserves 
dwindled to close to 5 percent. A Stage 3 alert, when reserves near 1.5 
percent, can prompt blackouts. 
California was hit with rolling blackouts Jan. 17 and 18 and March 19 and 20.









CARMAKER SAYS OUTAGES COULD DAMAGE EQUIPMENT, HARM EFFICIENCY 
Published Tuesday, May 8, 2001, in the San Jose Mercury News 
BY MATT NAUMAN 

Mercury News 


To avoid having to shut down completely during rolling blackouts this summer, 
Fremont's NUMMI auto plant has agreed to cut power usage by 15 percent when 
blackouts loom. 
Plant officials say shutting down operations during a blackout could cause 
damage to equipment, as well as idle 4,800 workers. 
Until recently, NUMMI was immune from California's rolling blackouts because 
it is what's known as a transmission-level customer. 
``We take out electricity raw and transform it on site,'' said Jean-Yves 
Jault, spokesman for New United Motor Manufacturing Inc. 
But, under new rules enacted by the state's Public Utilities Commission, the 
status of NUMMI and other large industrial users with their own substations 
has changed. 
``We took away that blanket exemption,'' said PUC Commissioner Carl Wood, who 
noted that now only ``essential-use customers'' like fire stations are exempt 
from blackouts. 
Instead, the carmaker now falls under the PUC's OBMC, or Optional Binding 
Mandatory Curtailment program, which will require it to curtail power usage 
when rolling blackouts are under way near the plant's Interstate 880 
location. 
To cut its power usage by up to 15 percent, Jault said, the plant will shut 
down some equipment that is not essential to production and switch to on-site 
power generators. The plant will be told by Pacific Gas & Electric Co. when 
blackouts are likely, which will trigger the power cutbacks. 
The Toyota-General Motors joint venture began an energy conservation program 
last year that included installing more efficient motors in some equipment, 
reducing lighting where it was safe to do so and turning off ventilation in 
storage areas. The result has been a 5 to 10 percent reduction in power 
usage. And, since NUMMI will get a credit for those moves, it will only need 
to cut back another 10 percent when blackouts loom, Jault said. 
Efficiency concerns 
NUMMI has submitted its plans to PG&E, Jault said. Wood of the PUC said 
technical details of the power curtailment will be worked out between 
utilities and their customers. 
Blackouts could wreak havoc at NUMMI. Cars and trucks could be lost, and 
equipment could be damaged or destroyed, Jault said. The plant relies on 
just-in-time delivery of many of its parts so a breakdown in efficiency has 
large-scale ramifications. 
Stiff penalties 
``The program is not an easy thing to achieve,'' Jault said of the plan to 
reduce power usage. And penalties for failure to meet the curtailment goals 
are stiff, he said. The first failure comes with a monetary fine, and the 
second one gets a company kicked out of the program. 
Last year, NUMMI's 4,800 workers produced 344,000 Toyota Corolla and 
Chevrolet Prizm sedans and Toyota Tacoma pickups. It is the only auto plant 
on the West Coast, and the only source for Toyota's small pickups. 
``I think they're fairly confident they can reduce power and maintain 
production levels,'' said Barbara McDaniel, spokeswoman for Kentucky-based 
Toyota Motor Manufacturing North America, the parent company of Toyota's 
10-plant manufacturing operation in the United States and Canada that 
produces more than 1 million vehicles annually.

S.F. Airport plans to run extra generators 
Published Tuesday, May 8, 2001, in the San Jose Mercury News 
BY AARON DAVIS 

Mercury News 


Worried about rolling blackouts this summer, San Francisco International 
Airport agreed to spend $5 million for backup generators it has now 
discovered it doesn't need because its radar systems and other airport 
facilities are exempt from blackouts. 
At first officials planned to let the generators sit idle, saying it would be 
too costly to fire them up to help ease the state's power shortage. 
But Monday, as California experienced its first rolling blackout in more than 
a month, officials changed direction and promised to turn the generators on 
whenever statewide power supplies are dangerously low. 
The 10 portable, 1-megawatt generators produce enough electricity for about 
10,000 homes. The airport has leased them for a year and expects delivery 
soon. 
Ron Wilson, an airport spokesman, said the generators were never intended to 
be more than an ``insurance policy'' to keep baggage conveyors and ticket 
machines humming this summer. Officials remain concerned that a blackout 
could hit, despite the airport's exemption. 
``No one has written a letter to San Francisco Airport to guarantee that we 
won't see blackouts,'' Wilson said. ``We're getting different stories from 
different people.'' 
The state Public Utilities Commission exempts communication, navigation and 
traffic control at airports from blackouts because it considers such services 
essential. 
The airport uses about 46 megawatts of power. When it tried conservation 
measures like cutting down on air conditioning in terminals, customers 
complained and some computer equipment was damaged, officials said. 
Worries about summer blackouts started last month when airport officials 
learned the PUC was trying to slim down the list of who is exempt from 
rolling blackouts by setting clearer guidelines for who constitutes an 
``essential'' customer. 
Airport officials ``heard from somebody who heard from somebody else'' they 
might get cut from the list. But despite bad information on the 
heard-it-through-the-grapevine conduit, the new PUC guidelines actually made 
San Francisco International -- and Oakland and San Jose airports -- ``more 
exempt'' than ever before, power officials said. 
``Under the law, the airport used to be exempt simply because it is a large 
transmission customer,'' said Jennifer Ramp, a PG&E spokeswoman. ``But now, 
the entire airport is an exempt customer because it is clearly essential for 
safety reasons.'' 
For many, it came as no surprise that turning off the lights at the nation's 
fifth-busiest airport was a safety risk, Ramp said, ``but we had to 
reevaluate each customer's exempt status.'' By the time they did, the airport 
had leased the generators. 
During a blackout, existing emergency generators protect air traffic control 
towers and runway lights at all three major Bay Area airports. 
It would be the loss of baggage conveyer belts, which move nearly a 
half-million pieces of luggage each day, electronic ticket counters and other 
airport equipment that would grind air travel to a halt if San Francisco 
Airport gets caught up in rolling blackouts, Wilson said. 
The airport will use jet fuel to power the generators during Stage 3 power 
alerts so that it won't have to conserve its power use, Wilson said. 
Talks are stalled on plans for a separate 51-megawatt power plant on airport 
property.

Blackouts back, businesses cope 
In what is likely a preview of things to come, 100,000 in state lose power.

Orange County shopkeepers shuttered doors and hotel managers passed out 
flashlights Monday as soaring temperatures and idle power plants led to 
blackouts across the state, previewing the outages expected to cripple 
California this summer. 
A total of 9,550 customers in Dana Point, Fullerton, Irvine, La Habra, Laguna 
Hills, Laguna Niguel, Mission Viejo, Newport Beach, Tustin and San Juan 
Capistrano, part of 100,000 statewide, lost electricity for about an hour 
beginning at 4:45 p.m. More blackouts could hit today because of warm 
weather, said Jim McIntosh of the California Independent System Operator. 
Nearly half of the state's power capacity was unavailable because plants were 
either closed for planned outages or emergency repairs. 
At the Irvine Marriott, guests meeting in ballrooms continued working after 
employees provided flashlights and light sticks, General Manager Ned Snavely 
said. 
Shopkeepers at Tustin Market Place found different ways of dealing with the 
blackout. While the House of Lamps shut its doors, Jackie Lombardi, a sales 
associate at Kingsbury Road, stuck it out. 
"Cash and calculators work," Lombardi said. 
Paul LaPlante, a senior vice president at Ingram Micro in Santa Ana, worried 
that rolling blackouts would cripple California this summer. 
"We have a long, hot summer ahead of us," he said.












Shortage somewhat a surprise 
State regulators thought they could avert Monday's blackouts, but then demand 
'continued to climb.' 
May 8, 2001

JEFF COLLINS and
TIFFANY MONTGOMERY 
The Orange County Register 
At 11 a.m., California was five minutes away from running out of juice. 
Then, businesses cut power and purchases from Canada boosted supplies, 
averting a rolling blackout. 
But five hours later, after state regulators thought the worst was behind 
them, the grid began to heat up again. 
By 4:45 p.m., about 100,000 Californians from Sacramento to San Diego were 
hit by the first blackouts since March, caused by summerlike temperatures and 
generating plants going off-line. 
"We expected demand to peak between 3 and 4 p.m., and it didn't," said Lorie 
O'Donly, spokeswoman for the Independent System Operator, which manages the 
state's electrical grid. "It just continued to climb." 
The Sacramento Municipal Utility District cut power to about 4,600 customers, 
while San Diego Gas & Electric severed electricity to 8,600 customers, 
including 4,950 in Dana Point, San Juan Capistrano, Laguna Niguel, Laguna 
Hills and Mission Viejo. Southern California Edison cut power to 4,600 
customers in Fullerton, Irvine, La Habra, Tustin and Newport Beach. 
Scott Lowe, a guard at the west end of Big Canyon, a gated community north of 
Newport Beach's Fashion Island, watched as a driver crashed through a traffic 
gate, apparently thinking it would open automatically. 
Lowe then opened all the gates with a wrench. 
At Il Fornaio Cuccina in Irvine, employees tallied bills using calculators 
and hand- delivered orders. 
"If it was like an hour and a half later (during the peak dining period), it 
would have been a disaster," said manager Ottavio Oro. 
Police delivered barricades and stop signs to about five or six key 
intersections around Tustin Market Place, where an outage occurred, Lt. Mike 
Shanahan said. Market Place security directed traffic within the shopping 
area. 
Motorists reverted to treating all darkened intersections like four-way 
stops. 
"I think people had just become accustomed to (blackouts) and are getting 
better at it," Shanahan said. 
The afternoon power crunch hit primarily because the grid operator had 
already called on large businesses to cut power early in the day. Because 
those businesses have to curtail power for only six hours, many began turning 
on air conditioning and lighting systems from 4 to 5 p.m. 
Higher temperatures statewide also drove up demand. 
San Francisco reached a record 93 degrees. Chatsworth, in the San Fernando 
Valley, hit a record-tying 96. 
The possibility of rolling blackouts will persist this week until 
temperatures cool Thursday or Friday, said Jim McIntosh, the ISO's operations 
director. 
"We're going to need more conservation efforts,'' he said. 
Nearly half of the state's power capacity remained off- line Monday - 
including four nuclear power plants in the West. Roughly 15,500 megawatts of 
electricity - enough to light up to 15.5 million homes - were unavailable 
because plants were either closed for emergency repairs, planned outages or 
because of nonpayments from the state's largest utilities. 
Register staff writers Laura Corbin, Eric Johnson, Morgan Sales, Ann Pepper

Gas pipeline expansion OKd to benefit Southwest. 
May 8, 2001 
By The Associated Press 
WASHINGTON - The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Monday approved a 
pipeline expansion that is expected to provide an additional 230 million 
cubic feet of natural gas to Southwest markets, including California. 
The El Paso Natural Gas Co. plans to convert 785 miles of an existing 
pipeline that now carries crude oil so that it will carry natural gas to the 
high-demand California market. 
FERC Chairman Curt Hebert said the swift action on the case by the agency, 
which acted after only two months, "demonstrates our commitment to get needed 
energy supplies to serve the ever-increasing demand in the West." 
The $154 million project involves a pipeline that runs from McCamey, Texas, 
to Ehrenberg, Ariz., near the California state line. El Paso is buying the 
line from All American Pipeline and converting it from crude oil to natural 
gas. 
The line would serve as a loop to El Paso's existing system that serves the 
Southwest market, including California, the FERC said. 
The expansion, which the company has indicated would be completed by August, 
would add 230 million cubic feet of natural gas capacity to the El Paso 
mainline, according to FERC and the company. 
Natural gas shortages have been cited by industry as a reason for unusually 
high natural gas prices in California. Last week, spot prices of gas at 
California's trading hub ranged from about $12 to more than $14 per thousand 
cubic feet, compared with just under $5 per cubic foot elsewhere. 
Tough road ahead seen for lawsuit over energy pricing 
SACRAMENTO - Legislative leaders will have a tough time winning their lawsuit 
alleging that federal energy regulators aren't controlling soaring 
electricity prices, legal experts said Monday. 
Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg and Senate President Pro Tem John Burton 
plan to sue in federal court early next week alleging the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission is violating federal law by not requiring that 
electricity costs be "just and reasonable." 
Current prices are "unconscionable," said Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys, while 
announcing the suit Monday. "It's just absolutely destabilizing California." 
The suit will ask that prices be capped and overcharges be reimbursed, said 
Burton, D-San Francisco. FERC officials could not be reached for comment 
Saturday or Monday. 
Their attorney, Joseph Cotchett, acknowledged it "is a very difficult case" 
and said he plans to include other electricity consumers and possibly 
California cities to overcome objections that the Legislature doesn't have 
grounds to sue. 
Cotchett said a recent federal appellate ruling that the city of San Diego 
can join in a lawsuit against FERC means that "any consumer that purchases 
power in California" may sue. 
"We're talking lives of people here. This is the lives of senior citizens and 
everyone else who uses power," Cotchett said. At the least, the suit will 
"let them know California means business." 
FERC has said it is already acting to rein in high power prices but 
California can't afford to wait, Cotchett said. "This state can't put up with 
the carnage." 
That's a tough argument to win, said Stephen Angle, FERC attorney for 14 
years who now represents power generators on non-California issues. 
Procedures to appeal FERC rulings in the courts exist, but asking a federal 
judge to overrule an independent regulatory body in a pending case isn't one 
of them, Angle said. 
"It's not something courts like to do. It's a very high standard and there 
are very few cases where it's happened," Angle said. "It's a very high hurdle 
to get over." 
100% windfall tax urged for high-priced electricity 
SACRAMENTO - California would impose a 100 percent "windfall profits tax" on 
high-priced electricity under a bill approved by the Senate on Monday. 
That would in effect impose a state cap on power prices in the absence of the 
hard federal cap state officials have sought for months from the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission. 
"Obviously the best way to enact a rate cap is for FERC to do its job. They 
have refused to listen to our pleas," said Sen. Jack Scott, D-Altadena. 
"We're faced, as the state of California, with solving the problem 
ourselves." 
The bill, which now goes to the Assembly, would impose the 100 percent tax on 
any power priced over a baseline price of $80 a megawatt hour, a fraction of 
what electricity has sometimes sold for in recent months. 
The measure gives the California Public Utilities Commission 60 days to 
revise the $80 price threshold. Companies could exceed the baseline price if 
they can prove they must to recoup their costs and a "reasonable" profit. It 
does not affect existing power contracts. 
"We ought to be laying out a welcome mat for these power generators. What 
we're laying down is a spike pad," objected Sen. Ray Haynes, R-Riverside. 
"It sends a message that California is not a good place to do business," said 
Brian O'Neel, a spokesman for generator Mirant. 
Gov. Gray Davis has said he is amenable to signing a windfall profits bill. 
Janitors told to clean up their energy-savings act 
LOS ANGELES - Gov. Gray Davis on Monday enlisted janitors in an energy-saving 
campaign in which they will turn out lights and urge energy conservation in 
buildings they clean. 
"Everyone must do their part so that we can get through this summer without 
major disruptions," the governor told a Los Angeles news conference. 
The janitors are part of a plan calling for cooperation from landlords, 
employers and workers to conserve power to protect the state from blackouts 
this summer. 
"I would now challenge all commercial building owners up and down this state 
to do their part and help us through this energy crisis," Davis said. 
With current participants, the plan could achieve a 10 percent power savings 
in 2,500 buildings encompassing 300 million square feet of commercial space, 
Davis said. 
"My friends, we are in a war with energy companies, mostly from Texas and the 
Southwest, who are charging us outrageous prices for the cost of 
electricity," Davis told about 50 janitors from Service Employees 
International Union. 
"Our best short-term remedy ... against price gouging and summer blackouts is 
conservation," he said. 
Janitors will be asked to help by cleaning one floor of a building at a time, 
turning off lights when they're done and leaving notes for workers who have 
left computers and other equipment on. 
Yolanda Umana, a janitor who works in downtown Los Angeles at night, said she 
agreed that cleaning crews should participate in conservation efforts. 
"We're part of the building, just as the tenants are, and I think we can 
share in the responsibility," she said through a translator. 
In other news Monday: 
The governor said he's "very, very close" to a deal with San Diego Gas & 
Electric to purchase the utility's transmission lines. Davis said he hopes to 
have it finalized by the end of the week. "These negotiations do not move in 
a straight line," he said. "You make progress, then you get detoured, you get 
back on track, then you get detoured, but I believe we are very, very close 
to resolving that issue." 
About 200 people showed up at a Public Utilities Commission hearing in Santa 
Monica to ask state regulators for a break from the largest electricity rate 
increase in state history. The PUC in March approved rate increase of up to 
36 percent for customers of Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern 
California Edison. The commission has scheduled 11 public hearings on the 
issue around the state and could implement the hikes as early as next month. 
The state initiated a new Web site, www.flexyourpower.ca.gov/rebates, to help 
consumers, businesses, farmers, cities and counties make use of rebates and 
other conservation programs. The site allows consumers to search for 
energy-efficiency programs offered by any public agency and their local 
utility district. The same information is available by calling (800) 555-7794 
during business hours.

Energy borrowing OKd 
Democrats in Assembly support the $13.4 billion bond over GOP opposition. 
May 8, 2001 
By JOHN HOWARD
and HANH KIM QUACH
The Orange County Register 
SACRAMENTO - Democrats in a sharply divided Assembly on Monday pushed through 
a record $13.4 billion in borrowing to cover California's emergency 
electricity purchases - despite Republican fears that the scheme would do 
little to provide new energy and could jeopardize the state's financial 
standing. 
As blackouts rolled across the state, giving a heightened sense of urgency to 
deliberations, the Assembly voted 49-29 along partisan lines for what amounts 
to the largest state borrowing package in California history. 
The bill, SB31x by Senate leader John Burton, D-San Francisco, was sent to 
the Senate, where it could be taken up as soon as today. 
Under the plan, the bonds would be sold to investors who would be repaid 
through money collected from 10 million California utility ratepayers on 
their monthly bills over 15 years. 
Proceeds from the bond sale would enable the state's main treasury, the 
General Fund, to be kept whole for more spending on programs "such as 
education or transportation or environmental protection or child care," said 
Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek. 
But Republicans said the bond debt was at least $5 billion too high, could 
stress the state's long-term creditworthiness and did nothing to produce more 
energy. They refused to support it. 
"Passing this $13.4 billion bond issue does not increase generation, it does 
not increase conservation. We still do not have a game plan about how we're 
going to spend $13.4 billion," said Assembly Republican Leader Dave Cox of 
Fair Oaks. The next-largest bond sale was $9.2 billion in education bonds 
approved by voters in November 1998. 
Although not detailed, the Democrats' plan would use some of the proceeds to 
pay for the $6.7 billion already spent or allocated for emergency energy 
purchases and another portion to pay for future energy locked up under 
long-term contracts. 
Democrats control both houses of the Legislature but lack two-thirds 
majorities - the margin needed, with the governor's signature, to authorize 
bonds to go to market immediately. The Republican opposition meant Democrats 
could win approval of the bonds but delayed the bill's effective date until 
August. 
The potential delay raised new problems. The state Department of Water 
Resources, which purchases electricity on behalf of the weakened utilities, 
said the bonds have to be issued by July 1. If not, some of the companies 
that agreed to sell power to the state at relatively low rates could legally 
back out of their contracts. It was not clear whether any of the cheaper 
energy would be lost to the state by missing the July 1 deadline. 
Keeley said the Assembly speaker's office was trying to determine whether the 
bonds could be marketed earlier. 
The governor was angered at Republican opposition. 
"The Republican Party that brought us this disastrous energy deregulation 
scheme is now obstructing its solution," Gov. Gray Davis said. Democrats also 
said failure to approve the bonds could force the 2001-02 state budget, which 
is supposed to be signed into law by July 1, to be delayed or rewritten. 
But Cox said the state should "write off" $5 billion in losses and float a 
bond issue of no greater than $8 billion. 
"We've got some cash in our pocket; let's use it to pay down that $13 
billion," he added.

Jones has bright ideas on electricity 
In a Democrat-dominated state, Republican Secretary of State Bill Jones' plan 
to pull California out of its ongoing electricity crisis is unlikely to get 
serious consideration. That's especially true given that Mr. Jones is a 
likely contender for Gov. Gray Davis' office. 
Still, Mr. Jones has detailed the most reasonable plan so far for dealing 
with the current mess in a way that moves in the right direction - toward 
freer markets rather than government controls. His analysis is the first one 
in a while that doesn't use demagogy to shift blame from California 
politicians to Evil Out of State Power Generators.
In a May 2 letter to Vice President Dick Cheney, Mr. Jones captured the 
nature and the seriousness of the problem: "California is on the brink of 
fiscal insolvency. Our state budget has moved rapidly from an $8 billion 
surplus to a potential deficit situation and our credit rating has been 
downgraded two levels, which puts us 49th out of the 50 states. This is a 
failure of leadership - and the cost is staggering."
He argues, correctly, that although Gov. Davis did not cause the problem, his 
approach is only exacerbating it by attempting to "socialize" the electricity 
market, and by keeping secret spending and deal-making decisions that will 
affect Californians for years.
Specifically, Mr. Jones wants to keep California out of the power business. 
Instead of creating a state-run system, he said the government should restore 
the utilities to fiscal health by calling on creditors to "accept a reduction 
in accounts receivable in exchange for immediate payment of past-due debts." 
He would also let the state provide low-interest loans to help utilities pay 
their debts, using company assets as collateral rather than having the state 
take over costly-to-maintain power lines.
He would impose a temporary rate cap until additional power sources come on 
the market, with the ultimate goal of removing the cap and allowing the 
marketplace to kick in. He calls for tax incentives so that utilities offer 
pricing meters that charge more for peak electricity usage and less for 
non-peak hour use. Furthermore, the Jones plan encourages a variety of tax 
and regulatory changes to encourage the creation of new generating capacity 
as well as conservation efforts.
Some of his regulatory proposals sound reasonable, but offer only added 
layers of bureaucracy. He calls for more federal involvement than we would 
like to see. And some of the proposals need to be detailed to determine their 
usefulness. And, of course, it will be interesting to see what energy and 
policy experts say about the plan on closer analysis.
Still, despite the obvious political motives involved here, the Jones 
proposals put some of the best market-based proposals on the table at a time 
when government solutions seem to be the only ones seriously addressed in the 
Legislature and governor's office.
Perhaps the crisis is serious enough that legislators will be willing to 
consider any good ideas - no matter where they come from.

[B] Calif. ISO says power blackouts this evening unlikely



By Christine Cordner

San Francisco, May 7 (BridgeNews) - California is not expected to see power
outages this evening since the state is receiving 1,600 megawatts of imported
power from a Canadian province, said Jim McIntosh, California Independent
System Operator Director of Operations, Monday. He said that the state was
prepared to initiate rolling blackouts earlier in the day before the Canadian
supplier came though.



*                     *              *



"If imports remain where they are, we don't anticipate any supply
problems....We can handle it,"  McIntosh said during a conference call.


McIntosh said that Tuesday's supply situation looks similar to Monday.


The ISO issued a Stage 2 emergency this morning when power supplies dipped
below 5%. McIntosh said that the ISO was very close to initiating a Stage 3
emergency, which allows it to ask utilities to cut off customers' power.


California has already seen the consequences of Stage 3--rolling blackouts
Jan. 17 and 18 and then again March 19 and 20.


Monday's problems stemmed from high temperatures increasing demand in the
state as well as increased demand in Southwest states that import power. In
addition, several key power plants were closed for pre-summer maintenance. End





Stage 2 Electrical Emergency Declared; SCE to Curtail 'Load' for Some 
Customers



ROSEMEAD, Calif., May 7 /PRNewswire/  via NewsEdge Corporation  -
The California Independent System
Operator (Cal-ISO) declared a Stage 2 Emergency this morning, due to low power
reserves and increased demand for power because of rising temperatures.  The
agency called upon Southern California Edison and other investor-owned
utilities to begin voluntary "load" curtailment programs for certain customers
within their service areas.


Cal-ISO said the Stage 2 Emergency would be in effect from 10 a.m. to
midnight.  Cal-ISO and SCE are making urgent appeals for all customers to
immediately reduce their electricity consumption so that reserve levels do not
deteriorate further.


To achieve this load reduction during Stage 2, SCE is required to activate
its voluntary load curtailment program, under which large industrial,
commercial, and agricultural customers have agreed to temporarily curtail
electricity usage during an electrical emergency in exchange for reduced
rates.


Should the situation worsen for any reason, and power reserves drop below
1.5%, Cal-ISO could declare a Stage 3 Emergency, the most critical status.
Cal-ISO could direct utilities to "drop load," necessitating involuntary
rolling blackouts for groups of customers across their service areas until
sufficient reserve levels are achieved.


SCE customers are asked to reduce power consumption by turning off any
unneeded electrical appliances and lights, especially during the state's daily
peak consumption period -- 1 p.m. to 5 p.m.


Following are some effective ways customers can reduce their power use and
not be greatly inconvenienced:


LARGE ENERGY USERS


-- turn off all auxiliary or redundant machinery where possible;


-- consider shifting or staggering operations outside the hours of highest


electrical demand, typically noon to 6 p.m.;


AIR CONDITIONERS


-- set thermostats no lower than 78 degrees (F);


-- use electric fans instead of air conditioning if practical;


-- avoid using evaporative coolers or humidifiers at the same time an air


conditioner is running;


-- avoid cooling unoccupied rooms;


-- open windows during evening hours to take advantage of cool breezes;


APPLIANCES AND TOOLS


-- delay until evening hours the optional use of appliances (dishwashers,


clothes washers and dryers), chargers, power tools, and electrical


equipment;


REFRIGERATORS AND FREEZERS


-- avoid unnecessarily opening refrigerators;


-- keep your refrigerator or freezer set at the proper temperature;


-- be sure to use the "power-saver" switch if your refrigerator has one;


-- keep the condenser coils behind or beneath your refrigerator/freezer


clean (refrigerators represent approximately 25% of the electric bill


for a typical residence);


ADDITIONAL TIPS


-- run swimming pool equipment during early morning and evening hours;


and;


-- limit the reopening of a refrigerator, which is a major user of


electricity in most homes;


-- use drapes and blinds to keep out direct sunlight;


-- replace incandescent light bulbs with ENERGY Star(R) qualified compact


fluorescent bulbs;


-- always wash a full load of clothes or use the variable water level


adjustment for smaller loads;


-- be sure your home has adequate insulation.

Rolling Blackouts Hit California



By JENNIFER COLEMAN
Associated Press Writer




SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) _ As temperatures soared to record
levels in parts of California, blackouts cut electricity to more
than 100,000 customers in what power grid operators warned was a
preview of summer.


Hour-long outages, ordered by power grid managers, hit portions
of selected cities Monday for the first time since March as
California slipped off the tightrope of electrical supply and
demand for the fifth time this year.


Signal lights went dark, rush-hour traffic jammed and police
officers were dispatched to control intersections. No major
incidents were reported.


The state remained in a Stage 2 power alert _ one step below the
threshold for blackouts _ until midnight Monday. Grid managers,
however, warned that conditions remained ``subject to change'' with
little notice. More heat was expected as high pressure dominated
the West.


Before the blackouts, the Independent System Operator urged
conservation because warm weather across the West was pushing up
demand for electricity. Imported power was scarce and several key
plants, including nuclear generating stations, were down for
pre-summer maintenance.


The ISO managed to stave off a late-morning threat of blackouts
by asking for cutbacks from ``interruptible'' customers who get
cheaper electricity rates in exchange for scaling back power use
during emergencies.


``We were able to take off the interruptible, but only for so
long,'' ISO spokeswoman Lorie O'Donley said. ``Then they started
coming back on and the temperatures were still high.''


The mercury climbed to a record 93 degrees in San Francisco,
while in the south, temperatures topped 100 in the deserts and a
record was set in Lancaster at 96 degrees.


``We expected demand to peak between 3 and 4 p.m. and it
didn't,'' O'Donley said. ``It just continued to climb.''


Grid managers ordered utilities to cut 300 megawatts between 5
p.m. and 6 p.m. One megawatt is enough to power about 750 homes.


Utility giant Pacific Gas and Electric Co. cut off about 54,000
customers in Northern and Central California. An additional 36,000
commercial, industrial and residential customers of Southern
California Edison were affected in portions of 40 communities.


San Diego Gas &amp; Electric cut power to about 8,600 customers in
Orange County, El Cajon and areas of San Diego. The Sacramento
Municipal Utility District cut 18 megawatts, affecting about 4,600
customers in southern Sacramento County.


Tight electricity supplies and high demand led to two days of
rolling blackouts Jan. 17 and 18 in Northern California. The ISO
ordered statewide blackouts March 19 and 20 because of scarce power
supplies.


The utilities blame the crisis on 1996 deregulation legislation
designed to open up California's electricity market to competition.
Among other things, the law temporarily capped the rate the state's
largest utilities could charge customers even while they were
forced to pay soaring prices for wholesale electricity.


In April, PG&amp;E filed for bankruptcy. SoCal Edison is teetering
on the edge of insolvency.







Updated 5/8/01

dtodd@ftenergy.com
As political battle lines tighten in anticipation of the Bush 
administration's announcement this month of a national energy strategy to 
buttress the country's economic development, some of America's largest 
industry associations are expressing deep concern about the possibility of 
being caught on the wrong side of public opinion across the country.

That fear sparked a move by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and like-minded 
economic development groups, manufacturing councils and energy utilities and 
producers to establish the Alliance for Energy and Economic Growth (AEEG). 
The alliance's aim: persuade a host of other institutions, corporate America 
at large and, ultimately, the public that its collective future lies in the 
balance because the "energy crisis" is no mirage. 

In an interview with Energy Insight, a key player in putting together the 
AEEG, U.S. Chamber of Commerce Executive Vice President Bruce Josten, 
explained its purpose and immediate objectives. Josten, the chamber's senior 
government and political affairs officer as well as second highest-ranking 
official, maintained that the business community has done a weak job, by and 
large, of explaining energy-related concerns. And, more worrisome still, it 
has failed to see beyond specific sector concerns to consider "over the 
horizon" energy issues threatening to adversely affect industry and the 
nation's economy as a whole.


"Freelance lobbying" and "cannibalistic tendencies" of different segments of 
the energy industry have been a significant part of the problem, Josten 
contends. The fact that "we haven't built a refinery in this country in 25 
years, or the fact that today we have half the number of refineries we had 25 
years ago only addresses one side or a sliver of this issue."

So how can the alliance make a difference? It's all about education, said 
Josten, as he began rattling off statistics.

Educating consumers.
"You sit here, if you're me, and you wonder: Do the American people know that 
since the Arab oil embargo (of the early 1970s) energy use per dollar of GDP 
has dropped by about 40%? Do they know that a single car today produces less 
air pollution than a fleet of 20 fuel-efficient cars did 30 years ago? Do 
they know that the amount of energy they are using in their homes for heat, 
light and appliances has decreased by a little bit more than 25%? Do they 
know that air conditioners today are using 50% less energy to produce the 
same amount of cooling as air conditioners (a generation go)? Do they know 
that the average refrigerator today costs 40 bucks versus about $110 or $120 
on an annual basis to run then?"

The Arlington, Va.-based Electronics Industry Alliance, a national trade body 
that represents the full spectrum of U.S. manufacturers in the more than $500 
billion electronics industry, is a key player in the AEEG. The group 
represents companies ranging from makers of complex tiny electronic 
components for the defense industry to consumer products such as appliances. 
Headed by former seven-term Oklahoma U.S. congressman and once House 
Intelligence Committee Chairman Dave McCurdy, the Electronics Industry 
Alliance is a key backer of Vice President Dick Cheney's approach of framing 
national energy policy in a national security context.

But the necessity of linking energy security to economic growth in the 
public's mind, as the AEEG intends, will be rooted in down-to-earth concepts, 
said Josten. "We think we have a unique role in defining the problems and 
educating the American people to the gigantic strides that have been made (in 
terms of energy efficiency) and to get them to understand just what's in 
their homes today versus what was in their homes even a decade ago."

In terms of the bigger picture: "You just cannot continue to have the kind of 
GDP growth that we have enjoyed as a country without energy to fuel it. You 
can't have the ability to pay for the kinds of environmental performance 
(improvements) that we want and seek, nor can you have the kind of 
technological innovation that we want and seek unless of course you have a 
growing and prosperous economy with the ability to pay for those items," he 
said. Josten added that his political take on the situation is that the 
environmental community is gearing up to "pummel" the Bush administration for 
opening up natural resources in the U.S.

For all the "gyrations in the stock market" in recent months and anxiety 
about an economic downturn as consumer confidence indices have dropped, "New 
jobs were still growing, and up until a month ago were still outpacing job 
losses," he observed. However, continued erosion in consumer confidence 
creates the risk of "creating a recession."

Some critics "are going to accuse (AEEG) of basically being a front or a 
shill for the (Bush) administration in one way or another," he acknowledged. 
"On the other side of that, this issue is so big that the need to build and 
develop a national consensus, for the need to have a sound and sustainable 
national energy policy, is going to require a cacophony of different voices, 
comprised of consumers and producers."

Josten said his role is to try to help get industry across the nation to 
start singing from, as he calls it, "the same hymn sheet." His choice of the 
word "cacophony" can only be interpreted as an invitation to bring on the 
dissonant voices.

THE NATION THE ENRON INQUIRY Now, the $51-Million Severance Question Pay: Enron's Chapter 11 status may jeopardize compensation for ex-CEO Kenneth Lay.

Ousted Enron Chief Executive Kenneth L. Lay could get a severance package worth at least $25 million--and perhaps exceeding $51 million--although his ability to collect that payday is clouded by the company's Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. 
Lay, who resigned Wednesday under fire, also could get parting gifts that include a lifetime annual pension of nearly $475,000, a $12-million life insurance policy and payment of taxes on any severance pay.
But Lay may never see a dime because, with most of Enron Corp.'s operations tangled in U.S. Bankruptcy Court, he slipped overnight from corporate commander to yet another among the thousands of Enron creditors. 
"I would be incredulous if he got any money, and if he did take any money he'd be spending the entire amount on bodyguards," compensation expert Graef Crystal said. 
Lay, who received more than $200 million in compensation from Enron since 1999, has been accused of misleading shareholders about Enron's finances as it plunged toward ruin last year. 
In his 15 years building Enron from a small pipeline company to the world's largest energy trader, Lay was paid handsomely, and his severance agreement and other benefits reflect that, according to documents on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Exactly how much Lay might receive in severance is only vaguely spelled out in Enron's most recent proxy statement, filed with the SEC in March. Enron representatives declined to clarify the matter and hinted that the payout might not be a sure thing. 
"The terms of Mr. Lay's separation are still being determined," Enron spokesman Vance Meyer said. 
Three Times His Salary and Bonus, Plus 
Lay's severance is based on payments he received in 2000, multiplied by the three full calendar years left on his contract. That means Lay would be entitled to a lump sum of about $25 million, or three times his 2000 salary of $1.3 million and bonus of $7 million. 
That $25-million tab would be further swelled by an unspecified "long-term grant value" received in 2000, according to the proxy statement. Compensation experts said that could include the $7.5 million of restricted stock and a $1.2-million cash payment that Lay also received in 2000, which Enron called "long-term compensation." 
If that assessment is correct, the total payout would be $51 million. 
The SEC filing also said that Lay is entitled to a lifetime pension that would have been valued at $475,042 if Lay, 59, had stayed until 65. In addition, the company said it would pay all taxes on Lay's severance if the IRS rules that the severance package is an "excess parachute payment." 
What is more, Lay, as of the end of 2001, owns a $12-million life insurance policy that Enron helped him buy, according to Lay's 1996 employment agreement, also filed with the SEC. 
Lay also remains as an Enron director, and they are paid at least $50,000 a year. 
Compensation experts said it is unlikely Lay will get his severance package and most of his pension because all preexisting contracts are invalidated by the bankruptcy filing and the fact that Lay technically resigned, rather than being terminated. But the refusal of the company to rule out a severance is "troublesome," Crystal said. 
In any event, even as Enron was hiding losses in a murky series of off-the-books partnerships and using questionable accounting on its way to the nation's largest bankruptcy filing, the company served another purpose that nearly was hidden from public view: It effectively was a personal bank for Ken Lay. 
The company last year provided Lay with an unusual line of credit of as much as $7.5 million that he used repeatedly, often to help cover soured investments he made elsewhere, his lawyer has said. This despite the fact that Lay has received more than $200 million in compensation from Enron since 1999. 
And the collateral securing the line of credit apparently was Lay's own Enron stock, shares of which were showered on him by the thousands either directly or through stock options that were part of his compensation package during Enron's explosive growth in the late 1990s. 
Lay typically repaid the credit line with his Enron shares, then would draw down the loan again and repeat the process, Earl Silbert, Lay's lawyer, said. Lay did this on 15 occasions between February and October, just as Enron's collapse was accelerating. 
Lay Expected to Face Huge Legal Bills 
Lay's apparent financial problems, signaled by his repeated tapping of the credit line, are compounded by the specter of huge personal legal bills facing him. Lay is the subject of more than 50 lawsuits resulting from Enron's financial meltdown, as well as numerous federal investigations. 
His credit line is a perk that has surprised several experts in executive compensation, a field already chock-full of various stock options, bonuses and other benefits paid to Corporate America's leaders. 
To have a standing credit line for an executive who can pay back the loan with stock the company has awarded him is "very unusual," said Alan Johnson, managing director of Johnson Associates, a compensation consultant in New York. The arrangement, approved by Enron's board, allowed Lay "to treat the company as a personal piggy bank," he said. 
Bill Coleman, senior vice president of compensation at Salary.com, an Internet compensation site, said that "there is something fundamentally odd about a company loaning money to an executive and collateralizing it with the company's own stock." 
"Why is Enron in the business of loaning money?" he asked. 
Company Loans to Top Management 
It is common for a company to make one-time loans to senior managers--say to help them relocate or to buy the company's shares. Sometimes corporations will even waive the interest, or total repayment, as part of the executive's future compensation. Indeed, Enron in 1997 made a $4-million loan to Jeffrey K. Skilling, its chief executive who abruptly quit in August. 
Also, the dollar amount of Lay's credit line isn't sizable relative to the billions of dollars of debt that sank Enron. After a series of financial setbacks that sent its stock plunging and eroded investors' confidence, Enron filed for Bankruptcy Court protection Dec. 2, citing more than $31 billion in debt and $50 billion in assets. 
The stock, which traded around $80 a share a year ago, now trades for just pennies, and the options that Lay and others still have are virtually worthless. 
Silbert did not return calls requesting elaboration on Lay's arrangement, and Enron spokesman Meyer said he could provide no further details. 
No one has suggested that Lay's arrangement involved any wrongdoing, and Enron's proxy statement last year disclosed--in two sentences--that the credit line existed. About the same time that the proxy appeared, in March, was when Lay was starting to use the credit line repeatedly. 
He typically repaid it by returning shares of his Enron stock to the company, said Silbert, who said he made the public disclosure to offset speculation that Lay was aggressively dumping shares because the executive knew the company was headed toward disaster. 
But that disclosure--coming on top of so many other revelations, including that some top Enron executives had financial interests in partnerships that helped finance Enron's operations--adds to the appearance that "there is an awful lot of self-dealing going on in this case, and this is symptomatic of that," said Rajesh Aggarwal, an assistant business professor at Dartmouth College. 
In September, at the same time Lay was using his Enron stock to support his line of credit, he urged company employees to buy more shares only weeks before Enron disclosed the worst financial results in its history. 
The stock then was selling for about $25 a share, and two months later for $4 a share. The stock's collapse wiped out billions of dollars of investor holdings and the retirement savings of Enron employees who owned the stock. 
In general, Lay's credit-line arrangement "is not one that's shareholder friendly," said Salary.com's Coleman. The whole point of executive compensation is to give top managers incentives to build the company and boost its stock price for all shareholders, he said, yet Lay's credit line gave him protection from having to reach into his own wallet even when Enron's stock nose-dived. 
"He doesn't get hurt," Coleman said. 
The credit line served another purpose not afforded the average Enron stockholder, said Kevin Murphy, a finance professor at USC. Letting Lay repay his credit line with Enron stock "allowed him to get liquidity out of his stock that was easier than going to the open market," he said. In other words, Lay didn't have to first sell $4 million or so of Enron shares on the stock exchange--an event that likely would have depressed Enron's price on the market--each time to pay back his Enron loans. 
"That gives him an advantage that most stockholders don't have," Murphy said. 
The credit line also raises questions about the amount of risk Lay was personally accepting at the same time he was leading Enron's fight for survival. 
It's unclear why, in light of his enormous compensation at Enron, he was having to repeatedly tap his credit line. 
Besides his salary and bonuses, Lay realized $43.8 million from stock options that he cashed in during 1999, and $123.4 million from exercising options in 2000, according to Enron's government filings. 
Lay sometimes borrowed from his Enron line of credit last year when he expected to face margin calls from other lenders, Silbert has said. That meant he had bought other investments partly with borrowed funds--or on "margin"--and now had to repay some or all of those amounts because their underlying investments had tumbled in value. 
Lay recently put several properties up for sale, including vacation homes in Aspen, Colo. 
Now that Lay is gone, Enron is searching for a restructuring specialist to run the company. Sources close to the company said an interim chief executive will be announced in the next few days. 
Enron reportedly has narrowed the candidates for its interim chief executive, and the front-runners are three New York companies that specialize in corporate turnarounds, according to Bloomberg News. Those companies--Alvarez & Marsal, Glass & Associates and Zolfo Cooper--all declined to comment.

Accounting for Enron: Enron's Top Choice For Acting CEO Is Stephen Cooper
By Rebecca Smith and Joann S. Lublin

Reorganization specialist Stephen F. Cooper is the front-runner to be named acting chief executive of Enron Corp., following the resignation earlier this week of Kenneth Lay as chairman and CEO, people close to the matter said. 
Mr. Cooper, a managing principal of Zolfo Cooper, a 20-year-old consulting firm that specializes in bankruptcy reorganization, is set to fly to Houston from New York today along with Tom Roberts, Enron's counsel at Weil Gotschal & Manges, these people said.
Mr. Cooper, who couldn't be reached, is scheduled to meet with senior management during the next few days. Enron's board could confirm his appointment as soon as today, but more likely will act during the weekend. Mr. Cooper, who has worked with Federated Department Stores Inc., Morrison Knudsen Corp. and a host of other companies, "is one of those guys who's done bankruptcies his whole life," said one person familiar with the situation. "You don't want somebody learning on the job with a bankruptcy this big." 
If Mr. Cooper is named, the board next will turn its attention to finding a chairman. 
While Enron wants a chief executive who will manage its complicated day-to-day operations and shepherd the firm through bankruptcy, which it entered on Dec. 2, the board is seeking a chairman who can play a different role. One person said the chairman's post -- for which there is no clear front-runner yet -- will be offered to someone who can act as the company's ambassador to Washington, where Enron is being investigated by nine congressional committees, the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Mr. Lay stepped down at the request of Enron's bankruptcy creditors' committee after it said it had lost faith in the energy company's management. Whoever is named as CEO is expected to work closely with Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey McMahon, who has been the firm's public face in recent weeks after the departure of Enron's former finance chief, Andrew Fastow.

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE COMPANY'S FUTURE
Trying to Salvage What Can Be Salvaged While the Creditors Line Up

When he resigned as chairman and chief executive of Enron on Wednesday under pressure from outside creditors, Kenneth L. Lay said he was stepping aside to ensure the survival of the company. But as Enron tries to sort through creditors' claims and to tally the billions of dollars in debt parked off its balance sheet, its chances of surviving, even in a greatly diminished form, remain far from certain. 
The creditors' committee, which represents the big banks and other companies Enron owes, wants to extract the greatest value from the assets remaining. So do the company's own lawyers. But to do so probably will require selling off most, if not all, of what the company still owns, industry analysts and energy executives said.
''There's a high likelihood that it just gets liquidated and never gets out of Chapter 11,'' said Andre Meade, a senior energy analyst with Commerzbank. ''Enron doesn't have a business with a critical mass that it could be reorganized around.'' 
The company is moving quickly to hire an outside executive who specializes in restructuring bankrupt companies, said Martin J. Bienenstock of Weil Gotshal & Manges, the law firm that is representing Enron in the bankruptcy proceedings. Mr. Bienenstock declined to identify the candidates for the job. But he said the list had been narrowed to three executives, at most, and that Enron would probably announce its decision in less than a week. 
Right now, Enron is being run day to day by Jeffrey McMahon, who was elevated to chief financial officer to replace Andrew S. Fastow, who was forced out last fall after his role in managing the off-the-books partnerships that contributed to Enron's fall came to light. 
Mr. McMahon is working alongside Raymond M. Bowen Jr., the treasurer, and Stan Horton, who is in charge of gas pipeline operations. 
''The creditors' committee thinks this is a step in the right direction to maximize value for all creditors,'' said Luc Despins of Milbank Tweed Hadley & McCloy, which represents the committee. 
Exactly how Enron's value will be maximized at the hands of its lawyers and creditors will determine the future shape of the company. When it filed for bankruptcy protection on Dec. 2, Enron reported that it had $50 billion in assets and $31 billion in debt. But many industry experts are skeptical of the claims that its assets are fairly valued, given how misleading Enron's accounting has turned out to be. 
Moreover, the reported debt does not include transactions that were kept off the books by the company to inflate its profits, Mr. Bienenstock said. The $50 billion in assets includes contracts in its trading and power marketing businesses, industry analysts said. But with its trading operation paralyzed ever since the bankruptcy, no one knows what those deals are really worth. 
The sell-off at Enron has already begun. The company recently turned over its energy trading business to UBS Warburg. In return for assuming the contracts of about 600 employees and acquiring things like computers and proprietary software, UBS Warburg will give Enron a third of its profits over the next 10 years, although it has an option to buy out Enron's claim early. It made no upfront payments. 
Enron still owns the network of natural gas pipelines that it began with in the mid-1980's. But that business, while profitable, is far smaller than the other units at the company. It also has a utility in Portland, Ore., that is being sold. Enron's overseas holdings, widely considered money-losers, include a troubled power plant in Dabhol, India, and a utility in Argentina. 
''The main business, the one anyone would really care about -- their trading business -- they sold to UBS,'' said Gordon Howald, an energy analyst with Credit Lyonnais. ''Their international portfolio is horrible. Their broadband business has been disbanded. There is very, very little of value left.'' 
But Mr. Bienenstock contended that through a mix of asset sales and consolidation of remaining business, some version of Enron can still survive. Enron's lawyers are discussing with the creditors' committee the best way to sell those businesses that they think are worth the most intact while trying to rebuild others that might bring profits and revenue in the future. Those remaining businesses would form the core of a new company in which creditors would receive equity positions. 
At the same time, Enron faces a sea of shareholder and employee losses. Mr. Bienenstock said those suing for mismanagement of 401(k) retirement accounts would have the same rights as creditors with unsecured debt. But those charging stock fraud would be at the back of the creditors' line, along with Enron shareholders. Still, such plaintiffs retain the right to pursue lawsuits against Arthur Andersen and individual officers and board members of Enron. 
''The creditors' committee is economically rational,'' Mr. Bienenstock said, explaining why he does not think that Enron will melt away in a fire sale. ''If the shares in a reorganized company are more valuable than selling the assets immediately, the creditors will take the shares.''

Andersen Knew of `Fraud' Risk at Enron --- October E-Mail Shows Firm Anticipated Problems Before Company's Fall
By Tom Hamburger and Jonathan Weil

Arthur Andersen LLP analysts determined during the fall that there was significantly "heightened risk of financial-statement fraud" at Enron Corp., a newly released document shows. 
That determination came from a test on the Houston energy company's financial statements described in an Oct. 9 e-mail sent by Mark Zajac, a risk-management employee in Chicago, to Andersen auditors on the Enron account. Michigan Rep. John Dingell, the senior Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, released the e-mail as the panel's investigations subcommittee opened hearings on Enron's collapse.
At the hearing, which focused on document destruction at Andersen, firm executives acknowledged that they retained a law firm in early October in part because they feared being sued over Enron -- but waited another month before telling the Houston office to preserve Enron-related documents. 
Andersen's lead Enron auditor, David Duncan, was fired this month for allegedly overseeing a massive document-destruction effort after the Securities and Exchange Commission opened an inquiry into Enron's accounting practices in late October. Yesterday, Andersen acknowledged that personnel outside Houston also destroyed documents. 
The Zajac e-mail provides another indication that Mr. Duncan and other Andersen auditors were increasingly uncomfortable with Enron's practices as it spiraled toward collapse. The e-mail also offers a clue to Mr. Duncan's state of mind as he and his subordinates were shredding documents. The e-mail was dated a week before a previously disclosed Oct. 15 memo that recounted Mr. Duncan warning Enron that its upcoming third-quarter earnings announcement might be misleading. The Oct. 16 earnings news release characterized $1.01 billion of losses as "nonrecurring charges," a characterization Mr. Duncan opposed. 
Mr. Zajac's analysis was based on a "financial statement fraud risk identification" test. Such tests are routine in auditing, but the Enron results weren't. Mr. Zajac wrote that a complete test was impossible because sufficient data about administrative expenses were lacking. But a test of the rest of Enron's financial statements triggered a "red alert: a heightened risk of financial fraud." Mr. Zajac's e-mail explained that such red alerts sometimes are false alarms, but must be taken seriously because the risk of fraud is "significantly heightened." 
The results were relayed to Mr. Duncan a month before Enron announced on Nov. 19 that it would restate its financial statements going back to 1997, cumulatively reducing earnings by nearly $600 million. "In the context of the Enron debacle, this is tantamount to yelling that the barn door is open long after the horses have fled the scene and shown up in the next county," Rep. Dingell wrote in a letter to Andersen Chief Executive Joseph Berardino inquiring about the matter. 
Andersen spokesman Charlie Leonard said he didn't know what actions its auditors took to address the "red alert." But he emphasized that Andersen had been conducting the particular test referred to in the e-mail only "on an experimental basis" since 2000 and that past runs "have shown that it needs further refinement," especially when applied to companies such as Enron. 
At the hearing, Andersen officials continued to pin responsibility for the shredding on Mr. Duncan and his Houston team, but committee members peppered them with questions and evidence aimed at shifting the blame toward Chicago headquarters. 
Andersen's internal "investigation indicated that [Mr. Duncan] directed the purposeful destruction of a very substantial volume of documents," said C.E. Andrews, Andersen's global managing partner. "This is the kind of conduct that Andersen cannot tolerate." 
Subcommittee Chairman James Greenwood, a Pennsylvania Republican, remained skeptical as the hearing closed: "What I got after four hours here is a larger question of whether Mr. Duncan is a fall guy for others at Arthur Andersen." 
The hearing provided the most detailed chronology yet of the circumstances surrounding the document destruction. 
Members focused much of their questioning on the decision to hire the New York law firm of Davis Polk & Wardwell, which was retained Oct. 9 -- the same day as Mr. Zajac's e-mail about financial fraud -- and now represents Andersen in Enron litigation. Mr. Andrews said the firm was retained to help deal with Enron financial-reporting issues as well as "possible litigation." By then, headquarters officials already were aware of a whistleblower's allegations of possible fraud at Enron. 
On Oct. 12, Andersen attorney Nancy Temple sent an e-mail from Chicago to remind the Houston office of the firm's document-retention policy, which calls for preserving final audit papers but destroying nearly all other records unless litigation is "threatened." By about that time, Ms. Temple testified she had learned of the whistleblower's allegations, too, but she rejected suggestions that the reminder amounted to a document-destruction order. She insisted she was merely responding to questions in prior conference calls "about how to appropriately document several different matters." 
Three days after sending that e-mail, Ms. Temple had her first discussions with lawyers from Davis Polk about the Enron matter, which included document-retention issues. That same day, Ms. Temple asked the Houston office in an e-mail to remove her name from a draft memo, in part because she didn't want to be called as a "witness." Ms. Temple explained that she was afraid that, because the memo discussed advice she offered, the inclusion of a reference to her might breach attorney-client privilege. 
On Oct. 22, the SEC announced an informal inquiry into Enron. The next day, Ms. Temple testified, she and Mr. Duncan talked by telephone. Ms. Temple said her notes indicate that Mr. Duncan said Andersen personnel were "trying to gather all docs re transactions from around the world." 
"Do your notes indicate that the documents were gathered and preserved or simply gathered?" Colorado Democratic Rep. Diane DeGette asked, prompting laughter. Ms. Temple responded that she understood Mr. Duncan to mean gathered "in one place to have it available." 
In fact, that was the day that, according to Andersen's account, Mr. Duncan called an urgent meeting of the Enron team that led to widespread destruction of documents. Before declining to testify, he told committee investigators that he provided his team with copies of Andersen's document policy but didn't directly order document destruction, according to an account released by the panel. A follow-up memo from another Houston manager the next day advised "everyone to do what is necessary to adhere to the guidelines" and to work overtime if necessary to do so. 
Buried in the Andersen officials' written testimony -- but not read aloud at the hearing -- was an acknowledgment that "Enron-related documents were destroyed by others" outside Mr. Duncan's team. Mr. Leonard, the Andersen spokesman, confirmed that personnel outside Houston also disposed of Enron-related items -- mostly e-mails that the firm expect to recover -- but he declined to say which other offices were involved or if Chicago was one of them. 
It was only after Andersen received an SEC subpoena Nov. 8 that Ms. Temple sent Houston a memo advising all employees to preserve all Enron-related documents. 
Asked why she waited so long, Ms. Temple said it was company policy to send out such advisories whenever a subpoena was received. Otherwise, Ms. Temple and Mr. Andrews testified, account executives -- in this case, Mr. Duncan -- are expected to make reasonable judgments. "The responsibility for that rests with the engagement partner," Mr. Andrews said. 
"I never counseled any destruction or shredding of documents," Ms. Temple testified. "And I only wish that someone had raised the question so that we could have consulted and addressed the situation." 
Rep. Billy Tauzin, chairman of the full committee, urged Andersen to reconsider its policy of leaving such matters to auditors. "If all your policies are to let accountants decide when it is legal to destroy documents in a pending investigation, an awful lot of people are going to be in trouble down the road," he said. "If you don't change it, I promise you, we will."

October memo warned of 'heightened risk' of fraud 
Firm draws fire for delay before halt of shredding 
Compiled from staff and wire reports 
Jan. 25, 2002, 9:10AM
WASHINGTON (Houston Chronicle) -- Some officials at Arthur Andersen were worried about a "heightened risk" of fraud in Enron's books a week before the energy company shocked stockholders with huge losses, an auditor's memo from last October shows. 
The e-mail by Andersen auditor Mark Zajac warned that a computer analysis of Enron's financial activities in the third quarter of last year indicated "a red alert: a heightened risk of financial statement fraud," according to investigators. 
The document, released by Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., added to mounting evidence that Enron's outside accounting firm had strong misgivings about Enron business practices. 
"We have considerable rascality," Dingell, ranking Democrat on the House Commerce Committee, summed up today on CBS's The Early Show. "We have to find out who is at fault for what." 
But a House hearing Thursday into the Enron Corp. collapse left lawmakers still certain of only one thing: Thousands of documents were destroyed by Enron's blue-ribbon accounting firm. 
Questions about who ordered the shredding, and whether it was intended to stifle government investigations, were left unresolved after a Commerce subcommittee concluded its first public hearing into the largest and perhaps most devastating bankruptcy in history. 
A week after the "red alert" memo, Enron reported a $638 million third-quarter loss and disclosed a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity, partly because of hidden debt built up by a complex web of partnerships. 
On the same day that Zajac wrote his memo to the head of the Enron auditing team, Andersen also hired a law firm in anticipation of possible lawsuits involving Enron, the Houston-based energy giant that spiraled into bankruptcy Dec. 2. 
Andersen played down the significance of the computer analysis. And Zajac in the memo acknowledged the system produces "false alarms." 
Lawmakers on Thursday ferociously criticized Arthur Andersen for waiting weeks after a federal investigation was under way before halting in-house destruction of Enron documents. Andersen executives in turn tried to blame fired auditor David Duncan for sole responsibility in the shredding -- a claim met with skepticism by House inquisitors. 
Duncan, denied immunity by the House Energy and Commerce Committee, appeared briefly before the subcommittee on oversight and investigations, where he twice invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. 
"Mr. Duncan, Enron robbed the bank, Arthur Andersen provided the getaway car, and they say you were at the wheel," said Rep. Jim Greenwood, R-Pa., after Duncan took his seat at the witness table. 
A tense-looking Duncan, flanked by his lawyers, informed the committee he wouldn't be answering any questions. 
"I would like to answer the committee's questions, but on the advice of my counsel I respectfully decline to answer the question based on the protection afforded me under the Constitution of the United States," Duncan said. 
The exchange kicked off a new round of congressional hearings into the collapse of Enron and the involvement of its former auditors at Andersen. 
On the other side of Capitol Hill, the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee was hearing from former SEC officials and academic experts on whether Enron's troubles should have been spotted earlier and how to strengthen current safeguards. 
The two panels are among at least nine looking into various aspects of what lawmakers are calling the Enron debacle. 
The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Labor Department also are investigating, and the Justice Department has opened a criminal probe. 
At the House subcommittee hearing, lawmakers repeatedly grilled Andersen attorney Nancy Temple about why she waited until Nov. 10 to instruct employees to start saving Enron documents. 
As early as Oct. 9, Andersen had hired an outside law firm in anticipation of possible litigation in the Enron matter, lawmakers said. 
Enron's highly public financial free fall began Oct. 15, when the company reported more than $600 million in quarterly losses and a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity. 
Enron also had disclosed as early as Oct. 22 that the SEC was probing its books. 
Gesturing dramatically and thumping his desk in the hearing room, Rep. W. J. "Billy" Tauzin, R-La., chair of the committee, asked Temple why she was silent for so long about the need to preserve documents. 
"I never counseled any shredding or destruction of documents. I only wish someone had raised the question," Temple said. 
Tauzin fired back, "Does anybody have to raise it, or is it somebody's responsibility in the company to raise it themselves? Whose responsibility is it but yours?" 
Andersen fired Duncan last week, saying he had organized a massive destruction of Enron documents beginning Oct. 23. 
C.E. Andrews, an Andersen global managing partner who also appeared before the committee, said it was Duncan's responsibility to protect the documents. 
"I cannot say it more strongly, Mr. Duncan was not following company policy. Mr. Duncan was violating company policy," Andrews said. 
The claim, echoed by other Andersen witnesses, drew fresh scorn from Tauzin, who questioned why such a sensitive legal issue was left to an accountant. 
"I hope you're all OK, I don't know," Tauzin warned, referring to the legal ramifications the testimony raised. "I don't know what's going to come out of all this." 
Several lawmakers said they suspect Andersen is making a scapegoat of Duncan, when it appears many employees may have been involved in destroying Enron documents. 
In an internal, Oct. 24 Andersen document the committee released Thursday, a manager instructs staff to use overtime if necessary in complying with the company's policy, which at the time called for destruction of all but the final auditing documents. 
Noting that retaining documents is largely a passive act, Greenwood asked why complying with the Andersen policy would require staff to use overtime. 
"If the emphasis is on retaining documents, it doesn't seem to us that a whole lot of overtime is required," Greenwood said. 
Tauzin added that investigators believe documents may have been destroyed by Andersen in both the Houston and Chicago offices. 
Andersen, which is rewriting its policy on document retention, called a halt to the destruction of Enron materials on Nov. 10, the day after the SEC subpoenaed the auditing firm. 
"My mother would say your policy was dumb like a fox," Greenwood told the Andersen executives. 
Dorsey Baskin, managing director for Andersen, said the firm took decisive steps to remedy the issues surrounding the document shredding. 
"We certainly are not proud of the document destruction, but we are proud of our decision to step forward and accept responsibility," Baskin told the committee. 
Although the committee had originally subpoenaed Andersen CEO Joseph Berardino, they accepted Baskin as a substitute to answer questions about companywide policy and the firm's response to the Enron crisis. 
Subpoenas also were issued to Temple and Andersen manager Michael Odom, which investigators said would give them legal cover in the event of future litigation involving Enron. 
Odom, an Andersen employee since 1969, was moved out of management duties in Houston the day Duncan was fired. Odom told lawmakers Andersen officials didn't specify why he, Odom, was being disciplined. 
"I asked what the reason was and I was told the firm felt it had to make some bold moves to restore confidence in the Houston community," Odom said. 
Rep. Gene Green, D-Houston, a member of the committee, told lawmakers that Enron's collapse had devastated the city. 
Hearing the stories of former employees, "literally, the tears would come to your eyes," Green said. "Clearly the insiders knew what was going on." 
Lawmakers in the coming weeks will be expanding the probe of document destruction, and also looking at the financial and other problems that brought about Enron's historic collapse. 
Several said that changes in the law or federal regulations may result from various issues illuminated through testimony. 
It was unclear whether any of the four who testified Thursday would return for more questioning when hearings resume in the House committee next month. 
Duncan's request for immunity from prosecution is not likely to be granted by the committee, since it could later impair the Justice Department's ongoing criminal probe. 
Duncan, who also was subpoenaed by the committee, began cooperating with House investigators the day after he was fired from Andersen. Since then, his immunity request has cast a chill on his relationship with investigators. 
Greenwood complained that Duncan's ongoing silence could impede the committee's work -- including unraveling the mysteries surrounding the fired auditor. 
"I still haven't made up my mind on whether Mr. Duncan was a rogue employee or whether Mr. Duncan was set up as a scapegoat," Greenwood said.

Enron Hid Losses, Ex-Worker Says Energy: Manager warned executives $500-million deficit was attributed to another unit to create illusion of profit.

A former Enron Corp. manager warned top company brass in August that more than $500 million in losses from the firm's energy services unit were being hidden in another division so the unit could misleadingly report profit to Wall Street, a copy of her e-mail reveals. 
The allegations by former employee Margaret Ceconi were made in an Aug. 29 e-mail to Chairman Kenneth L. Lay, who Wednesday resigned from the empire he built.
Ceconi's e-mail apparently wasn't connected to another whistle-blower memo sent by Vice President Sherron S. Watkins to Lay in mid-August. 
Although Watkins warned that losses hidden in off-balance-sheet partnerships could cause Enron to "implode in a wave of accounting scandals," Ceconi's concerns focused on the juggling of losses within Enron units. A copy of her e-mail was obtained by The Times. 
According to Ceconi, whose allegations were reported Thursday in the Houston Chronicle, losses of more than $500 million were transferred from Enron Energy Services to Enron Wholesale Services--the firm's lucrative trading unit--in a financial sleight of hand to deceive investors and analysts. 
Until last spring, the energy services unit was co-headed by Thomas E. White Jr., who now is Army Secretary. He could not be reached for comment Thursday. 
"EES has knowingly misrepresented EES' earnings," Ceconi wrote. "This is common knowledge among all the EES employees, and is actually joked about. But it should be taken seriously." 
Ceconi wrote the e-mail--a rambling memo in which she lashes out at Enron management--after she was fired from EES. She complains in the memo that she was "fraudulently" recruited with misleading information about EES and then unfairly let go. 
Enron spokesman Mark Palmer could not be reached Thursday. In the Chronicle he characterized Ceconi as a "disgruntled" employee, but would not comment on the specifics of her memo. 
Ceconi could not be reached for comment. But her attorney, Demetrios Anaipakos, said her concerns about the accounting practices outweighed her personal beefs with Enron. "She felt that EES was being portrayed as a money-making operation when it was exactly the opposite," he said. 
EES provided energy services to commercial and industrial firms, promising them predictable long-term energy supplies and improved energy efficiency. Enron touted the unit as having huge growth potential. 
According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Enron revamped the EES unit last year, moving some commodity "risk-management activities" to the Wholesale unit. 
As part of the restructuring, Enron restated its second-quarter 2000 results for EES. Originally, the unit had revenue of $840 million and operating income of $24 million. After the restatement, revenue was cut in half to $420 million, but profit almost doubled to $46 million. 
The restructuring could have been "an attempt to move a money-losing operation into a segment that was more profitable," said Randy Beatty, dean of the accounting school at USC, who reviewed the SEC document for The Times. 
Some analysts said Enron repeatedly restructured operations to boost the financial results of individual units. "They kept restructuring the business segments so they could shift earnings from one section to another," said Prudential Securities analyst Carol Coale. 
Accounting experts said companies can freely restructure their operations, thus altering the reporting of profits and losses. But, said William Kinney, an accounting professor at the University of Texas in Austin, such reorganizations should be done for valid business purposes, not just to "move things around." 
"It's subject to abuse if you're trying to hide bad performance," Kinney said. But proving intent is difficult, he said. 
Anaipakos said Ceconi, who left a senior job at GE Capital to join Enron in late 2000, received a call from someone in human resources after she sent the e-mail. "She was told her allegations were being taken seriously, [but] I can say she never heard from them again," he said. 
Ceconi, now employed by a Houston consulting firm, also contacted the SEC by phone twice in August and September to voice her concerns, Anaipakos said. 
"Some would say the house of cards [is] falling," Ceconi wrote in the e-mail to Lay, which also complained of favoritism and discrimination at the company. 
"You have to decide the moral or ethical things to do, to right the wrongs of your various management teams. I wish you luck."

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: SELLING ENERGY
Ex-Workers Say Unit's Earnings Were 'Illusory'
By ALEX BERENSON

01/25/2002
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 5
c. 2002 New York Times Company

A major division of the Enron Corporation overstated its profits by hundreds of millions of dollars over the last three years, and senior Enron executives were warned almost a year ago that the division's profits were illusory, according to several former employees. 
The division, Enron Energy Services, competed with utilities to sell electricity and natural gas to commercial and industrial customers. It was run by Lou L. Pai, who sold $353 million in Enron stock over the last three years, more than any other Enron executive, and Thomas E. White, who left Enron to become secretary of the Army last June.
Energy Services accounted for a small part of Enron's revenue but was promoted by the company as a big growth opportunity. Unlike the complex partnerships and other entities that Enron used to move debt and losses on outside investments off its books, this unit was a real business with more than 1,000 employees and customers like J. C. Penney. 
But former employees, including three who were willing to be identified, suggest that Energy Services used shoddy accounting practices to create ''illusory earnings,'' in the words of Jeff Gray, who joined Enron in 2000 and worked at the division for most of 2001. 
For example, by estimating that the price of electricity would fall in the future, Enron could book an immediate profit on a contract. 
The employees' allegations raise fresh questions about Mr. White's role at Enron, where he was an executive for 11 years. In a disclosure last May, just before he became Army secretary, Mr. White reported that he owned more than $25 million of Enron stock and would be paid $1 million in severance from Enron. 
Because he went from the Army to Enron and back to the Army, Public Citizen and others have voiced concerns about potential conflicts. While he was at Energy Services, it sold a $25 million contract to the Army. As secretary, he said that he would move energy services at bases to private companies, like Enron. 
A spokesman for Mr. White did not return repeated calls for comment. Mr. Pai, the former chairman, and a spokesman for Enron also did not return calls. Peggy Mahoney, a spokeswoman for Energy Services, said the division's financial results had accurately reflected its business. ''It was no pie in the sky,'' she said. 
Enron created Energy Services in 1997 to take advantage of the deregulation of electricity markets nationally. It promised to cut its clients' energy costs by installing energy-saving equipment and finding cheaper natural gas and electricity. 
Energy Services operated as essentially a freestanding company, but its results were included in Enron's financial statements, which were audited by Arthur Andersen. Energy Services organized itself so that it could use a financial reporting technique called mark-to-market accounting, which Mr. Gray and other former employees said the division had abused to inflate its profits. 
Under traditional accounting, companies book profits only as they deliver the services they have promised to customers. But Energy Services calculated its profit very differently. As soon as it signed a contract, it estimated what its profits would be over the entire term, based on assumptions about future energy prices, energy use and even the speed at which different states would deregulate their electric markets. 
Then Energy Services would immediately pay its sales representatives cash bonuses on those projections and report the results to investors as profits. By making its assumptions more optimistic, the division could report higher profits. 
As a result, the sales representatives and senior managers pressed the managers who made the central assumptions about deregulation and energy prices, said Glenn Dickson, a manager at Energy Services who was fired in December. 
''The whole culture was much more sales driven than anything else,'' Mr. Dickson said. ''The people that were having to sign off on the deals with a gun to their head knew that it wasn't a good deal.'' 
Mr. Dickson and other former employees said senior executives at Energy Services knew that their assumptions were unreliable. At the same time, expenses ballooned as Energy Services found that the costs of managing its contracts were higher than it had projected. 
''They knew how to get a product out there, but they didn't know how to run a business,'' said Tony Dorazio, a former product development manager at Energy Services. 
In 1999 and 2000, under the leadership of Mr. Pai and Mr. White, Energy Services would sign almost any deal, a former employee said. But by the end of 2000, the executives were no longer paying much attention to daily operations, Mr. Dickson said. 
None of the former employees said they knew whether Mr. Pai or Mr. White were aware of any accounting lapses at Energy Services. With Energy Services hemorrhaging cash in 2000, even as it began to report profits to investors, the unit began reviewing some of the contacts to determine whether it had overstated its profits. But publicly, Enron continued to promote Energy Services' prospects. A year ago, Jeffrey K. Skilling, Enron's president at the time, told Wall Street that the division was worth about $20 billion. 
''They said at one point they expected it to be as large as wholesale,'' said Jeff Dietert, an analyst at Simmons & Company in Houston. Enron's wholesale trading division, which bought and sold electricity and natural gas worldwide, was the source of most of its profits. 
The division generated $165 million in operating profit on $4.6 billion in sales in 2000, in contrast to a loss of $68 million on sales of $1.8 billion in 1999, according to Enron's 2000 annual report. 
Even as Enron promoted the division's potential, it accelerated its review of the contracts and brought in new management. By February 2001, Enron had transferred Mr. Pai out of the division and named David Delaney, who came from the wholesale business, as its top executive. A former brigadier general, Mr. White remained until he became secretary of the Army. 
A former employee said that in February or March 2001, senior managers within Energy Services spoke to Richard A. Causey, Enron's chief accounting officer, to discuss potential losses associated with a handful of large contracts. The potential losses on those deals topped $200 million, the employee said. 
About the same time, Mr. Delaney discussed the potential losses with Mr. Skilling and other top corporate executives, this employee said. 
Sales slowed last year as Mr. Delaney forced the division to use more conservative and accurate projections when deciding on a contract, Mr. Dickson said. The move frustrated some sales representatives, but stemmed losses, he said. 
Although Energy Services publicly reported profits until Enron collapsed, it continued to lose money last year because of the unprofitable contracts, employees said. 
Margaret Ceconi, a former sales manager, sent a letter in August to Kenneth L. Lay, then Enron's chairman, saying that Enron had hidden losses on its contracts by putting them in the wholesale division. 
''It will add up to over $500 million that E.E.S. is losing and trying to hide in wholesale,'' Ms. Ceconi wrote in her letter, which was previously reported in The Houston Chronicle. 
Today, Energy Services is essentially a shell. After filing for bankruptcy Dec. 2, Enron walked away from many contracts, an action allowed under bankruptcy rules. 
Energy Services' decision to exit so many contracts, including its largest, a $2.2 billion contract signed only last year with Owens-Illinois, the giant glass and plastic maker, is proof of the problems at the division, former employees said. 
''They kept telling me, and I heard it many a time, that it was a sound business plan,'' Mr. Dorazio said. ''After being in this business for 21 years, it didn't seem sound to me.''

Chart: ''Many Variables, One Profit'' Enron Energy Services sold contracts to provide natural gas and electricity to companies for long periods. The companies found the prices attractive. But when it had the chance in bankruptcy court, Enron walked away from many of the contracts, a tacit acknowledgement that they were not profitable. A HYPOTHETICAL 10-YEAR ENERGY CONTRACT 1. Enron would agree to provide electricity and natural gas at a fixed price for 10 years. 2. It then used a computer model to project the cost and profit of providing this service. Among the many variables that Enron considered were the prices of power in states that were deregulating, the expected dates when states would deregulate power supplies and the expected demand, based in part on the installation of energy-saving devices at the company. Such factors are very hard to project. ENRON'S ACCOUNTING: 10 YEARS IN ONE 3. Even though most of Enron's contracts were unprofitable at first, and would only become profitable later if its projections proved accurate, Enron could book those profits as soon as it signed them under mark-to-market accounting.(pg.

Andersen Officials Grilled on Shredding; Fired Enron Auditor Declines to Testify

House members probing the sudden demise of Enron Corp. pressed executives at the company's auditor, Arthur Andersen, yesterday on why they didn't do more to preserve Enron audit documents last fall, after they learned that federal regulators were investigating the energy trader's finances. 
Lawmakers cited an e-mail showing that an Andersen official in October had urged auditors on the Enron account in Houston to work "overtime" to follow the company's rules on document retention and destruction. The e-mail did not specifically say to retain documents. One committee member said he interpreted the memo as a veiled suggestion to destroy documents.
Another Andersen document said a computer analysis of Enron financial activity showed that the company warranted a "red alert" of possible fraud. It was dated Oct. 9, a week before Enron announced a large loss. 
Andersen officials played down the significance of the fraud warning, saying later that the software was unreliable. 
The Andersen witnesses staunchly defended the firm's actions, saying they sent out a detailed reminder to preserve documents as soon as the big accounting firm received a subpoena in November. They blamed the shredding on David B. Duncan, the lead Enron auditor, who was fired last week. 
Duncan, citing the advice of his attorney, declined three times to answer questions in a brief appearance before the committee. He invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege against self incrimination. 
"Mr. Duncan, Enron robbed the bank," said Rep. James C. Greenwood (R-Pa.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee's subcommittee on oversight and investigations. "Arthur Andersen provided the getaway car. And they say you were at the wheel." 
Greenwood questioned after the hearing whether Duncan was "a villain or a scapegoat." 
C.E. Andrews, a global managing partner at Andersen, tried to deflect responsibility from others at the accounting firm. "Destruction of documents during that period was wrong, and we admitted that," he said. "I cannot say more strongly Mr. Duncan was not following company policy." 
Andrews acknowledged that others at Andersen also destroyed Enron-related documents, although he said the volume and circumstances were different. 
Andrews said the document policy was later suspended because it was not clear enough. It was dropped Jan. 10 when Andersen first announced that some of its employees had destroyed Enron-related documents. 
As House lawmakers sought to determine exactly what Andersen knew about the shredding -- and when the firm knew it -- Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan made pointed statements about the potential impact of Enron's accounting practices in an appearance before the Senate Budget Committee. 
A visibly passionate Greenspan said that if "everybody did what is alleged in the Enron accounting system, our [economic] system could not work" because investors have to be able to rely on the information they receive. He referred to Enron's use of off-balance-sheet partnerships to conceal a large amount of corporate debt as "an egregious act." 
While saying that he is not worried that Enron's collapse will hinder investment in U.S. companies or cause interest rates to rise, he said the case "is going to create a really major rethinking in a lot of people about whether there is a spin game going on with respect to information coming out of business into the investment community." 
An Enron hearing before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee also took a broader view of the issues raised by the nation's largest bankruptcy. Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.), chairman of the committee, said his panel's examination will include questions about whether industry regulators and agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission tracked Enron's activity closely enough. "And if not, why not?" Lieberman added. 
One Senate witness, former SEC chairman Arthur Levitt Jr., chided an array of people, including analysts, rating agencies and government regulators, for failing to do enough to prevent the Enron debacle. 
"Enron's collapse did not occur in a vacuum," Levitt said, adding that it was partly a result of a "culture of gamesmanship" among go-go businesses that believe "it's okay to bend the rules." 
Yesterday's hearings were part of nearly a dozen congressional investigations into Enron's collapse and allegations that it misled investors and, along with Andersen, tried to hide questionable business practices. 
The Justice Department is investigating Andersen's document destruction as part of its criminal probe of Enron's collapse. In Houston yesterday, FBI agents were inside Enron's headquarters investigating the shredding of documents there, which was disclosed earlier this week. 
In remarks after the four-hour House hearing, Rep. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said more people than previously disclosed knew about document destruction by Andersen, "perhaps in Chicago," at the company's headquarters. 
Greenwood scoffed at the idea of Andersen employees working overtime to uphold the document-retention policy. "It doesn't seem to us it takes a lot of overtime to retain documents," he said. 
The testy House session demonstrated the complexity, disagreement and posturing that are quickly coming to characterize the widening investigations of Enron's fall. 
Lawmakers from both parties have pledged to examine how the energy trader collapsed, the allegations of corporate fraud and coverups, and the impact on thousands of investors who lost billions of dollars when Enron's share price dropped to less than a dollar in recent months. 
Greenwood opened the House subcommittee hearing by calling it "just the first step in a thorough and rigorous investigation." He and other panel members were aggressive in their questioning -- and openly skeptical of the responses of Andersen executives. 
A focus of much of the questioning was the role of Nancy Temple, an Andersen lawyer who wrote an Oct. 12 memo that she said was meant to remind Duncan and others about the company's policy, which calls for the retention of some documents and the destruction of others. Temple told lawmakers her memo was not intended as a directive to shred documents. 
The 35-page policy statement said that under normal circumstances, employees were to retain only final work papers supporting client audits, and to throw out drafts, but that if litigation was anticipated, all documents were to be retained. In her testimony, Temple said she meant employees to understand that they were to retain documents. 
"Your memo was interpreted, as you know, as a shredding order," said Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.). Duncan's attorneys say he interpreted it to mean he should destory Enron-related documents. 
Temple's testimony also revealed that she contacted Andersen's outside legal advisers, Davis Polk & Wardwell, before sending an Oct. 16 e-mail to Duncan asking that he delete her name and other references to legal advice from a memo he had written about potentially misleading statements in an Enron news release about its earnings. 
She said the outside lawyers recommended she do that so that if Andersen was sued or investigated over its Enron auditing, discussions between Duncan, Temple and other lawyers would be protected by attorney-client privilege. 
Andrews said Davis Polk had been retained by Arthur Andersen on Oct. 9 because of "potential litigation" stemming from Enron's troublesome financial statements. 
Tauzin and other lawmakers yesterday questioned why Andersen's general counsel or compliance officer didn't issue clear instructions that day about preserving documents. 
Temple said she e-mailed an explicit directive to preserve Enron audit documents on Nov. 10, in response to a subpoena the company had received two days earlier from the SEC. Temple said she called Duncan directly the day before to underscore the message. After that call, Duncan's assistant sent out an e-mail to other secretaries in the Houston office saying "no more shredding." 
Among the questions Duncan would not answer yesterday was why, if he thought the Oct. 12 memo was a directive to destroy documents, he waited 11 days to accelerate the process. 
Temple also told lawmakers about a Sept. 28 telephone conversation among Andersen partners to discuss Enron and the possibility of problems and errors in the company's past financial statements. She said one partner brought up the idea of deleting a sentence acknowledging that the firm had given incorrect accounting advice. She testified that she told the partners they shouldn't do that. 
Tauzin said he is troubled that an accounting partner at Andersen would even suggest such a thing, and that Temple didn't seem surprised by it, even though "she did the right thing" by forbidding it. 
Tauzin said "the clear picture we're getting at this hearing is that somebody felt it was a good idea to get rid of an awful lot of documents . . . and it's not a pretty one."

Judge OKs depositions on shredding 
Order for 6 includes fired Andersen auditor 
By ROSANNA RUIZ 
Copyright 2002 Houston Chronicle 
Jan. 24, 2002, 8:59PM
A federal judge has approved an order allowing attorneys for Enron stockholders to take depositions from one former and five current employees of the company's auditing firm concerning document destruction. 
This settles a dispute raised by defense attorneys who asked to delay the process, mainly because their clients are facing inquiries from so many investigations. 
U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon's order, issued late Wednesday, states that depositions may begin after Arthur Andersen completes its internal report about the shredding of Enron-related documents. The report is due within three weeks. 
"We're glad we persisted. We're glad we prevailed," said Bill Lerach, a San Diego attorney representing Amalgamated Bank. "We look forward to taking the testimony under oath of the officials at Andersen who destroyed documents." 
The New York-based bank is one of several plaintiffs suing Andersen and 29 former and current Enron executives and board members. The suit alleges the insiders were aware of accounting problems that led to Enron's inflated earnings and higher stock prices. 
Rusty Hardin, attorney for the accounting firm, opposed allowing depositions of David Duncan, the lead auditor fired by Andersen last week; four Andersen employees on administrative leave, and Andersen's in-house attorney, Nancy Temple. Hardin argued that the depositions might interfere with investigations by Congress, the departments of Labor and Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
The four Andersen employees placed on administrative leave -- Thomas H. Bauer, Michael Lowther, Michael Odom and Stephen Goddard Jr. -- must also answer plaintiffs attorneys' questions about the shredding or deletion of Enron documents. 
"We hoped those depositions would be put off because those people are being pulled in so many directions. But we don't have any problems with the order," Hardin said. 
Duncan, identified by Andersen as the organizer of the unauthorized destruction of Enron documents when the SEC began its investigation, invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege Thursday before the House Energy and Commerce Committee. He may do the same when he is deposed. 
Temple, based in Chicago, will be deposed about an ambiguous Oct. 12 e-mail she wrote regarding the company's document-retention policy. 
During her appearance before the House panel Thursday, Temple denied that the e-mail advised Andersen employees to destroy any documents. 
Hardin said he could not predict whether Duncan or the others would provide answers during the depositions. That decision, he said, rests with them and their attorneys. 
"I thought the plaintiffs would have a better chance of getting detailed information if they waited a while, but they didn't want to," Hardin said. 
Lerach argued this week that the depositions ought to be taken now while memories are fresh. 
Harmon's order states that each deposition will last up to eight hours and cover only the "document and data retention, storage, removal, deletion and attempts to restore or recover deleted or destroyed materials. No documents need be produced in connection with these depositions." 
The six may also be deposed at a later date about the document destruction. 
Andersen must allow experts hired by the plaintiffs' attorneys an opportunity to evaluate the company's efforts to recover or reconstruct Enron-related documents that were destroyed or deleted. 
The plaintiffs' attorneys will also be given access to Andersen's document-storage facilities to ensure appropriate security measures are in place.

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE CHAIRMAN
An Optimist Sees the Chaos Become Surreal Spectacle
By JIM YARDLEY

The New York Times
Page 7, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

HOUSTON, Jan. 24 -- In the last days before his resignation, Kenneth L. Lay was up there on the 50th floor, above the city that once lionized him, a fallen king barricaded atop his silver tower. Mr. Lay, a friend said, had hired a security guard to protect himself against death threats. Employees gossiped that he arrived by private car in the loading dock and was whisked to his office on a freight elevator, all to avoid attention. 
He must have struggled to recognize the new, chaotic world below. His company, Enron, had collapsed. His days, according to another friend, were filled with lawyers. His pal, the president of the United States, who had once referred to him affectionately as Kenny Boy, complained that his mother-in-law had taken a bath on Enron stock.
The Rev. Al Sharpton showed up calling for justice. The Rev. Jesse Jackson, who in November shared a private prayer with Mr. Lay, returned this evening in the midst of the crisis. That Mr. Lay merited the ministrations of Mr. Jackson, who is known to gravitate toward catastrophe, was only one indication of the surreal spectacle that his precipitous fall had become. 
''I do not think he's ever had a failure,'' said Bonnie Bourne, his older sister, who lives in Columbia, Mo. ''My father was eternally optimistic. I see that in Ken: things are going to work out. And it has." 
Until now. By stepping down Wednesday evening, Mr. Lay ends his tenure as Enron's chairman and chief executive and begins his new career -- that of a defendant in lawsuits, a witness before Congressional committees and a potential target of criminal investigations. The questions now facing Mr. Lay about Enron's partnerships and accounting practices represent the ultimate Washington endgame: what did he know, when did he know it and did he betray the trust of his employees and shareholders? 
Mr. Lay, 59, gathered top Enron executives and employees in a conference room on Wednesday to deliver the news that he was leaving the company, just as he had earlier told Enron's board via a conference call. He had been asked to resign by the court-appointed creditors committee, but he had floated the idea himself as far back as November when the company was negotiating its failed merger with its energy rival, Dynegy. 
''When the Dynegy deal was taking place,'' said Thomas A. Roberts, a lawyer for Enron in New York who is serving as a liaison to the creditor's committee, ''he at that point thought if his presence as an officer of the company was going to cause a problem, he would consider resigning.'' 
Mr. Lay had been thinking about resigning, on his own terms, even before Enron's troubles emerged. 
In August, when his hand-picked successor, Jeffrey K. Skilling, unexpectedly resigned as chief executive, Mr. Lay, then only the chairman, had told friends and family that he was easing toward retirement. But Mr. Skilling's abrupt departure, coupled with the steady decline in the company's stock price, prompted Mr. Lay to reassume the chief executive position. 
''He came home for a family reunion in August,'' Ms. Bourne said. ''Skilling had just resigned. I said, 'I thought you were ready to get a boat and take to the sea.' And he said, 'Well, not yet.' " 
Mr. Lay called a meeting of employees on Aug. 16, two days after Mr. Skilling's departure, and was greeted with a standing ovation. For many Enron employees, the unpretentious, folksy Mr. Lay represented the moral ballast of a company that they felt had spiraled out of control. He was a former chairman of the local United Way; a branch of the Y.M.C.A. was named after him. 
Even today, some workers who have lost their jobs refuse to blame Mr. Lay. 
''He had an almost cultish following,'' said one Enron executive who was among the more than 4,000 workers laid off on Dec. 3, the day after the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. 
But Mr. Lay could not work miracles, and a string of recent disclosures have raised questions. He said in August that questions about the partnerships used to inflate profits were ''way over my head,'' yet that same month he met with a vice president who detailed her concerns. 
At the same time that Mr. Lay was learning about these potential problems, he was encouraging employees to buy more Enron stock and reassuring them that the company would rebound. He continued to sell shares himself in September and October, a decision his lawyer has attributed not to a lack of confidence in his company but to pressure to pay off millions of dollars in loans. 
Either way, Mr. Lay's legacy is more than tarnished for many employees. Fired employees have printed T-shirts that read ''Layd Off,'' and howled after the company paid $55 million in retention bonuses while giving a $4,500 severance to those who were let go. The retirement funds of many employees have been wiped out. 
''It's clear to people with Enron that the paternal figure he represented -- that died a long time ago,'' said the executive who was among those laid off. ''He should have left last year.'' 
Those who have spent time with Mr. Lay say he has expressed frustration but not anger. Mr. Jackson said that when he met with Mr. Lay in November: ''When I did talk with him, and did have prayer with him, he seemed to be dazed by all these revelations. He seemed unaware of what all had happened.'' 
Robert Mosbacher, the former secretary of commerce who served on Enron's board during the 1980's, said he spoke briefly with Mr. Lay before Christmas. ''It was sort of a little telephone hug to say, 'I'm sorry,' '' said Mr. Mosbacher, who initiated the call. ''He didn't sound great, but I don't think you or I would be any better.'' 
Others checked in, too. Mr. Lay's friend and fund-raiser, Sue Walden, said she spoke with him on Tuesday about his frustrations with the press coverage of Enron's collapse. He felt it was one-sided, she said, and ''he seemed very upset that any of his political ties and his friendship with the president could be used to hurt the president.'' 
But few people talked with Mr. Lay as much as Mr. Roberts, the Enron lawyer who is liaison to the creditor's committee. He said they often talked five times a day. 
He said Mr. Lay was usually upbeat and surprisingly optimistic, mentioning that he and his wife ''pray over this regularly.'' On Wednesday, Mr. Roberts listened to the conference call as Mr. Lay told the board of his resignation. He said Mr. Lay then broke the news to top executives and staff members. 
Later, after the news was out publicly, Mr. Roberts said he called one final time, at 10:30 p.m. Eastern time. Mr. Lay, he said, told him, ''This has not been a good day.'' 
He is certain to face more of them.

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE OVERVIEW
Enron Hearings Open, Focusing on Destroyed Papers
By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. and STEPHEN LABATON

WASHINGTON, Jan. 24 -- Lawmakers investigating the Enron Corporation said today that new evidence showed that the company's auditors, Arthur Andersen, destroyed documents knowing that they might be relevant to criminal and civil investigations. 
At a hearing this morning before a House subcommittee examining the collapse of Enron, lawmakers heard evidence that two weeks before Andersen executives in Houston began destroying documents the accounting firm retained a law firm to prepare to defend itself in cases that could arise from Enron's problems.
A document released by lawmakers also shows that on the same day the law firm was hired, Oct. 9, some Andersen officials were worried that there was a ''heightened risk of financial statement fraud'' with Enron's books. 
In addition, the subcommittee released copies of an e-mail message received by Andersen employees a day after government regulators announced their investigation of Enron. Lawmakers said employees construed the message as a directive to begin destroying records. 
David B. Duncan, an Andersen partner until he was fired after acknowledging that he took part in destruction of records, declined to respond to questions from House lawmakers, invoking his Fifth Amendment right against forced self-incrimination. [Excerpts from Congressional hearings, Pages C8-9.] 
The hearings brought together many elements of American political and economic life: the partisan battle over the proper role of government regulation, the bursting of the financial bubble of the 1990's and the quarrel over the influence of money in politics. 
And the sessions were yet another indication of the mounting impact on Washington of Enron's collapse, the largest corporate bankruptcy in history. Even as the White House spokesman, Ari Fleischer, argued that the company's collapse was a corporate scandal, not a political one, its political effects were visible in Congress and at the White House. 
Controversy over large political contributions from Enron helped House members fighting to overhaul the nation's campaign finance laws to move their legislation closer to a floor vote, with Mr. Fleischer saying a Bush veto was unlikely. All the attention focused on the millions donated by Enron to members of the two parties has intensified the pressure on Mr. Bush and other political leaders to back change. 
There were other signs of how Enron's fortunes had intersected with politics. Associates of Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's top political adviser, said he had recommended a lucrative consulting contract with Enron for Ralph Reed, the Republican strategist, as Mr. Bush was weighing whether to run for president. The associates said the arrangement helped keep Mr. Reed's allegiance to the Bush campaign without putting him on any payroll. 
A new computer analysis of campaign finance records showed that of the 248 senators and House members on the 11 Congressional committees that are investigating the Enron affair, 212 had received contributions from Enron or Arthur Andersen. The donations from the two companies have been so pervasive that all the Senate's top 20 recipients of Enron donations are serving on at least one panel investigating Enron. Because many lawmakers who accepted Enron donations were Democrats, the burgeoning scandal has created bipartisan discomfort. 
Among those testifying today was Arthur Levitt, the former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, who had tried with limited success to impose tough conflict-of-interest restraints on the accounting industry. 
''Too many elements of the system are not trustworthy today,'' Mr. Levitt told the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee. ''They have failed us because of self-dealing and self-interest.'' 
The House and Senate committees conducting today's hearings include members who had beaten back earlier proposals for tougher conflict-of-interest rules for auditors and who had supported legislation in the 1990's that made it harder for investors to sue unethical accountants and easier for corporations to put out misleading financial projections. 
Mr. Levitt proposed a number of changes to eliminate the possible conflicts of interests of Wall Street analysts and accountants and make corporate boards more independent-minded. He also suggested the adoption of a new rule that required companies to change auditors every five to seven years ''to ensure that fresh and skeptical eyes are always looking at the numbers.'' 
He also suggested that the recent proposals by his successor at the agency, Harvey L. Pitt, were weak. Mr. Pitt, whose proposals have come under heavy criticism since they were announced last week, has proposed that a group dominated by outside experts should discipline the accounting industry. 
Some lawmakers, including members who had received donations from Enron and the accounting industry, said the collapse demonstrated the need for changing campaign finance laws. 
''Because Enron has made substantial political contributions to members of Congress and the executive branch, some will question the independence in launching such an investigation,'' said Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, the Connecticut Democrat who heads the Governmental Affairs Committee. ''There are two things we in Congress can do to overcome that skepticism and rebuild public trust: conduct completely independent investigations of Enron and pass campaign finance reform.'' 
The committee's ranking Republican, Senator Fred Thompson of Tennessee, agreed. 
''We have an opportunity to do some good here on a bipartisan basis,'' Mr. Thompson said as he outlined issues raised by the scandal. ''In the process, we may even finally decide that allowing huge amounts of soft money contributions to public officials is not such a good idea.'''' 
In the House hearing, Representative Billy Tauzin, the Louisiana Republican who heads the the Energy and Commerce Committee, which will hold a hearing on Feb. 6 focusing on Enron, said ''scores and scores'' of Andersen employees were engaged in document destruction. 
''It's clear to us that our investigation, and other investigations, have been impeded by this policy,'' he said. 
The ranking Democrat on the committee, Representative John D. Dingell of Michigan, said Andersen's actions were ''either criminally stupid, or stupidly criminal or both.'' 
Lawmakers said it appeared plain that senior Andersen officials were aware by early October, when the firm hired the law firm of Davis Polk & Wardwell, that lawsuits were possible, yet they did nothing to ensure that crucial documents were preserved, waiting until receiving a subpoena on Nov. 8 to instruct employees to ''stop the shredding.'' 
This was a major mistake, lawmakers said, and it contradicted recent comments by Andersen's chief executive, Joseph F. Berardino, who said Sunday on ''Meet the Press'' on NBC that Andersen's policy was ''not to shred documents, not to eliminate documents if you have a reasonable basis to anticipate an investigation.'' 
This morning, the first witness, Mr. Duncan, strode to the hearing table flanked by his two lawyers, Robert Giuffra and Vince DiBlasi. Wearing a dark blue suit, Mr. Duncan, 42, rose and was sworn under oath, but he invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, and he was dismissed by the subcommittee chairman, Representative James C. Greenwood, Republican of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Greenwood said he was frustrated by Mr. Duncan's refusal to testify and told him: ''Enron robbed the bank. Arthur Andersen provided the getaway car, and they say you were at the wheel.'' But speaking with reporters later, Mr. Greenwood said he remained concerned that ''Mr. Duncan and others were the fall guys'' for a firm that sanctioned document destruction when they knew litigation was likely. 
Andersen officials at the hearing said Mr. Duncan orchestrated the shredding without direction from superiors, and a firm spokesman, Patrick Dorton, played down the timing of the hiring of the outside law firm. ''It would not be unusual for this firm or any company to seek the advice of outside counsel in a situation like this,'' Mr. Dorton said. 
An Andersen spokesman dismissed the document that discussed the risk of ''financial statement fraud,'' saying it stemmed from an experimental computer model Andersen was using that often registered false results. 
In a statement after the hearing, Andersen said that it had ''deep regret for the disturbing actions of several of its employees on the Enron engagement'' but that the testimony ''further demonstrates the firm's complete resolve to learn the facts, make them known to the government and the public, and take every appropriate action against the individuals involved.'' 
Four Andersen officials testified today, but the committee saved its sharpest questioning for Nancy Temple, a lawyer in the firm's Chicago office who by early October was working closely with Andersen partners in Houston who were reviewing what they viewed as Enron's increasingly troubled accounting. 
On Oct. 12, Ms. Temple had sent to auditors in Houston a copy of e-mail showing the firm's document-retention policy, which some lawmakers said amounted to a green light to destroy documents. Mr. Duncan and other Andersen officials interviewed by the committee's investigators have called her e-mail unusual. 
Lawmakers also were critical that notes she took during an Oct. 23 conference call with Mr. Duncan and other partners involved with the Enron account did not indicate that preserving documents was mentioned. Her notes read, in part: ''AA trying to gather all docs re transaction from around the world.'' 
''And those notes don't say anything about preservation, do they?'' Representative Diana DeGette, Democrat of Colorado, asked. 
Ms. Temple also drew the ire of the subcommittee when she characterized as ''positive'' an October report by Enron's outside law firm, Vinson & Elkins, on Enron's accounting. 
Mr. Tauzin told her: ''We're trying to get the facts here. But if you will characterize a report that indicates a decline in the value of Enron's stock and a serious risk of adverse publicity and litigation as a positive report from the attorneys, we are going to have trouble with your testimony today.''

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE IMPACT
Bipartisan Outrage but Few Mea Culpas in Capital
By DON VAN NATTA Jr.

01/25/2002
The New York Times
Page 5, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

WASHINGTON, Jan. 25 -- The Enron scandal has grown so large that it took not one but two hearings on Capitol Hill today for the politicians to begin sorting through the mess, while also carefully sidestepping their own role in it. 
Anyone who tried to watch or listen to both proceedings simultaneously heard a bipartisan chorus of outrage about shredded documents and empty retirement accounts.
''Enron robbed the bank. Arthur Andersen provided the getaway car, and they say you were at the wheel,'' Representative James C. Greenwood of Pennsylvania, the Republican chairman of the House Energy Committee's subcommittee, told David B. Duncan, the dismissed Arthur Andersen partner who led the accounting firm's audit of Enron and who invoked his Fifth Amendment right today against self-incrimination. 
Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, said: ''When the corporate insiders at Enron realized the ship was sinking, they grabbed the lifeboats and left the women and children, their workers and investors, to drown.'' 
While politicians were quick to blame Enron's accountants for allowing the giant energy trading company to collapse, few on either panel were prepared today to accept any blame for the role Congress played. 
The White House, meanwhile, once again insisted today that the company's failure was a business scandal -- not a political one. 
White House officials adopted the stance of outraged victim and vengeful cop. ''Nothing is going to stop the president and this administration from pursuing justice,'' said Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman. 
Vice President Dick Cheney continues to refuse to release a list of people who met with his energy task force last year, even though more senators have called for its release. Mary Matalin, a counselor to Mr. Cheney, said today that the administration felt the list should be withheld to protect the participants' privacy. 
On Capitol Hill, some of the members posing the toughest questions today had in earlier years voted for legislation that deregulated commodities markets. They also blocked several attempts to toughen accounting standards. Those decisions helped make it easier for Enron to escape the scrutiny of government regulators. 
Several senators sitting on the Governmental Affairs Committee, like Senator Robert G. Torricelli, Democrat of New Jersey, pressured the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2000 to abandon a proposed rule that would have barred accounting firms from performing auditing and consulting work for the same client, as Andersen did for Enron. He was one of 13 senators who intervened to quash the plan. 
Yet Mr. Torricelli offered one of the day's only mea culpas. Addressing Arthur Levitt Jr., the former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission who had pushed for the rule and testified today, Mr. Torricelli said: ''We were wrong. You were right.'' 
Both at the White House and in Congress, the message is simple: Punish those responsible for the Enron debacle, and do everything possible to make sure another Enron does not happen. There is not much appetite on either end of Pennsylvania Avenue for the news media or the public to dwell on any role the legislative or executive branches may have played in creating an environment to allow Enron to flourish. 
''After all of the sound and fury of these investigations, the bottom line questions are: Is Congress willing to amend the law to rein in the greed of the next Enron?'' Mr. Durbin asked. ''Are we willing to concede that the genius of capitalism can result in ruthless behavior without our oversight and the protection of law?'' 
Just as the White House has tried to avoid any political fallout from the Enron debacle, members of Congress have tried to escape any collateral damage from the scandal. So the House Energy Committee resembled a bipartisan corporate tribunal. Members acted as both prosecutors and judges and the accused, Arthur Andersen L.L.P., was left with almost no defense. 
But many of the 11 House and Senate investigations into the scandal plan not only on looking back, as was today's chore, but also on trying to draft legislation that will prevent another Enron. Whether that includes the campaign financing laws that have helped give the public the impression that many legislators have been tainted by contributions from Enron or the accounting firms remains to be seen. 
''They are going to hit the easy targets first and hit the easiest bad guys first,'' said Larry Noble of the Center for Responsive Politics. ''But they are going to have to deal with the tougher questions, too, about their own role in this.'' 
Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, one Democrat who has come under scrutiny for his role in accounting legislation, has vowed his committee will recommend changes in the law and regulations. 
The inquiries are reminiscent of the role played by Congress during the savings and loan crisis of the 1980's. Some lawmakers touched by the scandal, most notably Senator John McCain of Arizona -- who took contributions from Charles Keating, the operator of a failed thrift, and spoke on his behalf -- were deeply affected by that experience and made campaign finance overhaul a signature issue. Mr. McCain said of the Enron scandal, ''It's clear there is a taint out there on all of us.'' 
As Mr. McCain's campaign finance bill regains momentum on Capitol Hill, it is unclear whether the Enron debacle will have a similar effect on House members and senators who once sided with Enron and the accounting industry. 
One candidate is Representative Billy Tauzin, the Republican chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. On July 20, 2000, in a letter co-signed by 20 House members, Mr. Tauzin opposed any toughening of accounting rules. In the previous five years, Mr. Tauzin had received nearly $150,000 from accounting firms. 
As chairman of Congress's most aggressive committee investigating Enron, Mr. Tauzin has hammered away at the accounting profession. 
His spokesman, Ken Johnson, said the case had changed Mr. Tauzin's view of auditor independence. Two years ago, Mr. Tauzin was convinced Mr. Levitt's plan was ''a solution to a problem that didn't exist,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''Now we know there's a problem. It's time to fix it.''

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE PARTNERSHIPS
Investors Lured To Enron Deals By Inside Data
By KURT EICHENWALD

01/25/2002
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 4
c. 2002 New York Times Company

Enron executives enticed wealthy individuals and institutions to invest in one of the partnerships that helped wreck the company by dangling the prospect that inside knowledge could potentially help them double their money in a matter of months, according to partnership records and prospective investors. 
In dozens of pages, the confidential records of a partnership called LJM2 describe the inner workings of an entity at the heart of the Enron debacle. The records show company executives wearing two hats, offering banks, insurance companies, Wall Street firms and wealthy investors inside knowledge about Enron and its off-the-books holdings -- information that they denied company shareholders.
The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating whether Enron's accounting for its partnerships violated the law, though details of its inquiry have not been disclosed. 
Under pressure from the S.E.C. investigation, Enron began disclosing details of its partnerships last fall and started down what turned out to be the road to collapse. 
The records show that Enron disclosed to potential investors the conflicts of interest posed by Enron executives' playing a dual role, but sought to allay concern over them. 
The LJM2 partnership was run by Andrew S. Fastow, who at the same time was Enron's chief financial officer. It was set up, in part, to invest in entities that Enron controlled and to purchase investments that Enron did not want on its books. 
Mr. Fastow and other Enron executives who managed the partnership had a duty to maximize returns for Enron shareholders, the documents note, even as they were offering a separate set of lucrative deals to banks, Wall Street firms and wealthy individuals who owned stakes in the partnerships. 
According to the documents, the spectacular returns were possible because the partnerships would be investing in deals originated by Enron, then in its heyday as a swashbuckling global pioneer of energy deregulation. The investments would draw on confidential, nonpublic information developed by the energy company, the documents explained. 
''Enron frequently has access to investment opportunities that are not available to other investors,'' the private placement memorandum for LJM2 said. 
Securities experts say that knowledge of the investment plans and strategies of hot companies, like Enron was at the time, is a coveted commodity on Wall Street because it can provide investors a leg up. 
The records show that investors in LJM2, which set out to raise $200 million and ultimately took in $349 million, were given more information about Enron's financial situation than the company's shareholders. 
For example, documents sent to potential investors in 2000 revealed that Enron controlled about 50 percent more assets than disclosed in Enron's securities filings. The difference -- $34 billion versus $51 billion, as of June 30, 1999 -- was the value of assets moved off Enron's books through various partnership deals. 
The disclosures created conflicts for Wall Street firms, as well. For example, the investment banking arm of Merrill Lynch & Company, which underwrote the LJM2 offering, was aware of the off-balance-sheet figures for Enron; indeed, Merrill's name is on the cover page of the offering containing the data. 
But because the numbers were confidential, that information could not be shared with Merrill brokerage clients who were investing in Enron stock. Joe Cohen, a Merrill spokesman, declined to comment. 
Merrill was not alone. Dozens of other banks, brokerage firms, pension funds and other institutional investors were approached to invest in LJM2 just over two years ago, and all were provided with the confidential data about the extent of Enron's off-balance-sheet dealings. 
Enron's shareholders learned little of these deals until the company restated its financial results last fall, erasing nearly $600 million in profits over five years, and provided additional, but still fragmentary, details. 
Wall Street firms are supposed to maintain a so-called Chinese wall to ensure that customers of their brokerage operations are not made privy to inside information gleaned by their investment bankers. In this case, securities experts said, the intent of those laws was undermined. 
The transactions ''followed the legal norms to produce a perverse result,'' said John C. Coffee Jr., a securities law expert at Columbia University. ''It's a case where the Chinese wall is working to injure public investors, rather than benefit them.'' 
At the same time, analysts of the Enron stock were provided little information about the partnerships. 
John Olson, an analyst with Sanders Morris Harris in Houston who was long a skeptic on Enron stock, recalled that he once questioned company executives about their partnerships. 
''They told us, 'We can't discuss it, it's confidential, and we are enjoined from disclosing anything about it,' '' Mr. Olson said. 
Among the investors in LJM2, according to court records, are Citicorp, the American Home Assurance Company, the Travelers Insurance Company, and an investment partnership affiliated with Morgan Stanley. 
The partnership documents made clear to potential investors the magnitude of the conflicts of interest created by the dual roles of the executives. ''One of the most challenging due diligence issues for the partnership is the potential for conflict as a result of the principals' dual positions as Enron employees and principals of the partnership,'' the offering memorandum said. 
A separate document disclosed last week by Congressional investigators said that Enron's board waived the company's code of ethics to allow Mr. Fastow to serve as LJM2's general partner. Investors were told that Richard A. Causey, who is still Enron's chief accounting officer, was assigned responsibility for monitoring the partnership and mediating conflicts of interest. 
The partnership documents -- including sales presentations made by Mr. Fastow to potential institutional investors in LJM2 -- describe in detail the workings and performance of several partnerships that have gotten the most attention since the Enron scandal began to unfold. 
Among them are limited partnerships known as JEDI I and JEDI II, an acronym with a ''Star Wars'' glint that stood for Joint Energy Development Investments. 
The records said that investors in those partnerships initially were promised returns of 15 percent and 20 percent, respectively. By the time LJM2 was being marketed, JEDI I had returned 23 percent annually for its life, and JEDI II -- which was still in operation -- was expected to return 194 percent annually. 
For the LJM2 partnership, according to internal records and marketing materials, the Enron executives were expecting a minimum annualized return of 30 percent. But sales agents also emphasized the earlier partnerships' results. 
''The implication of their pitch was very clear,'' said one person who heard it. ''At least 30 percent could mean well over 100 percent or more.'' 
As of last March 31, according to confidential partnership records, three of the four largest investments in LJM2 brought in returns of more than 100 percent. The lowest return, from an investment in another Enron entity called Raptor I, was 58 percent over four months; the highest, in Raptor II, was 212 percent in just over three months. 
In the first quarter of last year, the partnership distributed $75 million to investors -- or about 44 percent of the total of $171 million that was invested in the partnership by the end of 2000.

ENRON'S COLLAPSE
How LJM2 Tripped Up Enron
By Dylan Loeb McClain

c. 2002 New York Times Company

When Enron restated its earnings last year, reducing its profits from 1997-2001 by almost $600 million and shrinking its shareholder equity by more than $1.2 billion, it said that the reason was partly its deals with a partnership named LJM2. According to Enron, the partnership was independent of the company, but the top executives of LJM2 were also top executives at Enron -- a connection highlighted in the partnership offering papers as one reason LJM2 would be a desirable investment. Here is one way that the partnership became a problem. Dylan Loeb McClain

Chart SENIOR EXECUTIVES INCLUDED Andrew S. Fastow Chief financial officer Michael J. Kooper Managing director Enron Global Equity Markets Group Ben Glisan Jr. Vice president Enron Global Equity Markets Group LJM2 FORMED: Oct.1999 OUTSIDE INVESTORS Included Citicorp, American Home Assurance Company, American International Group, Travelers Insurance, Morgan Stanley GENERAL PARTNERS Mr. Fastow, Mr. Kooper, Mr. Glisan Raptor Subsidiary partnerships created to invest in Enron holdings. 1. Enron lent $1.2 billion of its stock to the Raptor partnerships. Enron also promised to issue more stock if the value of the Raptor investments fell, thus ensuring the solvency of the partnerships. 2. LJM2 invested millions of dollars in the Raptor partnerships. 3. Raptor invested in some of Enron's assets, like power plants and gas pipelines. It also bought some of the stocks that Enron had invested in, particularly New Power Holdings, a company Enron had spun off. What went wrong 4. The interests of LJM2 and Enron were at odds. At one point, in September 2000, LJM2 entered into an agreement that obligated it to buy Enron stock at a fixed price anytime Enron wanted to sell over the next six months. This was a way for Enron to protect itself against a decline in its stock price. But LJM2 asked to settle the contract early when it could pay less for the stock than its current price, thereby making $10 million. 5. Selling some of its stockholdings and assets to the Raptor partnerships insulated Enron against a decline in their value. But, when the value of those assets declined precipitously, Enron was obligated to provide more of its own stock to keep the partnerships solvent. Worse, as its own stock declined, it became necessary to issue more and more stock, further diluting the value of the stock held by its shareholders.

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: MUTUAL FUNDS
Many May Be Surprised To Be Enron Investors
By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

01/25/2002
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 3
c. 2002 New York Times Company

In the last year, more than 50 mutual funds and insurance companies, including some of the largest and best known in America, invested in a trust created by Enron in 1997 to finance the operations of several of the energy company's shadowy partnerships. As a result, many individual investors -- through these funds -- unwittingly owned a piece of an entity that was used to finance some of the partnerships that contributed to Enron's failure. 
In September 2000 the trust, called the Osprey Trust, raised $2.4 billion from institutional investors in a so-called private placement of notes due in January 2003. Within the last year, mutual fund and financial services companies like Putnam Investments, the Vanguard Group, Travelers and Prudential have bought Osprey debt.
By last fall, when Enron's troubles started to surface, prices on the Osprey debt began to drop. Since they were ultimately backed by Enron shares, the securities appear to have lost 60 percent of their value for any fund or investor still holding them. 
Osprey seems to have been a central fund-raising entity for several of Enron's partnerships, including LJM and Whitewing L.P., a partnership created by Enron that invested in energy-related projects in Europe and South America, including an electric distribution company in Brazil. Whitewing allowed Enron to realize cash from the partnership's investments, while keeping the partnership's debt obligations -- including the $2.4 billion it raised from large investors -- off Enron's balance sheet. 
Enron had included Whitewing in its consolidated financial statements in 1998 but removed it in March 1999, arguing that since it was owned jointly by Enron and Osprey it no longer belonged in Enron's reports. But when Enron's fortunes started to decline last autumn, it became clear that Enron's shareholders were ultimately responsible for the debt raised by Osprey. In a conference call with analysts and investors on Nov. 14, Jeffrey McMahon, who had only recently been appointed Enron's chief financial officer, disclosed that Osprey's assets, which had carried a book value of $4.7 billion, had declined in value by $600 million. 
Mr. McMahon also disclosed for the first time that the Osprey debt was backed by 50 million shares of Enron common stock and that the company had an additional obligation to issue more shares if the assets held in Osprey and the common shares were insufficient to repay the debtholders in 2003. 
Robert McCullough, a consultant to the electric utility industry at McCullough Research in Portland, Ore., calculated that the value of Osprey today is roughly 60 percent lower than its $4.7 billion book value stated last fall. His calculation takes into account the $600 million write-down disclosed by Mr. McMahon last November as well as the fact that the Enron stock backing the assets is now practically worthless. 
''That means exposing the Osprey owners to a large discount from book value as well,'' Mr. McCullough said. 
But it is not clear whether those left holding Osprey notes have written their values down appropriately. In documents dated as recently as this month, Mr. McCullough found several funds still valuing their Osprey holdings at levels that do not appear to reflect the diminished value of those positions. 
Owning a piece of Osprey may come as a surprise to some holders of bond mutual funds. Investors who buy bond funds are typically more conservative than those who buy stock funds. Bond investors usually seek income and preservation of their capital; some buy funds which limit their holdings to securities issued by the United States government or high-grade corporations, while others take on more risk by purchasing lower-grade bonds that carry higher yields. 
Private placements, like the one Osprey used to raise money from investors, are offered only to large institutional investors with more than $100 million under management. As such, they are initially exempt from registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Although Osprey's securities should have become registered automatically with the commission six months after they were offered, no Osprey filings could be found in the course of several searches of S.E.C. documents. 
Among the largest buyers of the debt was the AXP Bond Fund, an American Express Financial Advisers fund, which held $10 million worth in 2001. Several Prudential funds were big holders of Osprey; the Prudential Series Fund held more than $17 million of the debt. The Putnam Income Fund held $6.6 million in Osprey. To be sure, such holdings are minuscule when compared with the assets under management at these funds. 
The Osprey notes carried high yields even before Enron began its decline. One investor who owned the debt last year said that the holdings yielded around 13 percent before trouble struck. As Enron's fortunes sank last fall, but before the company filed for bankruptcy, the notes' yields climbed to 24 percent. 
Alan Papier, an analyst at Morningstar in Chicago, said that private placement debt, like the Osprey notes, are common holdings in mutual funds, especially those seeking high levels of income. ''These securities might have a little bit higher yield because by design there cannot be as wide an audience for them,'' he said. 
Delaware Investments, a money management concern in Philadelphia with $84 billion under management, bought and sold a small amount of Osprey debt several times the last 18 months. The firm, a subsidiary of the Lincoln Financial Group, owned roughly $6 million of Osprey notes in several of its mutual funds, which had assets totaling $2.4 billion. 
Matt Stephens, an analyst at Delaware, explained that he bought the Osprey notes because they were backed by assets owned by Enron but which the company had decided were not a part of its core business and had moved into the Osprey trust. That trust, Mr. Stephens explained, was set up to operate the assets and liquidate them over time. 
''We looked at it as a secured way to play the Enron credit story, and we used it as a trading vehicle,'' he said. Mr. Stephens added that the Osprey notes carried a higher yield than Enron's corporate debt and that made the investment attractive as well. 
Delaware lost money on its Osprey holdings, but not nearly as much as it would have if it had held on through Enron's bankruptcy filing. During the course of the last 18 months, the firm bought Osprey notes at $950 to $1,000 (or face value). It sold them at roughly $835 in November, after Enron executives had a conference call with investors and analysts outlining some of the company's problems. Mr. Stephens said the conference call created doubts at his firm about Enron's credibility. ''When we lose faith in management, it is a clear sell signal to us,'' he said. 
Other Osprey investors declined to comment on whether they still held the debt or whether they had written down its value in their funds. Spokeswomen for Prudential, Vanguard and Putnam all said their firms' policies were not to comment on individual holdings.

ENRON'S COLLAPSE
Ruling Accelerates Key Depositions

HOUSTON, Jan. 24 -- A federal judge overseeing lawsuits against Enron and its executives lifted certain trial rules today, allowing lawyers to interrogate quickly some partners from the company's accounting firm, Arthur Andersen, about the destruction of documents. 
Under the order, handed down by Judge Melinda Harmon of the Federal District Court in Houston, the lawyers could schedule depositions in as little as three weeks from David B. Duncan, who was the lead partner in charge of the Enron account, as well as four other partners and an in-house lawyer. Andersen fired Mr. Duncan on Jan. 15.
Mr. Duncan could invoke his Fifth Amendment right to decline to testify in a civil trial, as he did before a Congressional panel, but civil lawyers said they could use such a decision to insinuate that he had something to hide. 
''It can be a very powerful weapon,'' said Joseph A. McDermott, a lawyer representing Staro Asset Management, an investment firm in the Midwest that holds Enron bonds. A lawyer for Mr. Duncan, Robert Giuffra, said he had not received the judge's order and declined to comment.

Why Bush Stiffed Enron
By Virginia Postrel

Enron Corp. gave the Bush campaign lots of money. When Enron got in trouble, cabinet secretaries took its calls. But they did nothing to save it. 
What are we to make of this peculiar chain of events? What, after all, is the point of handing out corporate money to politicians if the company can't get favors when its life is on the line? Was there a secret bailout deal that hasn't made the papers? Or were administration officials just doing what was good for the country?
It would be nice to conclude that the Bush administration turned down Enron's entreaties because of its deeply held free-market principles. But the most likely explanation is more complex and cynical. In any Republican administration, there are three forces (sometimes organized in factions, sometimes operating within the same individuals) determining economic policy: pro-business instincts, pro-market principles, and political considerations. Get two of the three on one side, and chances are that side will win. 
Enron's problem, then, was exactly what Bush opponents tend to think of as its greatest strength. It was a Houston-based oil company. Enron, in other words, represented just the sort of voters President Bush can take for granted. In a reelection campaign, there's no way he would lose Texas. Indeed, many observers believe he lost the 2000 popular vote because he didn't work hard enough to get a large turnout in his home state. 
So Enron had no electoral clout, giving the Bush administration no political reason to sacrifice its economic principles to help save the company. By helping Enron, the administration could only lose, angering free market supporters and embroiling itself in a business mess. A bankrupt Enron couldn't even promise future campaign funds. If only Enron had been based in Pennsylvania or West Virginia. Then things would have been different. 
Just ask the steel industry. There, the Bush administration has pursued a dangerously protectionist policy, jettisoning not only its own stated principles but American leadership in breaking down barriers to free trade. 
To help ailing steel companies, the administration initiated what is known as a section 201 action. This allows the government to establish import quotas or tariffs for five years, limiting competition while the domestic industry tries to get its act together. Under this law, the protected industry doesn't have to show that foreign producers get any unfair advantages from their own governments or even that imports are the main source of its problems. The industry merely has to demonstrate that it's hurt by foreign competition. Since any competition makes business tougher, that's an easy case for a struggling industry to make. 
So the free-trade president has adopted a blatantly protectionist position, raising prices for everyone who buys or makes anything that uses steel. Big Steel is now demanding 40% tariffs and a bailout of $12 billion to cover lavish retirement benefits, particularly health costs. Steel retirees, who are, of course, already covered by Medicare, outnumber steel employees about 5 to 1. 
Why is the administration that wouldn't try to save Enron entertaining such pro-business, anti-market ideas? It's a simple political calculation. President Bush won steel-producing West Virginia (and, arguably, the presidency) by a mere 40,000 votes. He lost steel-producing Pennsylvania by only 200,000 votes. He doesn't have to worry about carrying Texas. He does have to worry about the swing states of the steel belt. 
That sort of calculation is nothing new in American politics. The first President Bush also denied the oil industry federal help while extending steel quotas. 
Nor is the split a purely Republican phenomenon. Back in the early 1970s, economic historian Gavin Wright took a careful statistical look at New Deal largess. He found that the Roosevelt administration directed money not at the poorest states, which were in the solidly Democratic South, but at the swing states of the West. After controlling for how rural states were, Mr. Wright found that 80% of the variation in spending could be explained by factors that defined political swing states. 
In a democracy of concentrated interests, some votes clearly count more than others. But, to look at the bright side, at least sometimes predictable votes lead to principled policies. The Bush administration dodged a bigger Enron scandal because it could take Texas for granted.

Trading Charges: Lawsuit Spotlights J.P. Morgan's Ties To the Enron Debacle --- Insurers Balk at Paying Bank Up to $1 Billion in Claims On Complex Transactions --- Update in a Glass Room
By Jathon Sapsford and Anita Raghavan

When J.P. Morgan & Co. set up an energy-trading business in the British Channel Islands a decade ago, the tiny venture barely caused a ripple at the giant bank. 
The operation, called Mahonia Ltd., consisted of just a small office with lots of phone lines. But the Jersey-based business grew over the years to transact billions of dollars of natural-gas contracts with other energy companies. Mahonia's trading followed a simple pattern: Many of its transactions took place just before year-end. Often, the deliveries of natural gas and oil were sold right back to those who delivered them through complex derivative transactions. And about 60% of Mahonia's trades were with just one company: Enron Corp.
The point of the choreographed trading? People familiar with Mahonia say Enron used the transactions to manage tax liabilities by transferring losses in one financial reporting period to another. As Enron's troubles mounted, the Houston company eventually turned to Mahonia as a sort of surrogate bank, these people say, using it to raise at least $2 billion in financing over the years. 
For J.P. Morgan, the arrangement was lucrative -- at least at first. The bank received as much as $100 million in revenues. It also thought it had insurance in place to cover any default by Enron. 
But in the wake of Enron's collapse and bankruptcy-court filing, Mahonia could cost the nation's second-largest bank as much as $1 billion. Several insurers have alleged in a lawsuit in New York federal court that the trading transactions were shams, thereby negating the insurance contracts. The bank, now known as J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., disputes the court allegation. Credit-rating concern Standard & Poor's cited J.P. Morgan's overall exposure to Enron as one reason it is reviewing the bank's credit rating for a possible downgrade. J.P. Morgan, which acted as a lender, underwriter and merger adviser to Enron, says the energy concern owes it a total of $2.6 billion. 
The Mahonia arrangement -- which J.P. Morgan hadn't disclosed to investors until last month's suit -- represents just a sliver of the many complicated ventures Enron participated in. But unlike the hundreds of partnerships Enron constructed on its own to keep debt off its books, this venture was conceived, launched and operated by J.P. Morgan. Though many Wall Street firms helped finance Enron -- acting as traditional lenders, underwriters and advisers -- the fact that J.P. Morgan set up the partnership suggests that Wall Street may have played a more active role in the Enron scandal. 
J.P. Morgan won't comment on some key aspects of the dispute, citing pending litigation. A spokesman says that "many companies routinely raise funds using pre-paid commodity forward contracts. The benefits vary from client to client, including pricing advantages and diversity of credit sources." 
Enron spokesman Mark Palmer says the trades were "perfectly legitimate and proper transactions" made as part of the normal course of trading commodities. 
Many things about the operation remain mysterious. It is unclear, for instance, who owns Mahonia. According to records from the Jersey Financial Services Commission, the company was incorporated on Dec. 16, 1992. It has two nominee shareholders, Lively Ltd. and Juris Ltd., who represent undisclosed owners. 
"The question is: Was Mahonia a conduit on behalf of Enron or a conduit on behalf of J.P. Morgan?" says Manfred Knoll, a managing director for Germany's Westdeutsche Landesbank, which issued a $165 million letter of credit to J.P. Morgan to guarantee against losses. He says Mahonia legally was a conduit of J.P. Morgan. But in practice, "it was a conduit that was set up to transact a variety of financial transactions for Enron." 
On Tuesday, a New York bankruptcy-court judge ruled that Enron will have to make available documents relating to Mahonia to the German bank, people familiar with the matter say. 
As part of its broad investigation into Enron, the Securities and Exchange Commission is reviewing J.P. Morgan's multifaceted relationship with Enron, people familiar with the matter say. Among other things, investigators are examining whether the bank, through vehicles such as Mahonia, helped Enron draw a misleading financial picture for investors. 
People close to the matter say Enron told J.P. Morgan the trades were for tax purposes. Tax experts say it is common for companies to manage tax liabilities by, for instance, deferring certain losses from a bad year, when the tax bill might be low, to a future period when they can be used to offset high earnings. There's nothing inherently illegal about trying to minimize corporate tax bills. Enron hasn't paid corporate income tax in four of the past five years, a spokesman says. 
The Mahonia maneuvers may draw additional scrutiny now, however, in light of admissions by Enron that it used a series of outside partnerships to hide losses. 
Whatever the ultimate goal, the transactions worked like this: J.P. Morgan would pay Enron between $150 million and $250 million for the future delivery of natural gas or crude oil. This was constructed as a "trade," not a loan. So Enron would report this as earnings that would cancel out, temporarily, losses on Enron books. 
But Enron had to eventually deliver the oil or gas, usually in regular installments with the value of $10 million to $20 million, the people familiar with Mahonia say. With each delivery, the losses began again to appear on Enron's ledger. These deliveries would begin the following year, so the losses were carried from one year to the next, without showing up clearly on Enron's books. 
The result: Enron kept those losses in reserve in case Enron had any profit windfall on which it might pay tax, the people familiar with the matter say. If it did, it would use those losses to cancel out profits, and thus lower its tax burden. Or if Enron didn't have big profits to hide, it would just roll the losses over again to the next fiscal year -- by going back to J.P. Morgan and selling it another gas contract. Two tax experts contacted for this article described the technique as unusual but potentially very effective. "It certainly makes sense as a tax strategy," says Doug Carmichael, a professor of accounting at New York's Baruch College. 
The whole process fed on itself. As one Wall Street banker put it, the arrangements "practically guaranteed" Enron would come back to J.P. Morgan for more. 
What was in it for Morgan? The deals generated, over the decade, fees and interest measuring as much as $100 million. In paying for future delivery of gas to Mahonia, J.P. Morgan got the gas at a discount -- reflecting the interest rate Enron would have paid were it getting a straightforward loan. In the summer of 1999, this amounted to somewhere between 7% and 8%, or roughly $7 million to $8 million for every $100 million J.P. Morgan channeled to Enron under the Mahonia arrangement. (That revenue, of course, was offset in part by the bank's funding costs.) The bank often got a small fee for arranging the financing. 
The arrangements were for years a source of pride within the bank's small commodities division, which directed the trades. Dinsa Mehta, one of J.P. Morgan's senior commodity traders, praised the deals to colleagues, saying that while Enron put out its other commodity financing needs for all of Wall Street to bid on, Enron kept coming back to J.P. Morgan for trades that would carry its losses forward. Mr. Mehta, contacted through a spokeswoman, declined to comment. 
In a basic way, the trading pact is a throwback. Prepaying for future delivery of a commodity is known as a "gold trade," because it is the way gold bullion has been trading for centuries. In recent years, trading companies, whether from Houston or Wall Street, have been making more use of this structure to buy and sell oil, natural gas and other commodities. Some commercial banks, including Chase Manhattan, a predecessor of J.P. Morgan, had to set up part of these trades overseas because their banking charters wouldn't allow them to take delivery of commodities. 
J.P. Morgan also bought commodities contracts from a number of other energy companies. Yet by far Mahonia's biggest customer was Enron, accounting for roughly 60% of its business, people familiar with the matter say. 
Over the years, the size of the transactions grew and the repayment periods stretched out further and further into the future. 
Mahonia's business with Enron jumped sharply in 1999. Oil prices were weak, causing concerns over the future profitability of the energy industry. The stock and bond capital markets had become reluctant to finance energy companies, leaving J.P. Morgan's offshore arrangements one of the few places this industry could raise money. 
In the summer of 1999, Enron officials contacted Morgan with requests to do bigger and bigger trades, including a large arrangement of $650 million in one trade. It was a far cry from earlier trades in the range of $150 million, and suggested to some people within the bank that Enron was no longer merely interested in tax avoidance, but was actively using the arrangement to meet its financing needs. 
J.P. Morgan officials couldn't do the business without hedges. The firm would be on the hook for a large chunk of cash if Enron defaulted before it delivered the natural gas. These arrangements, after all, presented the same default risk as any loan to Enron. J.P. Morgan effectively had been paying a portion of its earnings to other banks in exchange for their guaranteeing portions of the arrangement. This move shifted some of the risk to other banks like ABN Amro Holding NV or West LB. 
It wasn't enough. By this time, companies including Enron wanted to raise more through Mahonia than the banking syndicate was willing to handle amid the oil-price slump. So Enron, if it wanted more money, needed to find new players to share the risk of financing the gas payments. 
Enron turned to 11 insurance companies -- including National Fire Insurance Co., Safeco Insurance Co., St. Paul Fire & Marine Insurance Co. and Citigroup Inc.'s Travelers unit -- to issue "surety bonds." These are financial guarantees insurance companies commonly issue to ensure a project is completed, whether it's a bridge or Hollywood movie. Enron arranged these contracts for J.P. Morgan -- and paid the insurance companies for it -- so that the bank would feel more comfortable making increasingly large trades with the energy company, according to a person familiar with the arrangement. 
As Enron's trades grew bigger and bigger, the bank was also financing other energy companies, and the accounting on these trades became a source of concern within the bank. On Aug. 5, 1999, Vice Chairman Marc Shapiro and senior credit officer David Pflug convened a meeting in a glass room off the bank's commodity trading floor. 
As part of that briefing, the group went through a lengthy history of the bank's trading with energy companies. The managers were told one reason companies like Enron were entering the complex trades was to carry forward losses and lower tax burdens, a person familiar with the briefing said. This person said Mr. Shapiro reviewed the trades and said they were fine. Mr. Shapiro declines to comment. Mr. Pflug, confirming the meeting, said it was called to discuss another client and commodity derivative contracts in general. 
Two years later, the arrangement was still functioning as Enron's troubles deepened. Both Enron and J.P. Morgan kept looking for other institutions to share the risk as Enron kept running new trades through Mahonia. 
That's when Enron and Morgan turned to the German bank for more comfort. On Sept. 10, 2001, Enron and Morgan arranged to obtain a $165 million letter of credit from West LB to guarantee derivatives trades between Mahonia and Enron North America, according to Mr. Knoll, the bank managing director. 
In an unusual move underscoring Morgan's keen interest in the letter of credit, the legal documents were reviewed by Philip Levy, Morgan's associate general counsel. Mr. Levy didn't return a call seeking comment. 
Enron's woes deepened further. After a planned merger with rival Dynegy Inc. fell through, Enron filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Dec. 2. After the filing, Morgan requested to be paid under the letter of credit, Mr. Knoll says. So far, West LB has refused to pay, depositing the $165 million in an escrow account which it says it will make available when the Mahonia transactions underlying the lending facility are proved proper. 
It was only after the bankruptcy filing that investors first got a whiff of Mahonia. Morgan's insurers, due to make a payment on the surety bonds by a Dec. 21 deadline, refused to pay. Morgan sued in New York federal court. The insurers filed a counterclaim, alleging that Mahonia was a fabrication meant to disguise loans in the forms of commodity trades. 
In court papers, the insurers say they were led to believe the arrangements were meant to "actually supply natural gas and crude oil by Enron to Mahonia." But the insurers refuse to pay the guarantees because the arrangements "were not intended to be fulfilled," the insurers' complaint alleges. It adds that Mahonia was a "mechanism to obtain surety bonds to secure loans to be made to Enron in the guise" of trades. 
J.P. Morgan says the insurers' claims are without merit, noting that the surety contracts say the insurance liability is "absolute and unconditional." 
The case is pending. But the spat already has dented Morgan's credibility. Morgan Chief Executive Officer William Harrison called his board shortly after the Enron bankruptcy filing and told them the bank had some $500 million in unsecured exposure and some other secured exposures, including loans of $400 million backed by pipeline assets. 
But after the insurers refused to honor their commitments on the surety bonds, Mr. Harrison had to hit the phones again to directors, and raise the number to $2.6 billion -- with roughly $1 billion of the additional exposure directly related to Mahonia. 
Morgan has been defending its position ever since. Last week, the bank reported a fourth-quarter loss of $332 million, partly because of its exposure to Enron. 
Meanwhile, Mr. Shapiro, the vice chairman, asserts that Morgan has known all along the extent of its Enron vulnerability. "It's not an issue of what we knew," he said late last month "but what was appropriate to disclose."

Accounting for Enron: Former SEC Chief Levitt Reverses Stand, Calls for New Laws on Accounting Rules
By Michael Schroeder
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

WASHINGTON -- Former Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt, reversing an earlier stand, told Congress that the collapse of Enron Corp. uncovered systemic accounting problems that can be fixed only through legislation. 
"The environment today calls for very different remedies, very different action," Mr. Levitt told the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee. "If you would have asked me a year ago whether a legislative solution was desirable, I would have said `no.' "
With Enron, "the smoking gun has exploded," he said, adding. "That's often what it takes for a wake-up call." 
Congress needs to authorize a new, independent oversight board for the accounting industry, he said. He also told lawmakers that the SEC needs to adopt new accounting standards to better track the effect of executive stock options and to require full disclosure of off-balance-sheet "special purpose entities," which Enron formed to conceal losses. 
Mr. Levitt was joined by Lynn Turner, former SEC chief accountant, who called for an overhaul of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the industry's independent rule-making body, as well as an overhaul of accounting rules as well. 
"What is reflected here is a shared sense of outrage," said Committee Chairman Joseph Lieberman (D., Conn.). He said the committee would do a thorough investigation and hold more hearings, with "a shared desire to end this investigation with serious proposals for reform." 
In the aftermath of the Enron bankruptcy filing, Mr. Levitt has been upstaging his SEC successor, Harvey Pitt, in promoting needed reforms. He applauded Mr. Pitt's recently announced proposal for a new private-sector oversight board, but questioned whether it went far enough. Mr. Levitt proposed that Congress approve and fund a new board that is completely independent of the accounting industry. 
Messrs. Levitt and Turner said that FASB, which is responsible for creating accounting standards, fails to approve needed changes because they are blocked by board members appointed by the securities and accounting industries. 
For instance, the SEC first asked the FASB to improve the standards for reporting special purpose entities in 1985. The end result was a "weak set of rules," Mr. Turner said. Because of growing problems, the SEC called for new stiffer rules in its 2000 report to Congress. "We cannot afford to wait another 15 years," Mr. Turner said. "If the FASB were unable to resolve this by the end of 2002, then I would urge the SEC to act promptly." 
Also in testimony yesterday, University of San Diego law professor Frank Partnoy said he has independently gathered information that Enron manipulated its derivatives trading revenue. "In a nutshell, it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit and loss entries for the derivatives Enron traded," Mr. Partnoy said. 
Mr. Partnoy, who formerly worked as a derivatives salesman at J.P. Morgan, said Enron's extensive use of derivatives was a major cause of the company's financial downfall. Enron reported more than $16 billion in gains from derivatives over the three years to 2000. 
Vance Meyer, an Enron spokesman, said he hadn't seen the testimony and as a general rule Enron wouldn't offer a counterpoint to testimony from Washington hearings.

A Renewed Call to Redo Accounting Reform: Two years after initially urging changes in industry, a former SEC chairman has Senate panel listening closely.

WASHINGTON -- Two years ago, Arthur Levitt couldn't muster much support for a proposal to make accounting firms more independent by limiting their ability to sell consulting services to their audit clients. 
Amid strong opposition from the accounting industry, corporations and members of Congress, the then-chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission backed down.
On Thursday, however, the same proposal held the rapt attention of a roomful of fawning senators and caused Levitt to be mobbed by reporters after his testimony. 
"So do you feel completely--or just absolutely, totally--vindicated?" quipped Sen. Mark Dayton (D-Minn.). 
In another sign that government priorities have changed as a result of the Enron Corp. bankruptcy, the Senate on Thursday held its first full committee hearing to examine why the energy giant collapsed and what the government could have done to prevent the loss of billions of dollars by employees and investors. 
The hearing set the stage for what is certain to be a vigorous debate in the coming months over sweeping regulatory proposals to rein in financial markets, retirement funds, campaign fund-raising and the energy industry. 
Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.), who chairs the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, promised Thursday to lead an aggressive nonpartisan investigation into the Enron debacle, seeking answers from government agencies including the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the White House. 
"We will follow the facts wherever they lead us," Lieberman said. 
Among the questions Lieberman hopes to answer are: How did Enron hide its debts and losses from SEC oversight? Could the Labor Department have intervened to prevent Enron employees from losing their retirement savings? Are Wall Street analysts providing objective analysis of stocks? Did regulatory gaps allow Enron's problems to slip through the cracks? 
But Republicans warned against rushing to new regulations. Only a year ago, the Bush administration and the Republican Party were vowing to slash government rules in many of the same areas currently under a microscope. 
The blame for Enron's bankruptcy filing Dec. 2--less than a month after it restated earnings to account for $586 million in previously unreported losses--may ultimately rest with illegal activity of individuals, not a breakdown in regulation, said Sen. Fred Thompson (R-Tenn.), the ranking Republican on the committee. 
"No system known to man can prevent unscrupulous and clever individuals from manipulating the system and even getting away with it for a period of time," Thompson said. 
He also warned Democrats not to try to take political advantage of the investigation by focusing on "titillating" issues, such as the contacts between Enron officials and the Bush administration. 
Levitt called upon Congress to pass new laws to tighten regulation of financial markets, which he said have been eroded by a "culture of gamesmanship that says it's OK to bend the rules, tweak the numbers and let obvious and important discrepancies slide." 
In addition to renewing his call for limits on the types of consulting work accounting firms can perform for an audit client, Levitt said companies should be required to change audit firms every five to seven years; stock exchanges should require that a majority of directors on company boards be independent; and analysts should be forced to disclose how their compensation is affected by their firms' investment relationship with companies they cover. 
Levitt and Lynn E. Turner, the SEC's former chief accountant, said a new accounting oversight board is needed with independent members, reliable funding and a mandate to move quickly and aggressively to eliminate accounting loopholes and gimmicks. 
Turner said it has taken the Financial Accounting Standards Board longer to approve new rules for special-purpose entities--the kind of off-the-books partnerships used by Enron to mask its problems--than "it's taken my children to get through high school." 
Derivatives trading is another area ripe for government regulation, said University of San Diego law professor Frank Partnoy, who told the committee Thursday that Enron's heavy reliance on the high-risk market rivaled that of the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund, which failed in 1998. 
In fact, Partnoy said, Enron reported earning more money from trading derivatives in 2000 than Long-Term Capital Management made in its history. 
"Enron makes Long-Term Capital Management look like a lemonade stand," said Partnoy, a former derivatives trader who is writing a book about Enron's collapse. 
Derivatives, used by sophisticated investors as a risk-management tool, are complex financial instruments whose value is based upon a future variable, such as interest rates or gas prices. 
Though some derivative trading occurs on regulated exchanges, the vast majority--more than $95 trillion a year--take place on over-the-counter markets that were exempted from regulation in 2000 under the Commodity Futures Modernization Act. 
Enron used derivatives in two ways. First, they were key to structuring Enron's controversial partnerships, which allowed it to hide debt, mask investment losses and inflate earnings. Enron used them as a kind of financial "plastic surgery to make itself look better than it really was," Partnoy said. 
Second, they were key to Enron's profit. The company used its Enron Online division to act as a go-between for other parties wishing to trade not only energy-related derivatives, but also contracts for such commodities as fiber-optic bandwidth. By the time Enron filed for bankruptcy, the soaring revenue from the derivatives trading business was masking problems in Enron's core energy business. 
The lack of government oversight may have enabled Enron to smooth out profits from derivatives trading to make the business appear less volatile. He said that was accomplished by creating accounts that enabled Enron to carry over trading profits from year to year. 
An Enron spokesman could not be reached for comment on Partnoy's allegations.

A noted plaintiffs' law firm, which is taking a highly visible role in a shareholder suit against Enron Corp., is being investigated by federal authorities in connection with allegations that it improperly solicited investors to file class-action suits, people familiar with the probe said. 
The U.S. Attorney in Los Angeles has convened a grand jury to investigate Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach LLP, these people said. Officials are trying to determine whether the firm paid money to people to act as plaintiffs in lawsuits, the people familiar with the probe said.
Milberg Weiss, which has offices in New York and San Diego, didn't return phone calls seeking comment. The grand-jury investigation was reported yesterday by the Los Angeles Daily Journal, a legal-industry newspaper. 
Disclosure of the probe comes as Milberg Weiss is in a pitched battle with other plaintiffs' firms vying for the role of lead counsel in securities-fraud suits filed against Enron in federal court in Houston. The firm made headlines earlier this week marching into court with a box of shredded documents carted out of Enron headquarters by an ex-employee. 
Until recently, law firms that filed securities-fraud actions first often were given control of cases -- and the chance to make the largest fees. Firms such as Milberg Weiss often maintained a stable of clients to help launch the suits. The probe is looking at how Milberg Weiss identified those clients, and whether they were paid. 
Since 1995, larger, institutional investors have been taking a greater role in securities-fraud suits, because of a change in federal law. In the Enron case, Milberg Weiss is representing the Regents of the University of California. Lloyd Lee, a university lawyer, said the regents have consulted with Milberg Weiss, and "they assured us that they were cooperating fully with the inquiry." 
Separately, the federal judge in Houston presiding over the shareholder lawsuits related to Enron's collapse, ordered Arthur Andersen LLP to make six of its current and former officials available for depositions by next month and provide a detailed account of document shredding that took place in its Houston office. 
The order is unusual because it comes so early in the litigation. Typically, under federal securities laws, plaintiffs' attorneys must wait until all pending motions for dismissal have been resolved before they are allowed to proceed with the discovery phase of a case. 
"It is a very sensible order under these extraordinary circumstances," said Jeff Kaiser, an attorney at Kaiser & May LLP in Houston, one of the law firms representing shareholders in the Houston case. His firm also is pursuing a separate lawsuit against Andersen in a Galveston County, Texas, state district court. 
The order by U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon requires Andersen to submit a report within 20 days cataloging the documents it destroyed, describing any documents it has been able to recover and explaining the efforts it has made to do so. Additionally, Andersen's report must include a description of Enron-related materials currently in the firm's possession.

After Enron, a Push to Limit Accountants to...Accounting
By Deborah Solomon

When it was flying high, energy-trading company Enron Corp. was famous for pioneering new markets. Here is something else it is helping to develop: a relatively new breed of shareholder proposal. 
A number of institutional investors -- with Enron's rapid collapse in mind -- are calling for companies to adopt "conflict of interest policies" that would prevent their accounting firm from providing anything beyond auditing services. Shareholder proposals seeking to limit the accounting firms' roles have surfaced at a wide range of companies following Enron's meltdown. At the heart of such proposals: concerns that accounting firms have a financial incentive to sign off on overly aggressive accounting practices at companies that simultaneously pay them large sums for nonaudit work.
In Enron's case, the Houston company paid Arthur Andersen LLP $25 million for its audit and $27 million for nonauditing work, including tax-related and consulting services, in 2000, the last year for which figures are publicly available. In November, Enron restated its results for the previous four years, wiping out $586 million, or 20%, of its previously reported earnings. In recent testimony before Congress, Andersen officials have said they don't believe their independence as an auditor was compromised by the nonauditing fees. 
"It took Enron to get shareholders interested in addressing this issue, but many investors want auditor independence," says Patrick McGurn, vice president of Institutional Shareholder Services, a proxy adviser that makes recommendations for how institutions should vote. 
Shareholders are proposing these policies for about 30 companies, including Apple Computer Corp., Johnson & Johnson, Motorola Inc., PG&E Corp. and Walt Disney Co. Most of the companies are fighting the initiatives and have asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to rule that they don't have to put the proposals to a vote. Corporate-governance specialists expect the SEC to rule in favor of shareholders, putting the initiatives on the ballots for annual meetings later this year. 
Whether any of the proposals become policy at the individual companies is another matter; rarely do shareholder proposals pass. But some who track corporate-governance developments say support for these new ones could be strong enough to prompt companies to agree to limit the use of their auditing firms for other activities. "It can embarrass management," says John C. Coffee Jr., law professor at Columbia University. "The real success of these kinds of proposals is that they will lead to negotiations . . . that might put restrictions on the amount of consulting that these companies can do." 
The no-conflict-of-interest initiatives are being proposed by labor unions, which hold shares in companies as part of pension plans and other investments. The United Brotherhood of Carpenters, which controls $35 billion in pension assets, proposed the policy at several companies after reviewing the ratio of audit to nonaudit fees. The SEC began requiring that companies disclose that information as of the year 2000. 
Many of the companies were paying 10 to 15 times more for nonaudit-related services than for auditing fees. Ed Durkin, director of special programs for the United Brotherhood of Carpenters, says: "The impression somebody could get from looking at these numbers is that there might be issues of independence and of the integrity of the financial-reporting system." 
But some say a blanket policy restricting the accounting relationship isn't necessarily going to prevent an Enron-like blow-up. "It's probably more a matter of disclosure than limitations," says David Bowers, an analyst with Evergreen Investment Management Co., which owns shares of PG&E. While investors need to pay attention to what the accountants are doing, there is some benefit to having a firm perform multiple duties, he says. "It's hard to paint it over with a broad brush and say you can't have both relationships." 
Companies also note that some of the fees labeled as "nonaudit" under the new SEC rules are for services traditionally provided by auditors, such as work done on registration statements or on taxes. Renee Parnell, a spokeswoman for PG&E, says the company often has to use its accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP "for things like regulatory filings," adding that PG&E is "seeking SEC recommendation on whether to include the proposal" in its proxy. A spokeswoman for Disney declined to comment beyond what is written in the proxy, which recommends that shareholders vote against the proposal. Representatives from Apple, Motorola and Johnson & Johnson declined to comment. 
The shareholders' proposals aren't original in this sense: Two years ago, former SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr. sought to limit dual auditing/consulting roles for accounting firms. But his plan met fierce resistance from the accounting industry and its lobbyists, as well as from members of Congress, and he backed down, settling for less-stringent limits on certain types of nonauditing work. Mr. Levitt has said several congressmen threatened to cut the SEC's appropriations if he didn't back away from the tough conflict-of-interest rules he originally promoted. Current SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt has said he doesn't support the limitations sought by his predecessor, believing other reforms are more relevant. 
James D. Cox, a professor of law at Duke University who has written extensively on accounting and legal issues, says shareholder proposals may be the best way to change the rules. "There are a lot of investors out there, including financial institutions, who believe this is a good idea," he says. Before the Enron debacle, "we lulled ourselves into a complacent state thinking that accountants who know their client from performing nonaudit services can better perform the audit function. I think that's a mantra that after Enron is going to fall on deaf ears." 
Backers of the proposals say restricting the types of services accounting firms perform for clients won't eliminate the potential for fraud, but can help bolster confidence in public companies. "I don't think there's any benefit for a company if its accounting firm has a consulting relationship," says Ted O'Connor, portfolio manager at Cambiar Investors Inc., which owns shares of Motorola. He expects to vote for the proposal at Motorola.

NSC Aided Enron's Efforts; Agency Sought Lay Meeting With Indians on Plant

The White House's National Security Council is the president's nerve center for international crises and strategy. For a moment last year, it also acted as a sort of concierge service for Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay and India's national security adviser, Brajesh Mishra. 
A June e-mail sent from the NSC said Mishra would "be willing to meet with Mr. Lay and the bankers . . . but only at the residence. Pls. let me know your decision on this soonest." A second e-mail, also originating in the NSC, added, "We are not involved in arranging any meetings for Mr. Lay. . . . I will ask the Indians if he is invited to the dinner. Also, the Indians did not agree to see the lenders. I will go at them again, but if they come around it might be for a Friday meeting and not the dinner."
The efforts to get an audience with Indian officials for Lay and the bankers over the company's Dabhol power plant were detailed in documents released last week by the government-funded Overseas Private Investment Corp. under a Freedom of Information Act request. They provide a glimpse of a government function normally conducted in secret to avoid political embarrassment for foreign governments that face U.S. pressure on behalf of American corporations. 
Susan Schwab, a Commerce Department official from the first Bush administration and now dean of the University of Maryland's School of Public Affairs, said she was surprised that the commercial advocacy has become "one where it's not the State Department or Commerce Department but the NSC leading the working group." 
Daniel Tarullo, a Georgetown University law professor who oversaw international economics issues for President Bill Clinton's National Economic Council, concurred that "the norm would have been NSC participation in a discussion rather than NSC chairing it." 
That change is symbolic of the heightened government priority on aiding commercial interests overseas. The effort, which expanded in the first Bush administration and in the Clinton administration, is evolving to a more explicit link to national security as the Bush administration elevates ties between the NSC and economic and commercial considerations. 
"It's a new definition of national interest that embodies the national economic interest," Schwab said. "It's not as blatant as 'what's good for General Motors is good for America,' but it's the globalized version of that." 
The trend grew after the end of the Cold War, when it appeared American companies were not competitive with the Japanese and others. "It was a sense that our strategic position was at stake," said Leon Fuerth, who was security adviser to Vice President Al Gore. U.S. multinationals came to be seen as "agents of American national power." 
Under the Clinton administration, U.S. diplomats were evaluated on their performance in cooperating with American business, according to Stuart E. Eizenstat, who held a senior post in the State Department. "This was a major activity and something they were expected to engage in," he said. 
Even back then, Enron received a disproportionate share of government help -- not necessarily because of the company's political connections but because of its bold expansion into emerging markets. "With the possibility of Boeing, there is no U.S. company I had more interaction with, involved in more projects abroad [and] had more of a call on our time than Enron," Eizenstat said. 
The effort, which decelerated after Sept. 11, may have peaked last year with U.S. support for Enron in its dispute with India. At times it was difficult to separate Enron interests from national interests. In late August, Lay, frustrated with progress in India, told the Financial Times: "There are U.S. laws that could prevent the U.S. government from providing any aid or assistance to India going forward if, in fact, they expropriate property of U.S. companies." 
At the time, Enron was seeking $2.3 billion for itself and its lenders to sell its 65 percent interest in the Dabhol plant, which had been mired for years in a dispute with its main customer, an Indian state government. "If they try to squeeze us down to something less than cost, then it basically becomes an expropriation by the Indian government," Lay told the newspaper. 
The chief minister of Maharashtra state in India decried "the strong-arm tactics of Enron" he interpreted in Lay's words. Just two weeks before, the United States had indicated that it might lift sanctions imposed on India for earlier nuclear tests. 
Enron issued a statement the next day saying Lay "was merely referring to U.S. laws" and was not issuing a threat. Lay sent a letter to Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to say "I have not asked anyone in the U.S. government to consider sanctions. I did not say that the Dabhol power issue had been expropriated." 
The administration correspondence released last week suggested various overlaps between Enron and U.S. efforts in India. A July 30 memo to the "Dabhol Working Group" in the administration listed among the actions taken in July that "Enron Chairman Ken Lay visited India" and met various government officials. The Dabhol working group's plans in August included an "Enron trip" to a location that was blacked out on the document before the government released the information. 
September's actions by the Dabhol group were to include a visit by U.S. Trade Representative Robert B. Zoellick to India; Zoellick had been a paid consultant to Enron before joining the administration. Zoellick has since said he did not raise the issue. The group also planned to make use of a visit to the United Nations in September by Vajpayee. 
The NSC working group coordinated a push at the highest levels of government. Vice President Cheney, as reported, brought up the matter with Sonia Gandhi, leader of India's Congress Party. The e-mail exchanges indicate Cheney planned to raise the matter again on Oct. 3 with India's foreign minister. A list of "Dabhol talking points" for Cheney's meeting with the minister were "passed to Veep's staff for inclusion" by the NSC. The minister, Jaswant Singh, heard again from the administration in October, when Undersecretary of State Alan P. Larson raised Dabhol. 
Last weekend, the State Department disclosed that Secretary of State Colin L. Powell had discussed the Dabhol project on April 6 in a meeting with Singh. According to an account provided by State, Powell told his Indian counterpart that "failure to resolve the matter could have a serious deterrent effect on other investors." 
Before the November meeting between Vajpayee and Bush, at which Bush was to raise the subject of Dabhol, an e-mail apparently from the NSC to the Overseas Private Investment Corp. suggested a resolution was close. It asked: "Do you still want to sign an MOU [memorandum of understanding] with the Indians or announce one during Vajpayee's visit?" Plans for Bush to raise the subject were scratched as Enron's problems became public. 
The administration continues to talk about Dabhol, even after Enron's bankruptcy filing. Larson mentioned it with the Indians during a visit to New Delhi last week with Powell.

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE SECRETARY
Army Chief Being Challenged on Ties to Company
By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS

The New York Times

c. 2002 New York Times Company

WASHINGTON, Jan. 24 -- When Thomas E. White was chosen last spring to become secretary of the Army, administration officials portrayed his nomination as part of an effort to bring corporate discipline to the Pentagon. 
Mr. White, who had been vice chairman of Enron Energy Services, arrived with a boardroom boast that he and his private-sector colleagues were the new ''C.E.O.'s of wholly owned subsidiaries of the Department of Defense.''
But now an advocacy group founded by Ralph Nader contends that Mr. White's business dealings present a conflict of interest. The group, Public Citizen, is raising questions while Congress investigates the collapse of the Enron Corporation, which has filed for bankruptcy protection. 
Mr. White, through a spokesman, denied any wrongdoing. 
Public Citizen this week accused Mr. White of taking action to benefit Enron within weeks of becoming Army secretary. In remarks to the media in June, Mr. White vowed to accelerate efforts to privatize energy utilities serving the military. 
The privatization effort had slowed while California's energy crisis unfolded, but Enron continued to promote the program. Mr. White himself had lobbied on its behalf while at Enron, and in 1999 the energy division had been awarded a contract worth $25 million over 10 years to provide energy to Fort Hamilton in Brooklyn, Public Citizen said. 
''It's a huge conflict of interest,'' said Tyson Slocum, the group's research director. At the time of Mr. White's confirmation as Army secretary, Mr. Slocum said, Enron had seven bids pending at the Pentagon. 
A spokesman for Mr. White denied today that Mr. White had behaved inappropriately. The secretary had explicitly excused himself from decisions affecting Enron, but he was determined to advance efforts to privatize Defense Department services and save taxpayers money, said the spokesman, Lt. Col. Ryan Yantis. 
As part of a government ethics agreement, Mr. White was compelled to sell his shares in Enron. He was given 90 days to do so, then received an extension that gave him until Nov. 20 to complete the sale. He sold the last of his shares for $13 each in mid-October, just before the company disclosed the problems that led to its bankruptcy filing. 
Mr. White acknowledged having contacts with Enron employees since last June, including a call with Kenneth L. Lay, the chairman and chief executive, in September, but he called them personal in nature. 
Administration officials voiced confidence in Mr. White, and Congress members investigating the Enron collapse say they have no evidence that he acted in bad faith during his 11 years as an Enron executive or subsequently. 
Mr. White, in a letter to one investigator, Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, noted this week that he had incurred ''significant personal losses'' in the Enron bankruptcy. 
In the letter, which responded to questions by Mr. Waxman, Mr. White said he had briefly discussed Enron with Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld in November and with Secretary of State Colin L. Powell last month. 
''The nature of both conversations was a concern on their part for the impact that the bankruptcy of Enron may have had on my personal well-being,'' Mr. White wrote. ''My response in both cases was that I had suffered significant personal losses, but that I would persevere.'' 
Mr. White also detailed the 30 contacts he had with Enron employees since last June, involving both phone calls and personal meetings. The contacts included a telephone conversation on Sept. 10 with Mr. Lay. 
Mr. White initiated the call to Mr. Lay ''to wish him luck as he assumed his new duties as C.E.O. of Enron,'' Mr. White's letter said. The contacts with other Enron officials, he said, were all ''personal in nature, with their inquiring about my progress as Secretary of the Army and my inquiring about their personal challenges as they dealt with Enron's deteriorating financial conditions.'' 
Mr. White added that ''at no time'' did Mr. Lay or any other Enron employee ask him to intercede with federal officials on Enron's behalf. 
Mr. Waxman, the ranking Democrat on the Government Reform and Oversight Committee, is still studying Mr. White's letter, aides said, and was not available for comment. 
A review of Mr. White's financial disclosure information shows that he amassed a considerable fortune while working for Enron. 
According to his filings in May, Mr. White last received a salary of $5.5 million at Enron and owned homes in Naples, Fla., and Aspen, Colo., valued at more than $5 million each. He bought a $5.5 million penthouse in Washington last June. 
Mr. White held more Enron stock than any other senior official joining the Bush administration. According to the disclosure forms, he held $25 million to $50 million in Enron shares, $25 million to $50 million in stock options and $5 million to $25 million in a phantom stock award, which is a promise to pay a future bonus in appreciated stock or its cash equivalent. 
To comply with the ethics agreement, Mr. White was compelled to sell 405,710 shares of Enron. He made the sales, from June 13 to Oct. 14, 2001, as the value of Enron stock steadily diminished. For example, he sold 92,000 shares at $50 in mid-June and 86,709 shares at $13 in October. 
In his letter, Mr. White said he had sold all of his Enron stock and had renounced his stock options.

THE NATION With the Theater or PACs, Texans Saw Kenneth Lay as 'On Top of the World' Influence: The former Enron chief 'was a guy with swagger and loot who bought his way into whatever needed buying.'

HOUSTON -- For all his clout in Washington, Kenneth L. Lay's greatest influence was back home in Texas where the mirror-sheathed Enron headquarters building glimmers above the Houston skyline. 
Operating here in his home base, Lay--who resigned Wednesday night as chairman of the once high-flying energy trading company he founded--was a kingmaker who could create or crush political careers, spearhead professional sports stadium drives, finance youth clubs and endow theater troupes.
"This was a man on top of the world. It was well known that if you needed something done you went to Ken Lay," recalled Felix Fraga, a former Houston city councilman who has known Lay more than 30 years. "He could have run for mayor, governor, or done anything he wanted." 
As part of President Bush's celebrated "pioneers" club, Lay and his wife, Linda, donated more than $145,000 to the national Republican Party and the Bush campaign. The Lays also contributed $100,000 to the Bush inaugural gala and $10,000 to the election recount fund. 
But in Texas, where his money was less diluted, state Ethics Commission records show Lay gave $55,000 to one state Senate campaign alone. Other large contributions graced the coffers of Gov. Rick Perry, Atty. Gen. John Cornyn and Houston Mayor Lee P. Brown, for whom Lay sponsored a $50,000 fund-raiser Oct. 8. 
However, in a sign that Enron fortunes were already on a slide, Brown campaign finance director Sue Walden said Lay failed to show up for the fund-raiser and never sent a check. 
Always the Go-To Guy 
Over the years, Texas officeholders ranging from Houston City Council members to state railroad commissioners benefited from Lay's political largess. 
"Ken Lay was a guy with swagger and loot who bought his way into whatever needed buying," said Texas populist politician and commentator Jim Hightower. "He had this aura of being bulletproof, a corporate superstar who was real connected to the Bushes." 
After Lay's spectacular fall from power and grace, the extent of Lay's and Enron's insertion into Texas government only now is surfacing. 
The first casualty was Texas Public Utilities Commission chairman Max Yzaguirre, a former Enron executive Lay helped get appointed as the state's chief utility regulator. Yzaguirre, tainted by his Enron connections, resigned his post Jan. 17. 
Others caught in the backwash of the Enron collapse are Perry, who received a $25,000 contribution from Lay the day after he appointed Yzaguirre to direct the PUC; Cornyn, a U.S. Senate candidate who reversed an earlier position and recused himself from the state Enron investigation because of donations he received from Lay and Enron; and Texas elected Supreme Court Justice Priscilla Owens, whose appointment by Bush to the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals now is in jeopardy because of Enron contributions she received beginning in 1995 and decisions she made favoring the company. 
According to Rice University political scientist Bob Stein, Lay displayed a particular genius for picking out politicians on the rise. 
"These were investments about where these guys were going, not necessarily where they were at the time," Stein said. "Ken Lay was a big supporter of Bush probably before Bush himself knew he was running for president." 
According to the Austin-based watchdog group Texans for Public Justice, the Lays personally donated $122,000 to Bush's two gubernatorial campaigns. Similarly, Lay was an early backer of Cornyn, even before the Republican attorney general announced his candidacy for the seat to be vacated by Republican Sen. Phil Gramm, who is retiring after this year's elections. 
Payroll Deductions to the Company PAC 
Gramm, whose economist wife served as a paid member of the Enron board of directors, is caught up in the vortex because of the tens of thousands of dollars he received in contributions from Enron and Lay. 
Enron's system for political contributions operated on two fronts. Employees were encouraged to give money to candidates believed to be supportive of company issues, particularly those involving market deregulation central to the energy trading business. 
Additionally, top executives were tapped for what amounted to a tithe to the Enron Political Action Committee, one of the country's biggest corporate political PACs. A percentage of each executive's paycheck was withheld from every biweekly pay period. For example, Joe Allen, Enron vice president for state government affairs, gave $83.34 every two weeks to the Enron PAC, for an annual total of $2,166. Other executives gave much more. 
The money primarily was used to fund campaigns of candidates for Congress, particularly those with key energy-related positions. According to documents on file with the Texas Ethics Commission, the Enron PAC collected $336,000 from executives in 2001. 
But not all of Lay's and Enron's munificence was reserved for major political offices, nor was it limited to politics. 
Spreading Wealth Among Nonprofits 
One of the largest political contributions Lay made in 2001 was for a state Senate race in the Piney Woods of rural East Texas. In that race, one of the most expensive legislative races ever undertaken in Texas, Democratic trial lawyer David Marsh was pitted against Republican businessman/rancher Todd Staples. 
The race became a key contest for the Houston-based Texans for Lawsuit Reform, a conservative movement Lay supports that seeks to limit lawsuits. Staples won, backed by $55,000 in contributions from Lay. 
Even in the grandest Texas tradition of alms giving and support for the arts, few have surpassed Lay and his company. 
The Lays and Enron were prominent givers to virtually every important Houston charity ranging from a new cancer ward at the city's famous M.D. Anderson Hospital to support for the Houston Ballet. 
Lay encouraged giving by offering matching funds for as much as $15,000 for each employee. The results often were spectacular. Enron's 7,500 employees alone, led by Lay with a $100,000 pledge, accounted for $5.5 million of the $75 million raised by the Houston United Way campaign. 
"Enron was a visible leader in the charity world," said Houston Ballet managing director Cecil C. Conner, whose troupe received a $10,000 gift from the Lays. "It helped make this city a vibrant, important city, not just an oil town. We have lost a leading voice." 
Occasionally, Lay's influence went beyond money. 
When former City Councilman Fraga, 72, a longtime social worker and prominent leader in the Latino community, found himself snared in a 1997 FBI bribery sting operation that sent another councilman to jail, Lay was one of the prominent Houstonians who wrote a letter in Fraga's support. 
After returning the $2,000 offered by two undercover agents, Fraga never was charged. 
But Lay may be missed most as a civic leader. He served a term as president of the Greater Houston Partnership, the city's influential super-chamber of commerce. Before that he served as head of the Board of Regents at the University of Houston, where he received his graduate education. 
According to political scientist Stein, Lay was instrumental in the revival of Houston's historically moribund downtown, including the successful referendums to build stadiums for baseball and basketball/hockey, the building of a light rail line connecting Houston's renowned medical center complex to downtown and development of the theater district. 
"Ken Lay was a great promoter of the city," Stein said. "His business was based on attracting productive capital and labor, and when it worked, it worked to make the city a more attractive place to live." 
Scrambling for a New Look 
But even this legacy already is fading, as Lay's and Enron's woes continue to deepen. On a recent afternoon in Houston's gritty 2nd Ward District, the Enron Boys and Girls Club, renovated with $500,000 in Enron donations, was busy changing its name. The Enron logo on the center of the newly resurfaced basketball court was being sanded off and replaced with the new sponsor's name: Holt House. 
"We've already got us a new sponsor," said club director Glen Sherrod, showing a reporter a roomful of new computers donated by Enron. 
In a statement issued Thursday, Mayor Brown made no mention of Lay's role in rebuilding the city. 
"My fervent hope," Brown said, "is that Enron is able to hire a CEO who can put the company back in a position to rehire its employees and remain a viable part of the business community."

Spreading It Around

c. 2002 New York Times Company

A bizarre thing happened to me over the past week: Conservative newspapers and columnists made a concerted effort to portray me as a guilty party in the Enron scandal. Why? Because in 1999, before coming to The New York Times, I was briefly paid to serve on an Enron advisory board. 
Never mind that, scrupulously following the Times conflict of interest rules, I resigned from that board as soon as I agreed to write for this newspaper -- making me much more fastidious than, say, William Kristol, who served on that same board while editing The Weekly Standard. Never mind that I disclosed that past connection a year ago, the first time I wrote about Enron in this column -- and also disclosed it the one time I mentioned Enron before, in a Fortune column. Never mind that the compensation I received per day was actually somewhat less than other companies were paying me at the time for speeches on world economic issues.
And never mind that when I started writing in this column about issues of concern to Enron -- in particular, criticizing the role that market manipulation by energy companies played in the California power crisis -- my position was not at all what the company wanted to hear. (Compare this with the board member Lawrence Kudlow, a commentator for National Review and CNBC. He wrote vehemently in favor of the Cheney energy plan -- and has called this the ''Clinton-Levitt recession,'' blaming Arthur Levitt, the former Securities and Exchange Commission chairman, who tried to fight the accounting laxity that made Enron possible.) 
Yet reading those attacks, you would think that I was a major-league white-collar criminal. 
It's tempting to take this vendetta as a personal compliment: Some people are so worried about the effect of my writing that they will try anything to get me off this page. But actually it was part of a broader effort by conservatives to sling Enron muck toward their left, hoping that some of it would stick. 
A few days ago Tim Noah published a very funny piece in Slate about this effort, titled ''Blaming liberalism for Enron.'' (Full disclosure: I used to write a column for Slate -- and Slate is owned by Microsoft. So I guess that makes me a Bill Gates crony. I even shook his hand once.) It describes the strategies conservative pundits have used to shift the blame for the Enron scandal onto the other side of the political spectrum. 
Among the ploys: Enron was in favor of the Kyoto treaty, because it thought it could make money trading emission permits; see, environmentalism is the villain. Or how about this: Enron made money by exploiting the quirks of electricity markets that had been only partly deregulated; see, regulation is the villain. 
And, of course -- you knew this was coming -- it's all a reflection of Clinton-era moral decline. Traditionally, as we all know, Texas businessmen and politicians were models of probity; they never cooked their books or engaged in mutual back-scratching. 
One doubts that the people putting out this stuff really expect to convince anyone. But they do hope to muddy the waters. If they can get a little bit of Enron dirt on everyone -- the Clinton administration, environmentalists, liberal columnists -- the stain on people and ideas they support will be less noticeable. 
Why is Enron a problem for conservatives? Even if the Bush administration turns out to be squeaky clean, which we'll never know unless it starts to be more forthcoming, the scandal threatens perceptions that the right has spent decades creating. After all that effort to discredit concerns about the gap between haves and have-nots as obsolete ''class warfare,'' along comes a real-life story that reads like a leftist morality play: wealthy executives make off with millions while ordinary workers lose their jobs and their life savings. After all that effort to convince people that the private sector can police itself, the most admired company in America turns out to have been a giant Ponzi scheme -- and the most respected accounting firm turns out to have been an accomplice. 
You might think that the shock of the Enron scandal -- and it is shocking, even to us hardened cynics -- would make some conservatives reconsider their beliefs. But the die-hards prefer to sling muck at liberals, hoping it will stick. 
Sorry, guys; I'm clean. The muck stops here.

Enron Fraud: Appoint a Special Prosecutor

Re Enron: Let's get this straight. Fraud is fraud. 
Enron executives have conspired with their auditors to cook the books to wildly inflate profits and stock prices, failed to report illegal transactions, broken multiple rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and then instituted a cover-up by a massive destruction of files and evidence. The result has been literally billions of dollars of losses to investors and the virtual destruction of employee 401(k)s, while they manipulated their personal stock options and walked away with millions in illegal profits.
Our attorney general, the overly pious John Ashcroft, has excused himself for conflicts of interest, as has the entire federal prosecutor's office in Houston. The administration is staffed by multiple "graduates" of Enron and is tainted by massive campaign contributions, as are large numbers of representatives and senators of both parties. Isn't it time for a special prosecutor?

Regarding all the calls I see for a special prosecutor in the Enron case, with its ties to the Bush administration, I can only say this: a special prosecutor for what? 
Until someone can make some sort of illegal connection between the two there is nothing but guilt by association. 
When a special prosecutor was assigned to the Whitewater matter, at least there was evidence of a shady land deal and inappropriate pressure being put on people by then-Gov. Clinton to make improper loans, for example. 
No linkage of this sort has been made between Enron and President Bush. 
And until a linkage is made, all these shouts and murmurs for a prosecutor are nothing but shameless partisanship.

I came away from "Why Insiders Get Rich and the Little Guy Pays" (Opinion, Jan. 20) ashamed to be a little guy. While we're busy vilifying the fat cats at Enron and other larcenous corporations for sticking it to us, it might be wise for us "littles" to examine our own culpability in the sticking. 
Union membership is at historical lows; we allow our representatives to green-light monopolistic mergers, and we continue to elect politicians who ignore or undermine real campaign finance reform. 
Until we start protecting ourselves from corporate avarice, we will continue to be perfect "little" victims.

I fail to understand why President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney are trying to distance themselves from former Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay. 
Lay is without question an exemplar of Republican values. Having taken advantage of his position of privilege to maximize his personal wealth, whatever the consequences, this role model of Republican values is at least due a presidential commendation.

Is it a coincidence that both Enron and its auditing firm Andersen started massive document shredding operations about the same time? It may be a concerted effort to make sure that all the documents no longer exist. The investigation will be greatly hindered without documents to support the allegations, especially of criminal wrongdoing. 
Welcome to the new economy highly touted by this administration.

What slays me is that high-ranking CEOs in large companies quickly learn how to get big money for themselves but in actuality they do not know how to run a profitable business. This includes successful orchestration of deregulation that is also for their further benefit.

Business Spin; It's just like political spin, only not quite as dishonest.

How could the chairman of Enron have been telling his employees that they should buy the company's stock at the same time he was selling it? How could Ken Lay have been saying that the company was in great shape when he had a report from one of his vice presidents saying it most definitely wasn't? 
Well, it might have been an innocent mistake. You don't need to believe every report that crosses your desk. If some of your own actions had slipped your mind, you might find them as hard to believe as anyone else would. And you might be selling your stock for reasons other than concern that it might be about to tank.
So now that we've gotten the presumption of innocence out of the way, let's consider two other possibilities. One is that he was lying. The other is that he was spinning. What's the difference? It's often said that there is none. (Come to think of it, I've said this myself.) But there is: Lying means flouting the truth. Spinning means indifference to the truth. The culture of spin is one in which the relation between what you're saying and what happens to be true is a question that doesn't even arise. This doesn't make spin less objectionable. In fact, it's more objectionable precisely because it's culturally ingrained. We all know that it's wrong to lie. The signals we send and receive about spin are very different. 
The political equivalent of Ken Lay would be a politician who insisted he was going to win the election even though all the polls showed him heading for near-certain defeat. In the political world, though, spin is not merely tolerated: It is required. It is regarded as a basic test of competence. 
Tim Russert: Senator, you're down by 40 points in every poll. Your opponent is openly consulting real-estate agents in Washington. Your own dog called a news conference yesterday to demand that you withdraw from the race. Are you going to lose? 
Politician: No, Tim, it'll be a tough fight -- make no mistake about that -- but I'm confident that . . . blah blah blah. And my cat is behind me 100 percent. 
The purpose of such exchanges is not to elicit the truth, but to see how well the politician can spin. If he admits that he's probably going to lose, he flunks. If he survives the barrage with his preposterous optimism and poker face unbroken, he wins. 
But this example is entry-level spin. It shows a basic willingness to ignore reality, but no special effort or talent in creating an alternative reality. The other difference between lying and spinning is that while lying is often spontaneous, spinning usually involves advanced planning. There are a few naturally gifted improvisational spinners, such as the brilliant White House spokesman, Ari Fleischer. Characteristically, though, spin does not wing it. Often spin production is an industrial process involving many people, maybe or maybe not including the person who ultimately delivers it. 
In recent years the Washington spin industry has invaded the corporate world, as professional spinmeisters who learned their craft from politicians (or who actually used to be politicians) have come to realize that big companies are just as spinologically needy as politicians and have more money. Of course, the corporate world is where PR and advertising were invented -- two activities that also strain the relationship between assertion and truth. But in some ways spin, or at least untruthful spin, remains less acceptable in the corporate world than in politics. 
One reason for this is that in spinning a commercial product -- which goes by the polite name of "marketing" -- the mountain can come to Mohammed. That is, you can design the product around the spin rather than design the spin around the product. John Kenneth Galbraith argued 35 years ago in "The New Industrial State" that corporations often create the demand for their products rather than satisfy hungers that already exist. Controversial at the time, this now seems obvious. And when marketing is paramount, the product itself is secondary. Oddly, this makes it easier for corporate spin to be truthful: You can decide what you want to say and build reality around it. Businesspeople used to marketing sometimes trip up when they forget that reality is less malleable in non-marketing situations. 
Spin is also illegal in many corporate circumstances where it would be legal, acceptable and even expected in politics. If a corporate insider knows something important about the company's future, he or she not only may not say something that directly contradicts the truth -- in most circumstances they may not even spin by silence. Imagine if politicians were under that kind of legal requirement! And why aren't they? Well, obviously because money is at stake with the business executive whereas nothing depends on the politician's truthfulness except democracy. 
In the pervasive culture of spin, it's possible that Ken Lay was describing a reality he wanted without even considering the relation of what he was saying to reality as we actually experience it. If so, his mistake was forgetting that he's not a politician.

ENRON'S COLLAPSE
Excerpts From a House Hearing on Destruction of Enron Documents

01/25/2002
The New York Times
Page 8, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

Following are excerpts from remarks at a hearing yesterday before the House Energy and Commerce Committee on the destruction of documents related to the Enron Corporation, as recorded by the Federal Document Clearing House, a private transcription service. The speakers included Representatives James C. Greenwood, Peter Deutsch, Billy Tauzin and Diana DeGette; the Arthur Andersen officials C. E. Andrews, Dorsey L. Baskin and Nancy Temple; and David B. Duncan, a former partner at Arthur Andersen. 
REPRESENTATIVE GREENWOOD -- The chair will now call the first panel. 
Mr. Duncan, will you please come forward? Please be seated right there. Thank you, sir. 
Good morning, Mr. Duncan.
DAVID DUNCAN -- Morning. 
MR. GREENWOOD -- Mr. Duncan is here with us today under subpoena. To date, Mr. Duncan has cooperated with this committee in our search for the facts by submitting to an interview last week with our committee investigator that lasted more than four hours. 
Yet, we received a letter from his counsel yesterday stating that Mr. Duncan authorized his counsel to advise the committee that he will, quote, ''rely on his constitutional right not to testify,'' close quote. 
I believe that this privilege should be personally exercised by, before the members, and that's why we have requested Mr. Duncan's appearance here today and request that he reconsider. 
Mr. Duncan, you are aware that the committee is holding an investigative hearing and that, when doing so, we have the practice of taking testimony under oath. Do you have objection to testifying under oath? 
MR. DUNCAN -- No, sir. 
MR. GREENWOOD -- Thank you. 
The chair also advises you that, under the rules of the House and the rules of the committee, you are entitled to be advised by counsel. 
Do you desire to be advised by counsel during your testimony today? 
MR. DUNCAN -- Yes, sir. 
MR. GREENWOOD -- O.K. In that case, would you please rise and raise your right hand, and I will swear you in. 
Mr. Duncan, do you swear that you will tell -- the testimony you will give this committee is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth? 
MR. DUNCAN -- Yes, I do. 
MR. GREENWOOD -- Thank you, Mr. Duncan. You are now under oath, and you may give a five-minute summary of your written testimony if you choose to. 
MR. DUNCAN -- I have no summary, sir. 
MR. GREENWOOD -- O.K. The chair will recognize himself for questioning. 
Mr. Duncan, Enron robbed the bank. Arthur Andersen provided the getaway car, and they say you were at the wheel. 
I have a specific question for you, Mr. Duncan. You were fired by Andersen last week for orchestrating an expedited effort among the Andersen-Enron engagement team to destroy thousands of paper documents and electronic files relating to the Enron matter after learning of an inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission into Enron's complex financial transactions. 
Did you give an order to destroy documents in an attempt to subvert governmental investigations into Enron's financial collapse? And if so, did you do so at the direction or suggestion of anyone at Andersen or at Enron? 
MR. DUNCAN -- Mr. Chairman, I would like to answer the committee's questions, but on the advice of my counsel I respectfully decline to answer the question based on the protection afforded me under the Constitution of the United States. 
MR. GREENWOOD -- Let me be clear, Mr. Duncan. Are you refusing to answer the question on the basis of the protections afforded to you under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution? 
MR. DUNCAN -- Again, on the advice of my counsel, I respectfully decline to answer the question based on the protection afforded me under the United States Constitution. 
MR. GREENWOOD -- Will you invoke your Fifth Amendment rights in response to all of our questions here today? 
MR. DUNCAN -- Respectfully, that will be my response to all your questions. 
MR. GREENWOOD -- I'm disappointed to hear that, but it is therefore the chair's intention to dismiss the witness. 
Mr. Duncan, we thank you for your attendance today and your respect for this committee's process. You are dismissed, and perhaps we will see you on another occasion. 
MR. DUNCAN -- Yes, sir. . . . 
MR. GREENWOOD -- I think it is very important to lay out for the subcommittee, our panel and our audience our current understanding of Mr. Duncan's recollection of relevant events based on the committee counsel's interview of Mr. Duncan last week. 
It is my understanding that Mr. Duncan said that, in the September and October time period, he participated in frequent meetings and teleconferences with a group of senior-level Andersen partners in Houston and Chicago to discuss matters relating to the Enron account. 
That group included Ms. Nancy Temple from the legal group and Mr. Michael Odom, the audit practice director, both of whom are testifying today. 
The consultation group, which was created in late August or early September, was fluid in membership and was formed in response to growing concerns over the accounting for Enron's special-purpose entities. 
Specifically, Mr. Duncan said that the group was formed at the suggestion of Mr. Odom and himself in response to, one, Sherron Watkins' allegations of accounting improprieties on the Enron Raptor and LJM transactions; two, the $1 billion accounting error discovered in August by Enron and Andersen with respect to the accounting for the Raptor entities; and, three, the rapidly declining stock price of the Enron merchant assets transferred to the Raptor partnerships, which made it look like there would be a significant write-down by Enron. 
During these conference calls prior to Oct. 12, 2001, Mr. Duncan recalls receiving advice from Ms. Temple with respect to the proper documentation of Andersen's evolving position with respect to the correct accounting for the Raptor transactions. 
Also, prior to receiving Ms. Temple's Oct. 12 e-mail regarding compliance with Andersen's documentation retention policy, Mr. Duncan recalls Ms. Temple, on one or two of these three group conference calls, asking him, quote, ''How are you on compliance with the document retention policy on Enron?'' He said that his response to her was, ''At best, irregular.'' 
Mr. Duncan then received Ms. Temple's Oct. 12 e-mail, forwarding from Mr. Odom with a note, quote, ''More help,'' close quote. He did not know what Mr. Odom meant by that phrase, but he viewed Ms. Temple's e-mail as a follow-up to the question she had posed to him orally about compliance with the retention policy and as a device from his attorney to ensure that the entire Enron audit engagement team was in compliance with that policy. 
He added that he had never before, during his lengthy tenure at Andersen, been asked about compliance with the retention policy, nor had he ever received such an e-mail about ensuring compliance with that policy from anyone in Andersen's legal group. 
Mr. Duncan does not recall the precise date, but sometime after Oct. 12, 2001, Mr. Duncan met with his top Enron audit partners, Mr. Tom Bauer, Ms. Debra Cash and Mr. Roger Willard, to discuss the advice he had received from Ms. Temple. 
According to Mr. Duncan, the meeting participants concluded that they should call a meeting of all the Enron audit managers to discuss timely compliance with the retention policy. 
Mr. Duncan does not recall when this meeting occurred but does not dispute that his secretary sent out an e-mail on Oct. 23, 2001, calling an urgent meeting of the Enron managers for later that same day. 
Just days earlier, on either Friday, Oct. 19, or Saturday, Oct. 20, Mr. Duncan had first learned of the S.E.C. informal inquiry of Enron. He recalled that he had discussions with the Andersen consultation group about the S.E.C. development over the weekend, including Ms. Temple. 
He also recalled that on Oct. 22 he and other Andersen engagement team members met with Enron chief accounting officer Rick Causey to discuss the S.E.C. inquiry. Duncan said that Causey requested Andersen's assistance in creating documents to explain the related party transactions to the S.E.C. 
Mr. Duncan said that at the meeting he called with all the Andersen audit managers on the Enron account, whenever it may have occurred, he advised them of the importance of compliance with the document retention policy and handed out copies of the policy to participants. 
Mr. Duncan said that he observed individuals on the engagement team actively complying with the firm's document policies by shredding documents, and that the activity continued up until the 9th of November, when he received a voice mail from Ms. Temple ordering the preservation of all Enron-related documents. 
Mr. Duncan also said that he destroyed some of his own Enron-related documents in an effort to comply with Andersen's document retention and destruction policies. 
Again, that is my understanding of Mr. Duncan's interview with committee staff. 
Mr. Deutsch, would you agree that I have characterized our current understanding of Mr. Duncan's recollection of relevant events accurately? . . . 
MR. DEUTSCH -- I would. 
MR. GREENWOOD -- Thank you. 
MR. BASKIN -- My name is Dorsey Lee Baskin Jr. 
Since 1999, I have been managing director of Andersen's assurance professional standards group, which has firm-wide responsibility for providing guidance on auditing standards, including professional standards relating to the preservation of audit work papers and client files. I've been at Andersen for almost 25 years, since receiving my M.B.A. from Texas A&M University in 1977. 
I'm here with my partner, C. E. Andrews, who is managing partner for Andersen's global audit practice. He and I will both answer the committee's questions. 
I would like to make three essential points at the outset of our testimony. First, as our C.E.O. has said, this is indeed a tragedy on many levels. 
Second, the committee and the broader public should know that Andersen came forward voluntarily and disclosed the destruction of documents by Andersen personnel. However improper that destruction was, Andersen did not hide from its obligation to do what it could to take corrective action. We promptly alerted all investigative authorities, including this committee. 
Although the firm was well aware of the potentially devastating impact this disclosure could have on our reputation, we did the right thing. We certainly are not proud of the document destruction, but we are proud of our decision to step forward and accept responsibility. 
Third, it bears emphasis that Andersen has cooperated fully and unreservedly with all of the ongoing investigations into the destruction of Enron-related documents. We are determined to get to the bottom of what happened. 
We have publicly acknowledged, and will continue to acknowledge, mistakes that we have made. We have tried, and will continue to try, to answer every question that is put to us. And we will take whatever decisive action is necessary to restore public confidence in the firm. 
I have to tell you, in all candor, that we are limited in what we can say today about the destruction of documents by Andersen personnel working on the Enron engagement. 
Our investigation into that destruction is far from complete. We have not yet had the opportunity to review all of the many relevant documents or to hear from all of the people who have relevant information. 
But having said that, this is what I can tell you about Andersen's retention and destruction of documents. 
To begin with, it is the usual, routine and wholly legitimate practice of auditors to preserve their final working papers while disposing of drafts, personal notes and other materials that are not necessary to support the audit report. So far as I'm aware, this is the policy of all the large accounting firms. 
This policy toward document disposal reflects longstanding and sound audit practice. It is designed to assure that the audit work papers, which are the principal materials reflecting and documenting the conclusions of the audit, unambiguously reflect the judgments that actually were reached. 
This understanding of proper audit practice was reflected in the Andersen document retention policy in effect last fall, which provided that documents other than work papers ordinarily should be disposed of when no longer needed but that such documents should be retained when litigation has commenced or is threatened. 
Of course, precisely when that occurs, often we'll require the application of informed judgment to the particular circumstances of a given case. And that may well be a point on which reasonable people can differ. 
As for the destruction of Enron-related documents, we know that on Oct. 23, just six days after the S.E.C. requested information from Enron, David Duncan, Andersen's lead partner on the Enron engagement, called an urgent meeting of the Enron engagement team, at which he organized an expedited effort to shred or otherwise dispose of Enron-related documents. 
This effort was undertaken without any consultation with others in the firm or, so far as we are aware, with legal counsel. 
Over the course of the next several days, a very substantial volume of documents and e-mails were disposed of by the Enron engagement team. This activity appears to have stopped shortly after Mr. Duncan's assistant sent an e-mail to other secretaries on Nov. 9, the day after Andersen received a subpoena from the S.E.C. telling them, ''No more shredding.'' 
Once this activity came to light, Andersen's response was immediate. Andersen notified the Department of Justice, the S.E.C. and all relevant congressional committees. At the same time, the firm suspended its records management policy and asked former Senator Danforth to conduct an immediate and comprehensive review. 
On Jan. 15, approximately two weeks after our C.E.O. learned about the document destruction, Andersen dismissed Mr. Duncan. The firm also placed three other partners from the Enron engagement on administrative leave, pending completion of the investigation into their responsibility for these events. 
The firm relieved four partners in its Houston office of their management responsibilities, and the firm indicated that it will take disciplinary action against any Andersen personnel who are found to have acted improperly. 
I should address the question, why Andersen took the forceful action it did regarding Mr. Duncan. In our view, Mr. Duncan's actions reflected a failure of judgment that is simply unacceptable in a person who has major responsibilities at our firm. 
He was the lead engagement partner for a significant client, exercising very substantial responsibility within the firm. Yet our investigation indicated that he directed the purposeful destruction of a very substantial volume of documents just as the government investigation was beginning. This is the kind of conduct that Andersen cannot tolerate. 
When Andersen's C.E.O., Joe Berardino, testified before Congress almost six weeks ago, he observed that all of us here today, and many others who are not here, have a responsibility to seek out and evaluate the facts and take needed action. 
We have tried to fulfill that responsibility. We uncovered the document destruction. Our firm's management brought it to the attention of the governmental authorities. 
We already have started to implement decisive disciplinary and remedial action, and we're continuing our investigation resolved to take all steps that are necessary to restore public confidence in the integrity of our firm. . . . 
MR. GREENWOOD -- Let me turn it to Ms. Temple, and since I don't have any other members here right now, I'll continue with the questioning. 
We have a memo from you, Ms. Temple, that's dated, I believe, Nov. 10. . . . 
And that memo is very explicit and it's very clear that you took action on that date in the form of that memo to make it crystal clear that no one was to destroy documents. 
Can you explain to us why it took you until Nov. 10 to issue a statement with that clarity, when, a month ago, you knew that the question of retention and destruction of documents was going to be critical to investigations and to litigation? 
MS. TEMPLE -- Yes, Mr. Chairman, I'll tell you the circumstances of sending the Nov. 10 memo and the facts, as I understood them, in the previous time period. 
On Nov. 10, the memo we sent, it was drafted by our outside counsel, a law firm, Davis Polk & Wardwell. 
MR. GREENWOOD -- When was that firm retained for this purpose? 
MS. TEMPLE -- I did not personally retain that law firm. I know I spoke to a partner at that law firm on Oct. 16. 
MR. GREENWOOD -- Is your testimony that you do not know when they were retained? 
MS. TEMPLE -- I don't recall the exact date of the retention. I know I spoke to a partner at that law firm on Oct. 16. 
MR. GREENWOOD -- O.K., you may proceed. 
MS. TEMPLE -- It is the legal group's practice and protocol, when Arthur Andersen receives a subpoena or a request for documents, to send a written notification ---- 
MS. TEMPLE -- My recollection, the firm received a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission at the end of the business day on Nov. 8. And a voice mail was distributed to the audit engagement team, notifying them of that the following business day. And once this e-mail was drafted, it was circulated to the engagement team. 
Now, moving back in time frame to the previous period that you talked about, the firm does have a written policy that provides guidance. It is self-enforcing, and we trust our partners to exercise their good judgment and to consult with either the legal group or the practice directors as appropriate. 
MR. GREENWOOD -- Let me interrupt you for a second. I asked Ms. Temple when Davis Polk was retained for this purpose, and she indicated that she, her response was that she didn't know. 
Mr. Baskin, Mr. Andrews, do you know when this firm was retained? 
And I will remind you that I asked you last night to be prepared to answer that question this morning. 
MR. ANDREWS -- Mr. Chairman, the firm was retained on Oct. 9 and commenced work with us on Oct. 16. 
MR. GREENWOOD -- O.K. And what was the purpose for retaining that firm on Oct. 9? 
MR. ANDREWS -- Well, as if we -- just for a moment -- what was going on during that particular period of time, around that Oct. 9 time ---- 
MR. GREENWOOD -- Are they handling the potential litigation for the firm now? 
MR. ANDREWS -- But what they were, are they handling it now? Yes, they are. 
What was going on at that particular time was that we were involved, the company was closing its third quarter. They were about to reach conclusions on the third quarter. There were a lot of financial reporting issues occurring during that period that were obviously unusual and were concerning. So we engaged them to help us with the financial reporting issues and with possible litigation. 
MR. GREENWOOD -- Mr. Baskin or Mr. Andrews, or even Ms. Temple, you may want to answer this question. 
The document in Tab 29 in your binder is a copy of an Enron announcement to its employees and others on the Enron worldwide e-mail list, which I believe includes Andersen, on Oct. 25, 2001, telling them to preserve records relating to the related party transactions including the accounting of those transactions. 
Did Andersen learn about this action by Enron, which by the way also seems rather late given that it is eight days after Enron learned of the S.E.C. inquiry? And if so, why didn't Andersen act right then to order its employees to do the same? 
MR. BASKIN -- Well, as it pertains to --this is the first time I've read this memo -- but as it pertains to our actions, again, we believe that it was the engagement partners' responsibility in this situation, given what was occurring in that late-October period, which is the date of this memo, that there was enough information available that, in that partner's judgment, the instruction and oversight of that partner would in fact cause us not to destroy documents. And certainly, you would not convene a meeting and give instructions, if you will -- apparently that's what happened -- to destroy documents. 
So we would agree that during this period it would be appropriate to, at a minimum, seek counsel before doing such an exercise. 
And destruction of documents in that period is wrong, and we have admitted that. It is wrong. And once we learned of that in our investigation, we took firm actions. That is not Andersen, that is not what we encourage our employees to do, and it is inappropriate. . . . 
REPRESENTATIVE TAUZIN -- The gentleman's time has expired. The chair recognizes himself for a round of questions. 
First of all, I want to turn to the week of Oct. 9. Now, you've testified Oct. 9 was the date that Arthur Andersen hired counsel, outside counsel, right? And the outside counsel firm was Davis Polk & Wardwell of New York, right? Is that correct, sir? Mr. Andrews? 
MR. ANDREWS -- Yes, that's correct. 
MR. TAUZIN -- My understanding is that's a litigation team, right? 
MR. ANDREWS -- Davis Polk is a reputable firm. I'm sure they do litigation in other things, but we hired them for purposes to help us with the financial reporting and possible litigation. 
MR. TAUZIN -- And possible litigation, right? 
MR. ANDREWS -- Yes, sir. 
MR. TAUZIN -- This Oct. 9 -- I want to turn to you, Ms. Temple, real quickly. Sometime before the week of Oct. 12, in your interviews with us, you informed us that there was a conference call about the Enron engagement team's compliance with the document retention policy. 
Mr. Duncan says that it was you who raised the question about the retention policy. You had some other recollections of that conversation. 
Give us your recollections of what happened in that conference call. And what date was that? 
MS. TEMPLE -- Sure. Let me give you the context of my role in this matter. 
I was asked, beginning on Sept. 28, 2001, to participate in a conference call. I understood that the firm was addressing one accounting issue that had arisen at that point in time. 
And between that time and Oct. 12, I provided legal advice, including, after consultation with my supervisor and others, about specific documentation and retention issues. 
MR. TAUZIN -- Ms. Temple, in that conversation, though, that occurred right about the time that the firm was hiring other litigation counsel -- you're the litigation attorney for the firm, isn't that correct? 
MS. TEMPLE -- My background is in litigation, yes. 
MR. TAUZIN -- But they just hired an outside litigation firm to advise them on possible litigation. About the same time, there's a conference call and there's a discussion about the retention policy. And obviously, the memo is sent out following it regarding that policy that includes information about destruction of documents as well. 
You said something to our investigators about conversations in that conference call, referencing changing memos and deleting information from past memos, substituting a memo to the file for an old memo with a new memo. Is that accurate? Was that discussion held in that conference call? 
MS. TEMPLE -- The advice I gave was different from that, Mr. Chairman. The advice I gave was ---- 
MR. TAUZIN -- What were the questions being asked that you had to give advice? 
MS. TEMPLE -- The team was discussing a draft of a memo about a particular accounting issue on asset impairment. The advice that my supervisor and I gave initially was that that memo, which was being currently drafted, needed to be dated currently ---- 
MR. TAUZIN -- But what did they want to do that you told them they couldn't do? What did they ask you to do? 
MS. TEMPLE -- I don't recall with respect to that particular legal advice that there was a question raised, but we pointed out to the team ---- 
MR. TAUZIN -- Was there not a request or discussion of substituting a new memo for an old memo and, in effect, backdating a memo to the file? 
MS. TEMPLE -- No, there was not a question about backdating that particular memo, but the date ---- 
MR. TAUZIN -- Was there a question about substituting it and deleting information from the memo? 
MS. TEMPLE -- There was a question in that current memo that was raised, can we delete a sentence, acknowledging that the firm had given incorrect accounting advice in the first quarter of 2001 ---- 
MR. TAUZIN -- What I want to know is ---- 
MS. TEMPLE -- ---- and I said absolutely not. 
MR. TAUZIN -- What I want to know is, essentially, you said don't do that. 
MS. TEMPLE -- Right. 
MR. TAUZIN -- Is it customary that in those kind of discussions, when the firm finds itself in error, that anyone would suggest substituting memos or deleting information that was in memos already in the file? Was that unusual conversation? 
MS. TEMPLE -- I expect the engagement partners to raise questions about documentation and seek advice, which they were doing. 
The other legal advice that I gave on documentation was, the memos for any prior periods, first quarter of 2001, year-end 2000, could not be changed or deleted. 
MR. TAUZIN -- You're telling them no changes. I understand that. I'm asking you, was it customary? Was this unusual for members of the firm to be talking to you about changing documents, altering documents, substituting documents that were on file already regards to Enron operations? 
MS. TEMPLE -- At the time, based on my recollection, I understood that there were good-faith questions that were being asked about how to properly document the firm's ---- 
MR. TAUZIN -- Was it a good-faith question to change a memo that's already in the file with a new memo? 
MS. TEMPLE -- I received the question and consulted with my supervisor and others -- -- 
MR. TAUZIN -- You said, don't do it. 
MS. TEMPLE -- ---- and gave the advice. And to the best of my knowledge, the advice was followed. 
MR. TAUZIN -- Were you shocked that they would raise such a question? Were you alarmed? Were you disturbed? Did it bother you, as litigation counsel for the firm, that any member would even suggest altering the record, altering documents, substituting memos to the file? 
MS. TEMPLE -- I don't recall everything going on in my mind. I recall making sure, giving advice to make sure that the written record was complete and accurate and truthful. And I do recall seeing that my advice was followed. 
MR. TAUZIN -- And my time is up, but you do recall also that Oct. 16 memo, that you did discuss with them changing that memo so that your name was not included because you might be a potential witness. Is that correct? 
MS. TEMPLE -- I do recall giving legal advice after consultation with others, including outside legal counsel, Davis Polk, that the audit partners should document the recommendations and communications he had with the client about the client's, Enron's, draft press release. 
And I did, after consulting with outside legal counsel, and it's our standard practice in the legal group to advise the engagement team not to write down and discuss in their memos legal advice that the legal group might give, because it might be a waiver down the road of attorney-client privilege. 
MR. TAUZIN -- Thank you, gentlelady. 
The chair recognizes the gentlelady, Ms. DeGette, for a round of questions. 
REPRESENTATIVE DEGETTE -- Thank you, Mr. Chairman. . . . 
If you can tell me very briefly, under what circumstances you believe documents should be retained? When is it, what is the trigger under which documents need to be retained? 
MS. TEMPLE -- There are several provisions in the policy that address retention. 
MS. DEGETTE -- And, in fact, there's an exhibit to document No. 27 here, Exhibit 1, that says examples of situations to be reported, and that's a list of examples of situations where, if you see that coming, then you treat that as threatened legal action under Section 2.5 of the litigation procedures and you retain them. Is that right? 
MS. TEMPLE -- Yes, there is a list of examples to be reported to the legal group that calls for notification. I don't believe ---- 
MS. DEGETTE -- And that would trigger, then, a notification such as the one that you made, I think, on Oct. 12 in your e-mail, right? 
MS. TEMPLE -- My understanding ---- 
MS. DEGETTE -- I mean, it's not just threatened litigation, is it? There's other things that would trigger Arthur Andersen to recommend retention of documents. 
MS. TEMPLE --The policy does require retention of all related material if there's threatened litigation. 
MS. DEGETTE -- Or other situations, right? And one of those situations would be oral indications from management or owners that the firm was somehow responsible for the failure of operations or the failure to detect fraud, right? That's the third one on the list of examples of situations to be reported, right? 
MS. TEMPLE -- Right. And this list of examples is from the policy statement No. 780, which ---- 
MS. DEGETTE -- Right. 
MS. TEMPLE -- ---- requires notification to the legal group of those examples. 
MS. DEGETTE -- -- O.K. So now, there was a memo that was written on Aug. 15, 2001, from Sherron Watkins, an Enron vice president, alleging improper accounting and all kinds of other problems. Was the legal department aware of that? 
MS. TEMPLE -- I don't recall if I was aware of that particular document. I was aware of circumstances about allegations by an employee of Enron, and the fact that Vinson & Elkins had conducted an investigation and concluded and reported positively to the board the week of Oct. 8. 
MS. DEGETTE -- So you were aware that in August an employee had made these allegations, and then Vinson & Elkins had done an investigation also in August. Is that right? 
MS. TEMPLE -- Not exactly. 
MS. DEGETTE -- No? 
MS. TEMPLE -- Before Oct. 12 I was aware that Vinson & Elkins had been engaged and completed and reported orally to the board that the results of their investigation were positive. 
And the engagement team also assured the practice directors who were being consulted at that time and myself that they had reviewed the information about the allegations, and that the allegations were, to the extent that they had any information in them in reference to transactions, involved transactions that the audit team had carefully reviewed in its prior work. 
MS. DEGETTE -- O.K. So you thought that, because Vinson & Elkins had said there's no problem, that that did not trigger any kind of requirement. Is that correct? Yes or no, please. 
MS. TEMPLE -- No, that's not ---- 
MS. DEGETTE -- O.K, thank you. 
MS. TEMPLE -- ---- what I was thinking at the time. 
MS. DEGETTE -- Now, what caused you to send that memo on Oct. 12? Did you do that on a regular basis? 
MS. TEMPLE -- There were several factors that caused me to send the memo on Oct. 12. 
MS. DEGETTE -- O.K, let me back up for a minute. How many times in your two years, roughly, at Andersen did you send memos like this, reminding people of the document retention and destruction policy? 
MS. TEMPLE -- I don't recall the number of times. I have referred ---- 
MS. DEGETTE -- Had you done it before? 
MS. TEMPLE -- I believe I had referred people to the firm's policies on document retention and destruction, as well as ---- 
MS. DEGETTE -- How many times before? 
MS. TEMPLE -- I don't recall the number of times. 
MS. DEGETTE -- One time? Five times? Ten times? 
MS. TEMPLE -- To the best of my recollection, at least one other occasion, and I ---- 
MS. DEGETTE -- And was that in relation to Enron, or was that in relation to another client? 
MS. TEMPLE -- No, that was not in relation to Enron. . . . 
MR. TAUZIN -- I just want to clarify your testimony to the gentlelady's questions. You indicated that Vinson & Elkins issued a positive report. I want a quote from that report. 
''There is a serious risk of adverse publicity and litigation. It also appears, because of the inquiries and issues raised by Ms. Watkins, Arthur Andersen will want additional assurances that Enron had no agreement with LJM that LJM would not lose money,'' et cetera. 
Is that a positive report? 
MS. TEMPLE -- As I recall, the outcome of the report, as reported to me, the ---- 
MR. TAUZIN -- You have a copy of this, I believe we've submitted, you have a copy of this letter, don't you, from Vinson & Elkins? You saw it yourself, didn't you? 
MS. TEMPLE -- After the week of Oct. 12, I did receive a copy ---- 
MR. TAUZIN -- But here's the point, Ms. Temple. I mean, we're trying to get the facts here. But if you will characterize a report that indicates a decline in the value of Enron's stock and the serious risk of adverse publicity and litigation as a positive report from the attorneys, we're going to have trouble with your testimony today. 
MS. TEMPLE -- Later on, when I did receive a copy of the report and sent a copy to outside counsel, I did note the comments that you referenced. But I also noted that the law firm reported that there was nothing further to follow up on at that point in time. 
And the law firm was representing Enron Corporation, not Arthur Andersen. And I understood and recall at the time thinking that there might be a challenge to the business judgment decisions of Enron to enter into certain transactions. 
MR. TAUZIN -- Did you know at the time that Vinson & Elkins had signed off on these agreements as a counsel for the firm? There may have been a conflict of interest in them commenting on them now? 
MS. TEMPLE -- I don't recall the circumstances ---- 
MR. TAUZIN -- You're not aware of that? 
MS. TEMPLE -- I don't recall at this time. 
MR. TAUZIN -- Thank you, gentlelady. 
MS. DEGETTE -- Do you recall a conversation with Mr. Duncan in which he assured you he was gathering the documents to preserve them? Do you recall specifically having that conversation? 
MS. TEMPLE -- I don't recall ---- 
MS. DEGETTE -- According to your notes? 
MS. TEMPLE -- ---- his specific words, but I do recall that we had a group conference call on Oct. 23. And I have these notes from that call. 
MS. DEGETTE -- And the notes don't say anything about preservation, do they? 
MS. TEMPLE -- The notes. . . . 
MS. DEGETTE -- Yes or no? 
MS. TEMPLE -- The notes do not have the word ''preservation'' in them. 
MS. DEGETTE -- And on Oct. 12, you had just sent a memo to Mr. Duncan and his group, advising them of the Arthur Andersen document retention and destruction policy, which involved destroying of all of the notes and backup documents and so on. Correct? 
MS. TEMPLE -- No. Actually, I sent a reference to the policy to the practice director in Houston. 
MS. DEGETTE -- So you never sent that to Mr. Duncan? 
MS. TEMPLE -- I did not send it personally to Mr. Duncan. 
MS. DEGETTE -- Mr. Odom had that, correct? Mr. Odom, did you have that? 
MS. TEMPLE -- Yes, I sent it to the Houston practice director, based on several factors ---- 
MS. DEGETTE -- Just cutting through, in this Oct. 23 phone call, you don't recall specifically -- and your notes do not reflect -- you telling Mr. Duncan to retain records, do they? Yes or no. 
MS. TEMPLE -- I don't see that in my ---- 
MS. DEGETTE -- Yes or no, ma'am? 
MS. TEMPLE -- No, it's not. . . . 
MS. DEGETTE -- Thank you. I yield back. 
MR. TAUZIN -- Ms. Temple, if you received this e-mail from Mr. Duncan indicating he was collecting all these documents, and assumed that he was preserving them, why did you feel it necessary on November the 9th to leave a voice mail with Mr. Duncan, directing him to preserve those documents because of the receipt of the S.E.C. subpoena? If he was preserving them already, why on earth did you feel it necessary to advise him to preserve them on Nov. 9? 
MS. TEMPLE -- It is our firm's practice to notify the engagement team when the legal group receives a subpoena. I believe it had been received in the general counsel's office, and I promptly notified the engagement partner and reminded about the need to, at this point in time, we'll have to collect the documents for production. 
MR. TAUZIN -- Well -- but you understand why common sense gets a little lost here. If you're in a position where you know that the retention policy also means destruction -- you know that, didn't you? 
MS. TEMPLE -- There are aspects of instruction guidelines ---- 
MR. TAUZIN: -- Yes. 
MS. TEMPLE -- ---- in that policy. Yes. 
MR. TAUZIN -- So you know that the retention policy, as long as it's operating, permits Mr. Duncan and however many people he has working for him to destroy documents. 
You hear, you get a memo from him saying, ''I'm gathering them all up.'' And you tell us today that you assumed that meant he was gathering up to preserve them for litigation, not to destroy them. 
Why would you even bother to say, ''By the way,'' on Nov. 9, ''quit destroying documents. We've just got an S.E.C. subpoena?'' Why would you do that? 
MS. TEMPLE -- The legal group notifies the engagement partner and engagement team when subpoenas are served. It was received by the legal group, and I felt it was appropriate to follow the firm protocol to notify the engagement partner. 
MR. TAUZIN -- Yes. But, you see, we also have your memo on November the 10th, and I'm going to read you from it. It says, ''One of the first things we must do in preparing to respond to these subpoenas and lawsuits is to take all necessary steps to preserve all of the documents and other materials that we may have relating to claims that are being filed.'' 
Now, if that was already being done, if you had received a notice from Mr. Duncan that he's gathering them all up to preserve them, if that was your conclusion, why would you say, ''the first thing we have to do now, now that the subpoena has arrived is start preserving these things?'' 
You see, common sense, Ms. Temple, common sense tells me that destruction was going on up until this time when the subpoena arrived and that until you said, ''preserve them'' they may well have been gathered up for destruction, and that somebody should have known that. And was that somebody you? 
MS. TEMPLE -- I never counseled any destruction or shredding of documents. And I only wish that someone had raised the question so that we could have consulted and addressed the situation.

Staff Saw Document Shredding at Enron --- Three Former Employees Say Destruction Took Place After Investigation Began
By Wall Street Journal staff reporters Tom Hamburger, John R. Emshwiller, Rebecca Smith and Jonathan Weil

Three former Enron Corp. employees say documents were shredded in the accounting department of the company's Houston headquarters after federal investigators had begun a probe into possible illegalities at the energy giant. 
In interviews with ABC World News Tonight and later with The Wall Street Journal, Maureen Castaneda, a former Enron executive whose office was right across from the accounting department on the 19th floor, said shredding of documents apparently continued through the middle of January, when she left the company. Separately, two other former Enron employees told the Journal they saw several trash bags full of shredded documents in the same area in November.
According to Ms. Castaneda and one of the other employees, the shredded documents appeared to relate to controversial partnerships used by Enron to hide debt and inflate its profits. Ms. Castaneda is in possession of shreds of Enron accounting documents marked "confidential" and dated December 2001. 
One of the shreds contained the word "Jedi," likely a reference to the Enron-controlled Joint Energy Development Investment partnership. Another shredded document seen by one of the two other employees contained the phrase "LJM $150 million." LJM is the name of two partnerships set up and run by former Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow. Ms. Castaneda -- who said she planned to use the shredded paper for packing material -- is a plaintiff in one of the dozens of employee and shareholder suits seeking class-action status against Enron. 
Last night, Enron counsel Robert S. Bennett issued a statement saying Enron is "investigating the circumstances of the reported destruction of documents. In October 2001 the company issued several directives to all Enron employees world-wide that all relevant documents should be preserved in light of pending litigation." 
"If anyone violated those directives," Mr. Bennett added, "they will be dealt with appropriately." 
Enron filed for bankruptcy-court protection on Dec. 2 following a loss of investor confidence after the company issued several restatements of earnings dating back to 1997 and disclosures about several questionable partnerships run by its top executives. 
The Securities and Exchange Commission began looking into possible violations of securities laws at Enron in late October. Around the same time, the company's legal department sent out a series of circulars demanding that employees safeguard all correspondence, written or electronic, related to the partnerships and other transactions. 
On Nov. 1, at least one of the memos was copied directly to David Duncan, the head of the Houston office of Enron's auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP. Mr. Duncan was dismissed by Andersen last week for having overseen the destruction of documents. Mr. Duncan, in turn, has told congressional investigators that he was trying to follow the advice of an attorney in Andersen's Chicago headquarters, Nancy Temple, who sent an Oct. 12 e-mail reminding Houston personnel of the firm's document-retention and -disposal policy. 
Mr. Duncan has told investigators that he didn't think there was anything wrong with destroying Andersen-owned documents because the SEC inquiry begun in late October concerned Enron, not Andersen. Andersen has said the shredding stopped on Nov. 9, Ms. Temple sent an e-mail message for Mr. Duncan telling him the SEC had issued a subpoena to Andersen, and that all Enron-related documents must be preserved. However, that doesn't explain why the shredding wasn't halted until eight days after Mr. Duncan apparently received the Enron memo saying documents should be safeguarded. 
But a person close to him said Mr. Duncan expected that Andersen's in-house counsel would tell him when and if documents in the accounting firm's possession needed to be preserved. "The first time he received such an instruction was Nov. 9," this person said, "and he immediately did so." 
Meanwhile, congressional investigators examining Enron's collapse met for four hours yesterday with Ms. Temple, the Andersen in-house counsel who left the voice-mail message for Mr. Duncan about preserving documents. She was asked about the reason for her reminders to Andersen employees about her firm's policy on retaining and destroying documents. According to people familiar with the questioning, Ms. Temple said yesterday that her reminders were simply routine restatements of Arthur Andersen policy and weren't intended as anything more. 
Ms. Temple is considered likely to be asked to appear at a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee hearing Thursday examining document destruction. Her attorney didn't return calls seeking comment. 
As for Mr. Duncan, his lawyer, Vince DiBlasi, said, "It is premature to require him to testify." But the chairman of the subcommittee, Republican Rep. Jim Greenwood of Pennsylvania, has said he would subpoena Mr. Duncan if necessary. 
Ms. Temple sent an Oct. 12 e-mail to Michael Odom, head of risk management for Arthur Andersen's Houston office, according to people with knowledge of Mr. Odom's interview with congressional investigators. He told them he forwarded it to Mr. Duncan, who oversaw the shredding of documents until Nov. 9 when Ms. Temple sent him a voice-mail message. 
In addition to those two communications, Ms. Temple sent out a terse reminder of the policy on Oct. 19 to John Stewart, Andersen's director of U.S. accounting standards, who holds a powerful regulatory position within the profession as a member of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Emerging Issues Task Force. The memo also went to Amy Ripepi, an Andersen executive who heads the SEC regulations committee for the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. 
This is the first indication that Andersen executives with leading regulatory positions in the accounting profession were issued reminders about the firm's document-retention and -destruction policies. 
An Andersen spokesman, Charlie Leonard, said he didn't know why Ms. Temple sent out the Oct. 19 memo. He said Mr. Duncan exercised "extremely bad judgment" by destroying documents related to Enron "with full knowledge of an SEC investigation."

Ex-Enron staffer details shredding
Firm ordered all data be kept 
By ROSANNA RUIZ and PATTY REINERT 
Copyright 2002 Houston Chronicle 

A former Enron Corp. executive said Monday she witnessed the mass shredding of financial documents at the energy company's accounting office, a practice that began around Thanksgiving and continued through at least last week. 
Maureen Castaneda, Enron's former director of foreign exchange, has turned over to a lawyer several boxes containing mounds of shredded documents dated from November and December. The shreds reveal words that refer to Enron's off-the-books business ventures, the partnerships that led to the company's collapse. 
In an ABC-TV interview that aired Monday night, Castaneda said that around Thanksgiving she saw several boxes of papers being pulled from storage areas and then shredded, despite a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation that had begun the month before. 
Castaneda said the shredding continued through her final day on the job last week and that she used paper-filled boxes she found in the hallway to pack her belongings. She could not be reached for comment by the Chronicle after the ABC broadcast. 
Enron spokesman Mark Palmer, however, said that company officials had directed employees when the SEC investigation began to retain all documents, to destroy nothing. 
"We don't know the significance nor the pertinence of the documents that the plaintiffs' lawyers are parading in front of the media," Palmer said Monday. 
"But we do know what we have been telling employees sinceOct. 25. We have told them repeatedly that they are to retain all documents or materials related to Enron transactions, statements to the public and investors, handwritten notes -- in short, any method of information recording." 
The company issued four directives via e-mail about the document retention, Palmer said. An Oct. 25 e-mail warned employees: "You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions." 
Bill Lerach, an attorney representing New York-based Amalgamated Bank in a lawsuit against Enron executives, said Monday he will seek a restraining order in federal court today to prevent the destruction of any other evidence. 
Amalgamated Bank, which manages pension funds that hold Enron stock, sued in November, alleging that Enron executives and board members sold $1.1 billion in Enron stock during the past three years while not disclosing that the stock price was overvalued. 
Lerach said that while he knows of several former Enron employees who saw the shredding, Castaneda was the only one who has come forward. 
"From what we have learned, destruction of evidence at Enron was open and notorious and widespread," Lerach said. "They even shredded on Christmas Day." 
He said he will have the shredded files in court today. 
"We believe the Enron employees were destroying documents at the same time Andersen people did," said Lerach, referring to Enron's former auditor. "The question of whether there was a coordinated effort is something to look into." 
In Washington, investigators pushed for public testimony from former Arthur Andersen auditor David Duncan, fired last week after the company said he ordered the destruction of Enron documents last fall. 
Duncan since has cooperated with investigators, telling them that Andersen executives had plenty of information to evaluate Enron's controversial use of offshore partnerships. 
The partnerships allowed Enron to hide millions of dollars of debt for years and mislead investors and its employees about Enron's financial health. 
Duncan "did not sit there and say, `Enron hid all this information from us and therefore we couldn't count right,' " Rep. Jim Greenwood, R-Pa., who heads the House Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, told The Associated Press. "It was more of ... `we made mistakes.'" 
Greenwood, speaking about comments Duncan made to lawmakers last week, said that rather than a mea culpa, Duncan gave "a wea culpa; he did not point the finger at Enron." 
Duncan is scheduled to testify before Greenwood's panel Thursday, one day after lawmakers return to Capitol Hill from their winter break. Duncan's lawyers had tried to delay his testimony, saying he needs more time to prepare, but Greenwood rejected the request, threatening to subpoena Duncan if necessary. 
Duncan "doesn't really need to recall every detail of what he did for Enron," Greenwood told the AP. "We're focused on the destruction of documents." 
Enron and Arthur Andersen have come under fire in the wake of the Houston company's implosion last year. Once the world's largest energy trading company, Enron filed for bankruptcy Dec. 2, costing thousands of employees their jobs and their retirement nest eggs, much of which were tied up in now virtually worthless company stock. 
At least nine congressional investigations are under way, as are probes by the Labor Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department, which is looking into possible criminal violations. 
In addition to the congressional investigations, lawmakers also will turn their attention to legislation aimed at preventing a another debacle like Enron. 
On Monday, Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., said she will introduce a bill this week ensuring that auditors remain independent from the companies they audit. 
The bill comes in the wake of revelations that Andersen received $52 million in annual business from Enron, about half of it from its auditing account and half in consulting fees. 
Joseph Berardino, chief executive officer of Andersen, has dismissed concerns that his company overlooked Enron's accounting practices to preserve other business with the company. 
However, appearing on NBC-TV's Meet the Press over the weekend, Berardino said Andersen is considering whether to end its consulting services and focus on its auditing business. 
Also on the congressional agenda in the coming months will be legislation that Boxer sponsored with Sen. Jon Corzine, D-N.J., to protect employee retirement accounts. 
The Boxer-Corzine Pension Protection and Diversification Act, introduced last month, encourages workers to diversify retirement investment plans by limiting to 20 percent the investment an employee can have in any one stock in his 401(k). 
The bill also would allow employees who receive their own company's stock as part of their employer's matching contribution to their retirement savings plan to sell the stock 90 days after it arrives in their accounts. 
In Enron's case, employees were not allowed to sell matching stock until age 50.

Second Executive Tells of Andersen E-mail --- Version of Events Bolsters Fired Auditor's Account Of Shredded Documents

WASHINGTON -- Bolstering the account of a fired Arthur Andersen LLP auditor, an executive in the accounting firm's Houston office told congressional investigators that an e-mail from headquarters reminding employees of Andersen's document-disposal policy was unprecedented, people familiar with his interview say. The Oct. 12 e-mail arrived shortly before Houston personnel began destroying papers relating to Enron Corp. 
The account by Michael Odom, the head of risk management for the Houston office, is consistent with that given to lawmakers by Enron's lead auditor, David Duncan, who Andersen fired last week for overseeing the document destruction. It also helps lawmakers to focus their probe on the role top Andersen officials played in the downfall of Enron, one of the nation's biggest companies until it filed for bankruptcy-court protection last month amid questions about its accounting practices.
The document destruction, which continued after the Securities and Exchange Commission began inquiries into Enron's financial statements in late October, will be the subject of a hearing by the House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing Thursday. Messrs. Duncan and Odom and the Andersen lawyer who sent the Oct. 12 e-mail likely will be invited to testify. 
Mr. Odom's lawyer, Peter Fleming, said his client is cooperating fully with investigators. "Mike Odom has done nothing wrong, and is unaware of any wrongdoing," Mr. Fleming said. Andersen has portrayed the shredding of documents as an isolated case of poor judgment and has disciplined several people in the Houston office, including Mr. Odom, who was stripped of his management responsibilities. 
Andersen Chief Executive Joseph Berardino said on NBC's "Meet the Press" yesterday that Mr. Duncan was fired after "he displayed extremely poor judgment in the destruction of documents issue." Mr. Berardino blamed Enron's demise on a failed business model, not accounting errors. "A company has failed and it has failed because the economics didn't work," he said. 
Mr. Duncan last week told congressional investigators that he ordered subordinates to begin destroying documents related to the Enron account after he received an e-mail from Nancy Temple, a senior lawyer in Andersen's Chicago office. The Oct. 12 e-mail -- sent to Mr. Odom, who passed it on to Mr. Duncan -- was a reminder of Andersen's longstanding document-retention and destruction policy, which called for the disposal of nonessential papers. 
Both Messrs. Odom and Duncan told congressional investigators that they had never before been sent such a reminder, according to people familiar with their interviews. Ms. Temple was a member of an "extended review team" of Houston and Chicago officials created to take a closer look at Enron as questions arose about its condition. Members of the team talked with each other several times a week, Mr. Odom told congressional investigators. 
Mr. Duncan told investigators he didn't think there was anything wrong with destroying Andersen-owned documents because the SEC inquiry begun in late October concerned Enron, not Andersen. The shredding stopped on Nov. 9 when Ms. Temple left a voice-mail message for Mr. Duncan telling him that the SEC had issued subpoenas and that all documents must be preserved. 
A person close to Mr. Duncan says he forwarded that voice mail to the entire Enron audit team and instructed his secretary to send an e-mail repeating the instruction. The next day, Ms. Temple reiterated the message in a follow-up e-mail to Mr. Duncan and others involved with the Enron account. 
The implication of the account offered by Mr. Duncan and bolstered by Mr. Odom is that the document destruction began only when the office was reminded of Andersen's document-destruction policy by Ms. Temple and stopped only when the office heard from her again about the subpoenas. 
But Andersen spokesman Charlie Leonard said Ms. Temple never instructed the Houston office to begin shredding Enron documents, nor did she intend to order them to stop the shredding, because she didn't know it was going on in the first place. The November messages from Ms. Temple constituted "an innocent and appropriate reminder from the legal department to the staff in Houston of what the procedures are when somebody receives a subpoena," he said. 
The finger-pointing over document destruction is part of a larger battle over responsibility for Enron's collapse. Evidence uncovered by lawmakers suggests the Enron account was watched closely by officials at Andersen's headquarters. 
For example, top Andersen officials have portrayed as routine a meeting convened on Feb. 5 to discuss whether to retain Enron as a client. Andersen's Mr. Berardino said yesterday it was "part of a normal process we go through every year" for all clients. But Mr. Duncan told investigators that he made a point of including top Andersen executives, including several via phone from Chicago, because he was concerned that the Enron account posed "significant risk," a person present when he was questioned said. 
An Andersen spokesman said he didn't know why particular executives were invited to the meeting and declined to say whether routine retention meetings normally include several top executives. Other evidence points to active involvement in the Enron account by top Andersen executives. Enron CEO Kenneth Lay told employees in an online exchange on Sept. 26 that financial transactions being questioned at the time had all been approved by Andersen -- "in many cases, not only" by Houston-based auditors but also by "Andersen's headquarters office from some of the world's leading experts in these types of financing," according to a transcript released by lawyers for Enron employees suing the company over stock losses in their retirement accounts.

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE OVERVIEW
EX-OFFICIAL SAYS ENRON EMPLOYEES SHREDDED PAPERS
By JONATHAN D. GLATER and MICHAEL BRICK

01/22/2002
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

Enron employees were shredding documents at the company's Houston offices as recently as last week, a former executive said yesterday. Her statement was the first indication that documents were destroyed at Enron amid investigations of the company's collapse by Congress and the Justice Department and followed reports of document shredding by accountants at Enron's auditor, Arthur Andersen. 
The company said last night that it was looking into the claims by the executive, Maureen Castaneda, who was Enron's director of foreign exchange and sovereign risk management. Enron said that it had repeatedly directed workers to preserve all documents once it learned in October that the Securities and Exchange Commission had begun an investigation of its accounting practices.
Lawmakers investigating Enron's collapse and former prosecutors said that evidence of document destruction would play a central role in Congressional and criminal inquiries into the company's fall. 
''If anyone in Enron, or for that matter Arthur Andersen, is shredding documents that have anything to do with this entire matter, they are going to be in a whole lot of trouble,'' said Representative James C. Greenwood, Republican of Pennsylvania, who is chairman of a House subcommittee that will hold a hearing Thursday into shredding by Andersen. Ms. Castaneda described the shredding by Enron employees on ABC News last night. 
As for Arthur Andersen, an internal document shows that as early as November 2000, the accounting firm had concluded that Enron's Internet services unit, which the company considered crucial to its growth, had such poor controls that there was a ''high risk'' that its financial results would be misrepresented. 
Andersen continued to sign off on the results, and the performance of the unit, Enron Broadband Services, rapidly deteriorated with the bursting of the Internet bubble. After losing $60 million in all of 2000, the unit reported losses of $494 million in the nine months that ended last Sept. 30. 
The stock market's decline as the air went out of the new-economy boom apparently also took a harsh toll on the finances of Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman. Though he received more than $200 million in compensation and profits from exercising Enron stock options over three years, Mr. Lay was forced to borrow millions more from the company last year to meet his obligations. 
In a telephone interview yesterday afternoon, Ms. Castaneda said that document shredding at Enron began before Christmas and continued through last week. 
Ms. Castaneda said that employees in Enron's accounting department, which had offices across the hall from her own on the 19th floor of an Enron office tower, collected about 15 boxes of documents after Thanksgiving. She watched as the department employees searched through the boxes, Ms. Castaneda said, and later noticed that shredded paper was accumulating in trash bins. 
''I can't tell you what they were searching for, but they were definitely interested in picking out certain documents,'' Ms. Castaneda said. 
Robert S. Bennett, a lawyer representing Enron, said that the company was investigating the reports of shredded documents. 
''In October 2001 the company issued several directives to all Enron employees worldwide that all relevant documents should be preserved in light of pending litigation,'' Mr. Bennett said. ''If anyone violated those directives, they will be dealt with appropriately.'' 
The company said that it had sent employees four e-mail messages on document retention since Oct. 25, most recently last Monday. 
Legal experts said it would be a crime deliberately to destroy documents that might be sought by the S.E.C. or other government agencies. 
''It is really dumb,'' said Michael J. Shepard, former chief of the special prosecutions division in the United States attorney's office in Chicago and now a partner at Heller Ehrman White & McAuliffe in San Francisco. Destroying documents makes it very difficult to argue that their content was not incriminating, he said. 
''Maybe,'' he said, ''the document says, 'Man, did we cheat, and the roof is about to fall in.' Maybe the document is really, really bad. But in a lot of cases, it can be better to have the documents because you can explain them.'' 
Another former Enron employee, who asked not to be identified, said yesterday that she witnessed two to five people shredding documents in a room in late November or early December. 
The former employee was unable to identify the people and said she had observed them only casually. She added that she was not aware of any orders not to shred documents but said that several Enron employees later indicated that they had also seen the shredding taking place. 
Ms. Castaneda said that she collected a box of shredded documents at the suggestion of G. Paul Howes, an investigator for the law firm of Milberg Weiss Hynes Bershad & Lerach, which has filed a suit against Enron and its officers and directors on behalf of investors. 
The shredded pages include accounting records, expense reimbursement requests, wire fund transfer requests and what appear to be insurance records. Some of them are dated after Enron said it sent out notices about preservation of documents, and some include the words ''post-petition,'' which Mr. Howes said suggested they were related to the company's bankruptcy filing. 
Some of the shredded strips have the names of secretive partnerships --JEDI II and Raptor -- that have been linked to transactions allowing Enron to keep some of its debt hidden from investors. 
Bill Lerach, a partner at Milberg Weiss, said last night that he planned to take the box of shredded documents before a judge in Houston today and ask that other Enron documents be taken into the custody of the court immediately. 
Congressional hearings begin on Thursday before both the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee and Mr. Greenwood's House Energy and Commerce subcommittee. The House hearing will focus on the admission last week by Andersen that employees in its Houston office destroyed thousands of Enron documents shortly after learning that the S.E.C. was investigating Enron. 
Last week, Andersen fired the lead partner on the Enron audits, David B. Duncan, saying that he orchestrated the shredding. Mr. Duncan has told investigators that he was following a directive from a lawyer in Andersen's home office in Chicago, Nancy Temple, who in an Oct. 12 e-mail message re-emphasized the firm's document-destruction policy. Mr. Duncan has told investigators that it was ''unusual'' for the firm to re-emphasize that policy, according to people close to the investigation. Officials with the House subcommittee said Ms. Temple was likely to testify Thursday. 
In his interview with investigators, Mr. Duncan also attributed some blame for accounting errors to himself, Mr. Greenwood said. Mr. Greenwood said his staff members had told him that ''the bottom line'' from Mr. Duncan's testimony was that ''he did not point the finger at Enron, and he did not claim that Enron hid information from him.'' 
''Our hearing will be focused on the destruction of documents,'' Mr. Greenwood said. ''Did Arthur Andersen destroy documents strictly pursuant to its normal protocol, or was there an aggressive attempt to destroy documents to cover up? These are the questions we need to get to in our hearing.'' 
The analysis by Andersen of Enron Broadband Services examined the company's efforts to limit the financial risk in 10 of the unit's business areas. The report found that half of the areas reviewed had inadequate financial control; the other half were rated ''satisfactory.'' None of the areas received the next highest rating, which was ''good.'' 
The Andersen report, in many passages, is critical of the Enron management's ability to keep track of the unit's financial commitments, saying that the company lacked many of the formal procedures that would allow its top officers to spot problems early. 
An Andersen spokesman declined to comment, saying he did not have a copy of the report. Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman, said that since Andersen served as the company's internal auditor, it was the accounting firm's responsibility to detect trouble spots in Enron's financial controls. 
''As part of that job, they would offer suggestions on how to fix any problems that they found,'' Mr. Palmer said. 
Even as the market for broadband capacity and services collapsed in 2000, Enron Broadband reported significant gains from equity investments in other companies, sales of fiber optic cable among a group of partnerships affiliated with Enron, and other transactions. 
But in November, when Enron restated its earnings going back to 1997, that performance proved illusory. The division's year-end loss of $60 million climbed to $357 million by the third quarter of 2001, according to S.E.C. filings. 
The Andersen analysis found that for its investments in projects involving large cash commitments in fixed assets, like a fiber optic network, Enron Broadband's ''current conditions indicate informal processes, lack of overall communication and coordination and monitoring controls.'' 
Andersen, which rated the controls for capital projects as ''inadequate,'' wrote that there was no formal policy at the company for approving such investments, and that there was no management process in place to track the status of projects after they began. 
The Andersen report also found controls in numerous other areas inadequate. It cited deficiencies that prevented the company from identifying and disposing of obsolete inventory. It also found that the company historically bought services without proper authorizations or documentation. All told, the report says, the division had no formal procurement policy. 
Even in the areas where the financial controls were rated as ''satisfactory,'' shortcomings were found, according to the Andersen report. 
In the division's merchant investing business, the report said that Enron executives responsible for placing a value on possible investments were not always consulted before a decision was made to commit the company's money. 
Moreover, the report said, policies to prevent employees from profiting on their knowledge of the division's decisions were inadequate. 
The report contains a long list of ''management action plans'' to address the problems. But the plans, all of which are labeled ''tentative and preliminary,'' failed to impose the controls that the division needed, former executives said.

THE ENRON INQUIRY Former Exec Says Enron Destroyed Documents
MEGAN GARVEY; LEE ROMNEY
TIMES STAFF WRITERS

HOUSTON -- Enron Corp. shredded documents after the company came under federal investigation, attorneys for shareholders said Monday, and the energy company said it would review the allegations. 
The claim that shredding took place in Enron's accounting offices was made Monday by a former Enron executive who was laid off from the company this month.
The executive, Maureen Castaneda, collected a box of shreddings and will be a witness for plaintiffs suing over stock losses in the Enron collapse, said attorney William Lerach, who represents a group of shareholders. 
"Not just one document was destroyed, but it looks like hundreds of thousands were destroyed." 
Lerach said he intended to raise the issue at a federal court hearing here today. 
Castaneda, a director in Enron's foreign investments section, said in an interview with ABC News that she witnessed the shredding of documents that began around Thanksgiving and continued at least until she left the company in the second week of this month. 
Enron's accounting firm, Andersen, previously acknowledged that thousands of documents related to Enron were shredded by its Houston office. But Castaneda is the first to say publicly that Enron destroyed relevant papers. 
Paul Howes, an attorney working with Lerach, said text was legible in some of the shredded documents and included references to controversial partnerships such as Jedi II and Chewco. Losses by such off-the-book partnerships played a key role in triggering Enron's collapse. 
Based on statements from witnesses, Lerach estimated that possibly hundreds of thousands of documents were destroyed. 
"We are investigating the circumstances of the reported destruction of documents," Robert Bennett, a Washington attorney who is representing Enron, said in a statement issued late Monday. 
Bennett said Enron had issued "several directives" in October to all employees saying that "all relevant documents should be preserved in light of pending litigation." 
"If anyone violated those directives," Bennett said, "they will be dealt with appropriately." 
Ken Johnson, a spokesman for the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said congressional investigators will look into the allegations. 
"This whole sorry affair keeps getting uglier by the minute," he said. "It's one thing to make bad business decisions. It's something else entirely to try to cover up bad business decisions." 
Howes said fired Enron employees were told to gather their work papers in boxes and turn them over to company officials, who went through them and shredded numerous documents. 
He said the shredding began with the layoffs triggered by Enron's Dec. 2 declaration of bankruptcy, and accelerated during the Christmas and New Year's holidays. He said the shredded documents were dated from at least 1994 through Dec. 20, 2001. 
Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said the company does not "have any knowledge of the material that the plaintiffs' attorneys are parading in front of the media." But he said that if the allegations prove true, the people responsible will be fired. 
The company sent e-mails to employees on Oct. 25, Oct. 26, Oct. 31 and Jan. 14 instructing them to retain all documents dealing with "related-party transactions, SEC requests, or any Enron transactions or accounting for those transactions," he said. 
The January e-mail was sent as a reminder after it was revealed that Andersen had shredded Enron-related documents. 
"These e-mails were very specific that employees who did not follow these procedures were liable for civil or criminal penalties," Palmer said. 
Palmer confirmed that Castaneda was an employee at Enron who left the company in a recent round of layoffs. 
She was director of "foreign exchange and sovereign risk," analyzing currency exchange rates and the possibility that companies outside the U.S. would nationalize assets. 
Phil Schiliro, chief of staff to Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), a senior Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said that if documents were destroyed, it "raises the real possibility of obstruction of justice. We need to know if Enron is destroying documents, and if they are, learn what Enron is trying to hide." 
Though many companies routinely shred old or sensitive documents, business experts expressed surprise Monday that Enron might have destroyed key records, particularly after the company became the target of numerous lawsuits and government investigations. 
On Oct. 22, the company disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission had launched a preliminary inquiry into some of the company's partnerships. 
"Under the circumstances, this could be a very serious issue," said Nicholas Economides, business professor at New York University's Leonard N. Stern School of Business. 
"'When someone destroys documents, people start wondering what was in those documents," Economides said. "Even if they didn't say something horrible, a bad impression remains. And at Enron, there's no justification. Certainly no one could say they destroyed documents because they thought they were unimportant." 
Former employees reacted with concern and anger to the new charges. 
"It does take it to a new level," said Maritta Mullet, 58, a 10-year employee who lost nearly half a million dollars in would-be retirement benefit when the company crashed. "It's criminal. You just don't destroy evidence." 
The accusations of document shredding at Enron came as congressional investigators continued preparations for a hearing scheduled Thursday into the destruction of thousands of documents by Chicago-based Andersen. 
Congressional investigators said they will issue subpoenas today for key witnesses who fail to commit to testifying at Thursday's hearing. 
The House Energy and Commerce investigations subcommittee turned down an appeal Monday from David B. Duncan for more time to prepare. Duncan was Andersen's lead partner on the Enron account until he was fired last week for allegedly destroying documents. Duncan maintains he was following company orders. 
"Apparently [Duncan] would like to have more time to refresh his memory about events," said Johnson, who works for committee Chairman Rep. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.). 
"The bottom line is he will agree to testify by [today] or he will be subpoenaed," Johnson said. "All the witnesses have been put on notice that they are expected to appear and will face contempt-of-Congress charges and criminal penalties if they do not." 
In a letter to the committee Monday, Duncan's attorney, Robert Giuffra, said it is premature to require his client's testimony. Giuffra said Duncan wants to review boxes of documents that Andersen gave the committee but has not yet shared with him. 
At issue is Andersen's destruction of documents relating to Enron, shredding that took place even after the accounting firm was aware that the SEC was looking into the company's collapse. 
In firing Duncan, Joseph F. Berardino, Andersen's managing partner and chief executive, asserted that the 42-year-old executive had organized the destruction of records. The firm, he said, would not tolerate "unethical behavior, gross errors in judgment or willful violation of our policies." 
In private interviews with congressional staffers last week, Duncan and another Andersen official, Michael C. Odom, indicated that others at the accounting firm were "at the table" when the memo regarding the destruction of material was discussed, one congressional investigator said Monday. 
Andersen attorney Nancy Temple sent a memo Oct. 12 reminding employees of the company's long-standing policy to get rid of nonessential documents. 
"Duncan and Odom said there were other partners and managers at the table when the retention policy was handed out," said an investigator, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "Employees were told to do no less or no more than the policy called for." 
A month later, and nearly three weeks after Enron disclosed it was the subject of an SEC probe, Temple wrote another memo instructing company employees to preserve Enron documents. As of late Monday, she was the only one of four Andersen executives summoned who has told investigators she will appear on Capitol Hill for the Thursday hearing. 
The inquiry has been called to investigate who was involved in the destruction of evidence, which documents were destroyed and why. 
Odom, who was in charge of risk management at Andersen's Houston office, was told Monday that he would be called to testify. The subcommittee also has summoned Berardino, who has been given the option of sending a proxy and who is familiar with his company's internal investigation into the document destruction. 
In an appearance over the weekend on NBC's "Meet the Press," Berardino did not indicate his plans for the hearing. 
Enron's bankruptcy is widely considered to have the potential to become a political scandal because of the donations--almost $6 million over the last decade--to both parties from the company's officers, directors, employees and political action committee. Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive, was one of President Bush's top donors. 
A number of legislative efforts have been proposed to prevent a reoccurrence of Enron's unraveling. 
Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) said Monday that she plans to introduce a bill this week that would prohibit accounting firms from also serving as consultants for the companies they are auditing. 
The practice, which in the case of Enron allowed Andersen to earn more in consulting fees than from actual audit charges, has been widely derided in the wake of the bankruptcy as a clear-cut conflict of interest.

The Nation Enron's Lay Met With Executive on 'Improprieties,' Lawyer Says Accounting: Sherron Watkins was said to be assured the board was studying the matter. No findings were issued.

HOUSTON -- Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth L. Lay held several meetings in late October with a vice president who had urged him to clean up a series of "improprieties," her lawyer said in an interview Saturday. 
Lay first met with Sherron S. Watkins, Enron's vice president for corporate development, for half an hour Aug. 22, shortly after she wrote him an anonymous letter detailing her fears that the energy company would "implode in a wave of accounting scandals." But Philip Hilder, Watkins' lawyer, said "there were also subsequent meetings in October."
At one of the meetings, Lay told Watkins that the Enron board had formed a committee to look into the accounting issues, Hilder said. But he declined to provide further details of the meetings, which have not been previously reported. 
By October, the energy company was indeed beginning to implode. On Oct. 16, Enron announced an unexpected charge against earnings of more than $1 billion. On Oct. 22, the Securities and Exchange Commission began an inquiry. On Oct. 24, Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow took a leave of absence. On Oct. 31, the board announced the formation of the special committee, which has not yet issued any findings. 
An Enron spokeswoman said Saturday that she had no details about the Lay-Watkins meetings in October. 
Hilder also provided a better timeline for how the 42-year-old Watkins discovered and acted on the accounting irregularities, which involved so-called special purpose entities, some of which were based in the Cayman Islands, a haven for tax shelters. 
An eight-year veteran of Enron, Watkins had spent less than two months working for Fastow when, in the course of reviewing which assets could be sold, she "stumbled across" details on the entities, Hilder said. 
"The numbers just didn't add up," Hilder said. 
He said Watkins didn't confront Fastow. "She felt he knew what was going on and, if she confronted him with it, that would have been the end of her at Enron," the lawyer said. 
When Enron Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling resigned Aug. 14 after only six months on the job, Watkins had her opening. Skilling's abrupt departure for "personal reasons" stunned the company, and Lay scheduled an Aug. 16 meeting at the Hyatt Regency here for all concerned employees. He invited them to submit questions in advance--anonymously, if they wished. 
Watkins wrote a one-page letter, saying, "Skilling's abrupt departure will raise suspicions of accounting improprieties and valuation issues . . . . I am incredibly nervous." 
The meeting with employees didn't produce the resolution Watkins wanted, Hilder said, so her next step was to call a friend at Andersen, Enron's accounting firm. "She went to him as a sounding board," Hilder said. "Here she feels she is hanging out all alone. These deals must have been looked at by the accountants, maybe the lawyers, the top company brass. She had some doubt that maybe she had gotten it wrong." 
Watkins ultimately sought and was granted an Aug. 22 meeting with Lay, at which she gave him a six-page memo that detailed her questions and talked generally about the high level of employee worry. "I wish we would get caught," she quoted one Enron manager as saying in the memo. "We're such a crooked company." 
Lay later asked Vinson & Elkins, Enron's principal outside law firm, to conduct the review. Watkins had urged him not to hire that firm, saying Vinson & Elkins had a conflict because they had provided opinions on some of the deals. 
By the beginning of September, Watkins had transferred out of Fastow's office. On Oct. 15, Vinson & Elkins issued its report, which basically gave the special partnerships a clean bill of health. 
Watkins' reaction to the report, the lawyer said, "is probably pretty obvious, given her feelings about them looking into the matter . . . ."

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE ANGER
Enron Fired Workers for Complaining Online
By ALEX BERENSON

c. 2002 New York Times Company

The Enron Corporation fired at least two employees in the last two months for posting information or negative opinions about it on Internet message boards. 
One of the fired employees, Clayton Vernon, had asked Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman, during an earlier internal online discussion whether Enron had used aggressive accounting to overstate its profits. It is unclear whether Mr. Vernon's question to Mr. Lay, which came in September, two months before he was dismissed, played any role in his firing. But a coarsely worded message critical of Mr. Lay that Mr. Vernon posted in November under a screen alias was traced back to him in less than a day.
The second fired employee, according to Enron, was the person who revealed in early December on the Internet that Enron had paid $55 million in retention bonuses to top managers and executives just before it filed for bankruptcy protection and laid off 4,000 workers on Dec. 2. The bonuses were sharply criticized by Enron employees, many of whom had their retirement savings wiped out by Enron's collapse. Enron declined to identify the second fired employee. 
Enron also declined to comment on any other details of the two firings, and it would not say whether it had dismissed any other employees because of Internet postings. Mr. Vernon confirmed that he had been fired for postings that the company viewed as offensive. 
''We're not going to discuss internal security actions,'' said Mark Palmer, a spokesman for Enron. ''But we will say that we will protect very vigorously the corporation's property.'' 
Both firings involved material posted in an online forum about Enron on Yahoo, whose message boards are among the most heavily used on the Internet. 
It was not clear how Enron identified the employees behind the postings. People who post messages on Yahoo often believe that they cannot be traced if they do not use their real names. But many companies have the technical means to track the online activities of employees who use company computers and servers. 
In addition, Yahoo's privacy policy allows it to disclose personal information about people who post messages that it deems abusive or ''invasive of another's privacy, hateful, or racially, ethnically or otherwise objectionable,'' or that reveals confidential corporate data. 
Even so, a Yahoo spokeswoman said Yahoo had not given Enron any information about anyone who posted a message. Despite the disclaimer in its privacy policy, she said, Yahoo generally divulges personal information about users only in response to a court order. 
In any case, Enron apparently had little difficulty finding Mr. Vernon, who posted most of his messages from the company's Houston headquarters, where he worked designing computer-based models to estimate the value of Enron's energy trades. 
A native of Midland, Tex., who describes himself as a political progressive, Mr. Vernon said that when he joined Enron in December 1999, he hoped that the company would be diverse and a meritocracy. 
But in the course of two years working at Enron, he said, he ''realized it was just another Houston, Texas, corrupt thing -- that we grow in this town -- where the rich white Republicans think they can write any law they want to at any time.'' 
His frustration grew, he said, when Mr. Lay took part in an online chat within the company on Sept. 26 and brushed off Mr. Vernon's question about the way Enron had accounted for deals it had made with supposedly independent partnerships. Enron began to collapse after it became known in November that it had used the partnerships to overstate earnings by at least $600 million. 
By mid-November, with Enron's stock plunging, Mr. Vernon had begun to post dozens of messages a day on the Yahoo discussion board under the screen name ''utlonghornsrule,'' referring to the University of Texas, where he received a master's degree in economics. 
His messages warned investors away from Enron's stock, and many sharply criticized Enron and Mr. Lay. ''We were just sitting there with nothing to do,'' Mr. Vernon said of the period when he posted the messages. ''We were just sitting there watching our stocks go down.'' 
The final straw for him came Nov. 19, he said, when Enron canceled its Christmas party. At 5:16 p.m. that day, in a (not always grammatical) message sprinkled with vulgarities, Mr. Vernon wrote that Mr. Lay had ''just cancelled the Enron christmas party so he wouldn't have to show up for his own party with armed bodyguards.'' 
He went on, ''Lied and said employees were ambivalent. Trust me, nobody believes a word'' that Mr. Lay says, the posting said, using a vulgar epithet. ''People have enjoyed the company spending a few dollars on them and giving them a chance to laugh and dance a bit. Esp since most of us adore our coworkers. 
''Ken Lay is the sorriest sack of garbage I have ever been associated with, a truly evil and satanic figure.'' 
Other people quickly posted responses defending Mr. Lay, including one who wrote, ''1) You are an embarrassment to UT -- so shut up. 2) You don't know what you are talking about -- You don't run with the big dogs.'' Mr. Vernon said the style of that note led him to think that it was the work of a senior Enron employee. 
It did not take long for Enron to find out the identity of ''utlonghornsrule.'' The day after his vituperative posting, Mr. Vernon said, he was called into a meeting with his manager and a top human resources officer. ''My boss said, 'What were you doing?' and I said, 'I was frustrated,' '' Mr. Vernon said. ''They escorted me out immediately.'' He said he had been paid his salary, but no severance pay. 
Mr. Vernon said he understood why he was fired. ''I was using their equipment,'' he said, ''I was in their building, and it was a flagrant violation of company policy to do what I did. I'm not going to litigate it. I don't think it was unfair.'' 
He does not see himself as a whistle-blower, he said, and he is embarrassed by the language his anger led him to use -- but he is still angry.

Murky Waters: A Primer on Enron Partnerships --- As Details Surface, They Appear Central In Firm's Collapse
By John R. Emshwiller and Rebecca Smith
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

With names such as Marlin and Rawhide, Braveheart and Raptor, they sound like fancy bar drinks or maybe top-secret military missions. 
They are, in fact, a few of the myriad entities that Enron Corp. helped set up over the past decade and that now find themselves at the heart of one of the biggest corporate scandals in history. Government investigators are still sifting through the complex financial structures of these partnerships, limited-liability companies and other affiliates -- domestic and foreign -- trying to determine what, if any, accounting rules and laws may have been violated.
At this stage, many details remain murky. But one thing is certain: The partnerships -- which Enron often told investors little or nothing about -- hid hundreds of millions of dollars of losses and debt from public view. As information about the partnerships began surfacing, they were a major factor in the company's filing for bankruptcy-court protection in December. 
Here is a primer on what is known so far: 

Q: Why did Enron create the limited partnerships and related entities? 
A: Several reasons. By setting up partnerships, partly owned by the company, Enron could draw in capital from outside investors, such as banks, insurance companies, pension funds and even wealthy individuals. If structured properly, including at least 3% of their equity obtained from outside investors, the partnerships could also be kept separate from Enron. As a result, any debt incurred by the partnership could be kept off the company's balance sheet. This was an important consideration for a fast-growing energy-trading company that feared too much debt would damage its credit rating. Another, more personal incentive arose over time as Enron executives headed and partly owned some of the partnerships, which provided a lucrative source of outside income for those involved. For instance, Enron has said that its former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, made more than $30 million from two partnerships that he ran. 

Q: How many partnerships were there? 
A: Many hundreds, and perhaps even thousands, though the exact number isn't known. In all, Enron had about 3,500 subsidiaries and affiliates, many of them limited partnerships and limited-liability companies, which are a sort of hybrid between corporations and partnerships. Many of the limited partnerships were of the plain-vanilla variety and very much like those set up by other energy companies as a way to spread their risk. In the partnerships' simplest form, Enron and outside partners would each put up money to invest in specific projects, such as a pipeline or power plant, and then split any profits when the partnership ended. It isn't clear how many of these partnerships made money and how many didn't. 

Q: Were there partnerships that were more complicated? 
A: Yes, and increasingly so as time went on. In some of these partnerships, Enron parked assets that were troubled and falling in value, such as certain overseas energy facilities or stock in companies that had been spun off to the public by Enron. Putting the assets in the partnerships hid losses that Enron otherwise would have had to report. But there was a price to pay for this. Enron in some cases promised to compensate partnership investors down the road, often by issuing them Enron stock. As the value of the assets in the partnerships fell, the burden of meeting these down-the-road obligations became ever larger. Compounding the problem, Enron's stock price was falling as part of the broad stock-market retreat over much of last year. 
Conversely, some of the partnerships were used to produce large bursts of earnings for Enron through the use of complex financial transactions. In one case, involving the partnership Braveheart, Enron booked more than $100 million of income over a six-month period from a venture that never really got off the ground; Braveheart was part of a plan to deliver movies to homes over Enron's high-speed fiber-optic network, but the venture was in its infancy and never made it beyond the test phase. Enron later had to remove those earnings from income. Recently, Enron has had to take hundreds of millions of dollars in charges to earnings from other partnerships that it had previously been adding to the company's reported income. 

Q: So were these the partnership problems that helped sink Enron? 
A: Eventually. But the crisis was triggered by disclosures concerning three outside partnerships that were run and partly owned by Enron executives. The three were Chewco Investments LP, LJM Cayman LP and LJM2 Co-Investment LP. The last two were started in 1999 and run by Mr. Fastow, who was Enron's CFO until last October. 

Q: What are the concerns over partnerships run by executives? 
A: Conflict of interest is the biggest worry. The partnerships did hundreds of millions of dollars of transactions with Enron itself, in some cases buying assets from the company or selling assets to it. The problem is this: Where do the executives' loyalties lie? Are they trying to negotiate the best deal for the company that employs them and the shareholders who own the company, or the best deal for the partnership where they have an ownership stake? 

Q: Why would Enron's board of directors allow such a situation to occur? 
A: The reason the company and its board gave for approving these executive-run partnerships was speed. By having people intimately familiar with Enron's complex operations run the partnerships, the entities supposedly could make much quicker decisions about whether to take part in a particular transaction. This nimbleness, it was argued, could benefit both the company and the partnerships. To protect itself in dealings with these partnerships, the company says that it set up safeguards that required top company officers and the board to review and approve deals between Enron and the partnerships. 

Q: Did the safeguards work? 
A: In the end, certainly not for Enron shareholders. There are also some questions as to whether the executive-run partnerships received favored treatment. For example, internal documents from the LJM2 partnership indicate that on at least one occasion, the partnership renegotiated a deal that saved it millions of dollars, seemingly at Enron's expense. Like others, these executive-run partnerships were used to keep debt and losing ventures off Enron's books. Yet an even bigger problem these particular partnerships posed for Enron was one of perception. Critics say they seem to be evidence of a company that tolerated self-dealing by its own executives. When public attention started focusing on these partnerships in October, it opened the doors to concerns about a raft of problems facing Enron that were buried in its complex web of partnerships. With all this attention, investor confidence in Enron collapsed like a sandcastle at floodtide, and by December the company found itself forced to file for bankruptcy-court protection. 

Q: Had Enron been keeping these partnerships secret? 
A: There is scant, if any, public information on many of the hundreds, or even thousands, of Enron-related financial entities. And even in cases where there was disclosure, the details were often limited and some of the disclosure came belatedly. Chewco, for instance, was created in 1997 but didn't show up in any Enron Securities and Exchange Commission filings until last November. At that time, the company revealed that it had improperly accounted for dealings with the partnership and, as a result, was lopping off nearly $400 million, or more than 10%, from its reported earnings for the prior four years. Enron said Chewco and a related partnership shouldn't have been treated as separate entities and therefore couldn't have been engaged in third-party deals with the company. Because the LJM partnerships were run by a senior-enough Enron executive, the CFO, the company dutifully noted their existence in SEC filings over the past two-plus years. But the company's descriptions of the partnership dealings were so complicated as to be practically indecipherable. 

Q: So, should people in a position to know have called attention to the potential problems posed by the partnerships? 
A: Yes, any number could have and should have, critics say. Arthur Andersen, as Enron's accounting firm from 1985 forward, was intimately involved in the company's financial strategy. As auditor, it was entrusted to make sure Enron's reports were free of material misstatements, according to accounting standards, and fairly represented the company's financial condition. But Andersen itself was potentially conflicted since it operated as inside accountant, outside auditor and consultant to Enron, reaping tens of millions of dollars a year in fees. 
Enron's outside lawyers, led by the Houston firm Vinson & Elkins, reviewed many deals that now look suspect. The SEC was supposed to review Enron's financial statements. But the SEC's former chief accountant Lynn Turner said last week that the agency was so busy reviewing the flood of initial public offerings from new companies in the 1990s that it didn't have the resources to fully scrutinize more-established companies. And in a 1994 decision, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said it didn't have the obligation or authority to review wholesale energy-trading operations like the one run by Enron. 
As FERC Commissioner Nora Brownell said recently, "Everyone who has touched Enron should be looking in the mirror." 
--- The Art of the Enron Deal

Enron used outside partnerships to monetize assets and move debt off
its balance sheet. But the company at times was deeply involved in
funding the partnerships. Here is how such transactions in recent
years were typically structured:

1. Enron transfers asset to special-purpose entity, or partnership,
to move the asset and debt off its balance sheet and to recognize a
gain from the transfer.

2. Outside investor injects at least 3% of partnership's capital.
Under Financial Accounting Standards Board rules, a 3% outside
investment allows Enron not to classify the partnership as a
subsidiary.

3. In some cases it appears Enron helped provide some or all of the
3% of capital injected by the outside investor.

4. Banks typically loan up to 97% of capital needed by the
partnership. The partnership is expected to repay the loan from cash
generated by the Enron assets it acquires or through the sale of
assets upon liquidation of the partnership.

5. Enron guarantees bank loan, in some cases with Enron shares or a
pledge to make up any shortfall. As the company's fortunes declined
last year, these guarantees were sometimes in the form of cash.

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: MARKET PLACE
For Chief, $200 Million Wasn't Quite Enough Cash
By FLOYD NORRIS

01/22/2002
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 2
c. 2002 New York Times Company

Over three years starting in 1999, Kenneth L. Lay has reported receiving more than $200 million either from Enron directly or through exercising stock options. Yet, his lawyer now says, he was forced to borrow millions more from the company last year to meet his obligations. 
The disclosure of Mr. Lay's financial problems, made by Earl Silbert, his personal lawyer, was aimed at countering the impression that Mr. Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive, might have disposed of Enron stock in late August because he feared a collapse of the company.
Instead, the new information could leave an impression that his personal investments produced very large losses that he was unable to support despite his large income from Enron. 
Assuming that Mr. Silbert is correct, Mr. Lay joins a short list of chief executives whose pay in the 1990's was astronomical, and who ended up with severe financial problems because they borrowed too heavily against assets whose high value proved to be temporary. The others known to have such problems are Bernard J. Ebbers, the chief executive of WorldCom, whose margin loans were guaranteed by the company and whose shares are now worth less than he owes, and Steven Hilbert, the former chief executive of Conseco, who bought Conseco shares with money borrowed from the company before the stock price collapsed and he was fired. 
Mr. Lay appears to have parlayed his paper gains in Enron to buy other securities that also declined in value. His known investments, which are no doubt only a fraction of the actual investments, were concentrated in areas that did well when the stock market was soaring and have since suffered. They include stakes in Compaq Computer, i2 Technologies and NewPower Holdings. 
In fact, Mr. Silbert indicated that Mr. Lay first repaid a company loan with stock last February. Enron was then selling for more than $68 a share, so it appears that the sale was forced by the declining value of Mr. Lay's other investments. 
Just how much Mr. Lay is now worth is unclear. Nor is it clear how much, if any, money he still owes, or just what expenditures would have caused him to go through so much money so quickly. But his stake in Enron, which consists mostly of stock options, is now worthless after the collapse of the company. 
Mr. Lay had a $4 million revolving line of credit from Enron, which Mr. Silbert said was raised to $7.5 million at some point in 2001. He said that Mr. Lay took out money from that loan, and then repaid it, on 15 separate occasions from February through October. 
In each case, he repaid it by turning over stock to Enron. He appears to have obtained some of those shares by exercising options, while in other cases he returned shares he already owned. Mr. Silbert said Mr. Lay took out the loans from the company when he expected that he was likely to face margin calls from other lenders. 
If those 15 repayments averaged $4 million, then they totaled $60 million, which would represent the value of stock he returned to the company. Mr. Silbert declined to give exact figures, and formal disclosure of the transactions is not required by Securities and Exchange Commission rules until Feb. 14. 
From 1999 through 2001, Mr. Lay received salary and cash bonuses from Enron totaling more than $17.1 million. That figure does not include a salary for 2001, although he was supposed to earn $1.3 million. Presumably, it was paid until the company filed for bankruptcy on Dec. 3. 
But he brought in far more from cashing in his stock and options in the company. In 1999, Enron filings show, he realized $43.8 million from cashing in stock options. The next year, he realized $123.4 million from that source. And his filings show that he earned a profit of $20.7 million from cashing in options and selling stock in the first seven months of 2001. 
All told, that amounts to about $205 million over those three years. But that was not enough. According to Mr. Silbert, the loan proceeds from the company were needed when other loans needed to be paid. 
Mr. Lay has also sought to raise cash from other sources. Late last year Mr. Lay put up for sale several houses and properties he owns in Aspen, Colo. 
Functionally, disposing of stock by using it to pay off loans is the same as selling the stock. But legally it differs in two ways, although it is not clear which, if either, was important to Mr. Lay. 
The first is that while normal sales of stock by a top corporate official must be disclosed quickly, within 10 days of the month in which the sale was made, the return of stock to a company to repay a loan need not be disclosed until the next year. 
The second concerns the sanctions against insider trading. In general, an executive is barred from buying or selling his company's stock when he has material nonpublic information. But transactions are not barred if the entity on the other side of the trade has the same information. 
''If he is selling it back to the company, the company may have the same information he had,'' said Jack Coffee, a securities law professor at Columbia. He said that while a prosecutor could argue that the board did not have the information, and therefore the company did not have it, it would be a difficult case to prove. 
There is one other exception to insider trading rules, stemming from a rule issued by the S.E.C. in 2000. An executive may adopt a plan to sell stock regularly and then sell stock pursuant to it even after learning of material nonpublic information. But no such plan can be filed by an executive after he or she obtains such information, unless the information is made public. 
Mr. Lay took advantage of that rule repeatedly in 2001, filing plans to sell stock for three-month periods. His last plan expired at the end of July, by which time he had taken in $29.9 million from selling shares and earned a profit of $20.7 million. The share price had fallen to $45.35 by the end of the month. 
After that, Mr. Lay did not file a new plan and has not reported selling any additional shares in public markets. ''The reason he stopped selling was that he thought the stock was going to go up,'' a lawyer for Enron, Robert S. Bennett, said last week. 
After July 31, there was no shortage of news affecting Enron. On Aug. 14, Jeffrey Skilling resigned as Enron's president and chief executive, leading to Mr. Lay's reassuming the chief executive title he had surrendered earlier in the year. The next day, Sherron S. Watkins, an Enron employee, wrote to Mr. Lay of her concerns about the company's accounting, expressing the prescient fear that ''we will implode in a wave of accounting scandals.'' 
In October, the last month that Mr. Silbert said Mr. Lay repaid a company loan by turning in stock, Enron's report on third-quarter results set off an avalanche of bad publicity that led to the company's unraveling over the next month. The S.E.C. inquiry also began in October. 
By repeatedly borrowing from Enron, and then turning in stock to repay the loan, Mr. Lay was taking out cash directly from the company when the company's need for cash was growing. 
Had he exercised options and sold the stock to the public as he sought to pay his debts, Enron would have gained cash that now could be used to pay creditors. As it is, there is less cash available for that.

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: TRANSACTIONS AT ISSUE
ENRON CHIEF SAYS HIS SALE OF STOCK WAS TO PAY LOANS
By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

01/21/2002
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

WASHINGTON, Jan. 20 -- Kenneth L. Lay, the chairman and chief executive of the Enron Corporation, repeatedly used millions of dollars in Enron stock to repay loans made to him by the company last year as Enron shares declined in value, his lawyer said today. 
The lawyer, Earl J. Silbert, said in a telephone interview that Mr. Lay had put up shares of his Enron stock as collateral for other investments, which he said he could not identify. As the value of Enron stock plummeted last year, he said, Mr. Lay anticipated that lenders would demand additional collateral.
So Mr. Lay's decision to dispose of Enron shares late in the year reflected a need to raise cash, not a concern about the health of Enron, and was not tied to a warning about the company's finances made by an Enron vice president, Mr. Silbert said today. He added that the majority of the transactions related to the credit had occurred before August. Three months later, Enron restated earnings and began its spiral into bankruptcy. 
On at least 15 occasions between February and October of last year, Mr. Silbert said, Mr. Lay returned shares in Enron to the company to repay $4 million he had received through a credit line. 
Each time the loan was repaid, Mr. Silbert said, Mr. Lay subsequently borrowed the amount available and used a substantial portion of it to repay some of the money owed on his other investments. Sometime last year, the credit line was increased to $7.5 million, Mr. Silbert said, adding that he did not know if Mr. Lay still owed any money to Enron. 
If Mr. Lay is facing financial difficulties, he went through an extraordinary amount of money during the years when Enron was riding high. From 1989 through 2001, the total of his salary, bonuses and profits from stock options topped $300 million, with most of that coming from 1998 through 2000. 
Some of the nation's wealthiest men found themselves in trouble last year, after they either invested at the height of the market mania or failed to take profits and reduce their debt in good times, a mistake that became apparent when technology stocks in particular plunged in value. 
For example, some members of the Bass family of Texas sold shares in Disney to raise some cash last year, and Craig McCaw, the telecommunications entrepreneur who foresaw the cellular phone market, has put up for sale houses, yachts, a wine collection and even an island as his holdings have declined in value. 
Much of Mr. Lay's fortune was in Enron stock and options, now worthless, but his overall investment portfolio is unknown. 
Late last year, he still owned about $8 million in stock in Compaq and Eli Lilly, and he has several properties. But around the time of Enron's demise, he put some property on the market and began selling some of those Compaq and Lilly shares as well. 
Late last year, Mr. Lay put up for sale several houses and properties he owns in Aspen, Colo., the exclusive ski resort. 
Lawmakers and Enron employees have harshly criticized Mr. Lay for promoting Enron's stock as the company's finances grew increasingly shaky last fall. In one case, Mr. Lay used an online chat on Sept. 26 to urge employees to buy Enron shares, telling them that the stock was ''an incredible bargain'' and predicting that the value of the company would increase 800 percent or more in the next decade. 
The recent disclosure that Mr. Lay returned some stock to the company to repay a loan has fueled concern that he was exiting his position as he was encouraging others to buy. 
Another lawyer, Robert S. Bennett, who represents Enron, previously disclosed that Mr. Lay used some stock to repay a loan late last year. 
Mr. Lay exercised options on Aug. 20 and 21, which was shortly after a company vice president, Sherron S. Watkins, warned him that the company might ''implode in a wave of accounting scandals.'' 
She said it was in danger of being found out as an ''elaborate accounting hoax.'' 
Today, Mr. Silbert acknowledged that around Aug. 21, Mr. Lay disposed of some stock by using it to repay a loan. He emphasized that the disposal of those shares had nothing to do with the warning from Ms. Watkins. He also said that Mr. Lay exercised options to acquire 68,000 shares on Aug. 21, and he still owns those shares. 
When Mr. Lay faced a financial strain, Mr. Silbert said, he took the course that showed the most confidence in the company. ''When the stock of Enron went down and the value of the collateral went down,'' Mr. Silbert said, ''you had two choices: sell the Enron stock, or pay down the loan. And he chose to pay down the loan rather than sell off his stock.'' 
Mr. Silbert said that Mr. Lay's faith in Enron was also evident in how he had diversified his portfolio. To make other investments, Mr. Lay put up shares of Enron and borrowed against them -- instead of selling the shares and paying in cash. That reflected Mr. Lay's belief that the Enron stock would appreciate, Mr. Silbert said. 
The transactions between Mr. Lay and Enron will be included in regular filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission next month. 
Proxies filed early last year showed that Mr. Lay had significant holdings in four companies in addition to Enron. That five-stock portfolio was a poor performer last year as the overall stock market sagged. The best stock in the group fell nearly 16 percent in 2001, while the worst two lost nearly all their value. 
Mr. Lay, who recently resigned from the boards of Compaq and Eli Lilly, sold stock in those two companies, the best performers, in the final days of October. 
He acquired 10,000 shares in Lilly in February at $74.13 a share and sold 10,000 shares at a small profit, for $77.75 apiece, in October. He sold nearly 125,000 shares of Compaq for $1.15 million at the end of October. Combined, those sales generated nearly $2 million. 
Along with his dwindling stake in Enron, whose stock plunged from $83 at the beginning of the year to under a dollar after its filing for bankruptcy, Mr. Lay's stakes dwindled in NewPower, which Enron helped finance, and i2 Technologies, which provides business-to-business Internet solutions. Shares of NewPower have lost nearly all of their value, and i2's shares fell 85 percent last year. 
In early 2001, Mr. Lay sold Enron shares on every business day, shares he had acquired by exercising options. Cumulatively, he made a profit of $21 million on those sales. Enron's stock had fallen from a high of $90.75 to half that amount, $45.35, at the end of July, when Mr. Lay stopped selling shares. 
''The reason he stopped selling was that he thought the stock was going to go up,'' Mr. Bennett said earlier this month. 
After turning down previous requests, Mr. Lay has agreed to testify on Feb. 4 before a Senate Commerce subcommittee, which is investigating Enron's collapse, Mr. Silbert said yesterday. 
In all, at least 10 Congressional committees are investigating Enron. The first hearings begin Thursday before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee and a subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The House hearing will focus on Arthur Andersen, Enron's auditor, which admitted last week that employees shredded Enron-related documents beginning in late October, after the disclosure of a government investigation into Enron. 
Today, Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan and chairman of one subcommittee investigating the company, said on the CBS program ''Face the Nation'' that in the wake of Enron's collapse, Congress would have to ''significantly tighten'' the nation's securities laws, giving the S.E.C. broad new powers. 
Citing the disclosure last week that Enron paid no income taxes in four of the last five years, Mr. Levin also said, ''We've got to change our tax laws.'' 
On NBC's ''Meet the Press,'' Andersen's chief executive, Joseph F. Berardino, said that Enron had collapsed because ''its business model failed.'' 
In an interview today, the lawyer for Ms. Watkins, Philip Hilder, said his client had been contacted by federal officials about testifying. Mr. Hilder said no date had been set, and he declined to elaborate on which government authorities had contacted her. In addition to Congress, the Justice Department and the S.E.C. are also investigating Enron's collapse. 
Mr. Hilder said his client had initially complained to Mr. Lay by anonymously dropping a one-page note into a suggestion box. Mr. Lay had invited employees to leave their concerns in the box after Jeffrey Skilling, the chief executive, had unexpectedly resigned on Aug. 14. Those concerns were discussed at an employees' meeting led by Mr. Lay on Aug. 16 at a downtown Houston hotel. 
But Mr. Hilder said his client had not been satisfied that her complaint had been fully addressed so had taken up Mr. Lay's offer to meet personally with any employee. According to documents released by Congressional investigators, her meeting with Mr. Lay was scheduled by Aug. 20, and they met on Aug. 22. 
''His response was that he would have the matter investigated,'' Mr. Hilder said. ''He treated her with courtesy and was very professional.'' 
By the end of October, Mr. Hilder said, Ms. Watkins had two meetings with Mr. Lay in his 50th-floor office of the Enron skyscraper in Houston. During one meeting, Mr. Lay told her the company had created a special committee to investigate its financial problems. Mr. Hilder, while declining to offer details, suggested that the primary topic of conversation had been Ms. Watkins's memorandum. 
''They were following up with concerns that she had previously raised,'' he said.

Lay sold off Enron stock to pay loans
Spokesman: Enron chairman wasn't bailing out on company 
By DAVID IVANOVICH 
Copyright 2002 Houston Chronicle Washington Bureau 

WASHINGTON -- Chairman Ken Lay repeatedly sold his Enron stock to pay off lines of credit advanced to him by the corporation, not because he had lost faith in the company, an Enron spokesman said Monday. 
Critics have pointed to Lay's frequent stock sales in questioning whether the company's senior executives knew the energy and trading giant was in financial peril. 
But company officials contend Lay was merely liquidating some stock he was awarded as part of his compensation. 
"Throughout the year, Ken was using a company-provided line of credit," Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said Monday. 
"The line of credit was for Ken to use as he saw fit. It's a form of compensation and quite common in large corporations for a CEO to have a line of credit available to him. 
"Of course, Ken had to pay it back, under a certain term and at a certain interest rate," Palmer said. 
Lay repaid those lines of credit using some of his Enron stock holdings. 
Since the price of Enron's stock fell through much of the year, he had to cough up more and more shares to repay the same loan amount. 
Lay's attorney, Earl J. Silbert, told the New York Times that on 15 occasions between February and October, Lay returned Enron shares to repay $4 million he had received through a line of credit. 
That credit line was later expanded to $7.5 million, the Times reported. Silbert could not be reached for comment Monday. 
Silbert said Lay also had put up shares of his stock as collateral on other investments, which he would not identify. As the Enron stock price continued to fall, Lay anticipated his lenders would require additional shares. 
In November, Lay and his wife, Linda, put three of their four Aspen, Colo., properties up for sale, seeking a total of $16.2 million, a Colorado real estate broker said. 
Lay's stock sales, however, were not all related to repaying lines of credit or other debts. 
Like many CEOs, Lay would sell a portion of the stock he got as part of his compensation, Palmer said. But he stopped at the end of July because he thought Enron's stock at that time was undervalued, Palmer said. 
"I know that he bought and held Enron stock in July and August -- stock that he still holds today," Palmer said. 
Lay exercised options to acquire 25,000 shares of Enron stock on Aug. 20 for $20.78 a share or a total of $519,500, company records show. The next day, he acquired another 68,620 shares at $21.56 a share, for a total value of nearly $1.48 million. 
By the time Enron filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy court protection on Dec. 2, Lay still held about 75 percent to 80 percent of his previous Enron stock holdings, Palmer said. 
Jon Crystal, a senior partner in the executive search firm SpencerStuart's Houston office, agreed that granting a top executive a line of credit is a fairly common corporate practice. 
Often, these lines of credit are parceled out to help executives buy company shares. The idea is that an executive who owns a sizable stake in the company will share his stockholders' financial interests. 
Sometimes, a company might forgo requiring the executive to pay interest on the loan or even forgive the loan outright as a form of additional compensation, Crystal said. 
Lay's habit of taking out a line of credit, paying off the debt and then taking out another loan is more unusual, said John Challenger, chief executive officer of Challenger, Gray and Christmas, a Chicago-based outplacement firm. 
"The question is what kind of oversight was there," Challenger said. Such an amount of activity "might stir up some warning signals."

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: TEXAS JUDGE
Enron Ruling By Nominee To U.S. Court Is Being Noticed

HOUSTON, Jan. 21 -- A Texas Supreme Court justice who has been nominated by President Bush to fill a vacant federal judgeship could face a fierce Senate confirmation fight because her critics say she once wrote an opinion that saved the Enron Corporation about $15 million after accepting campaign contributions from the company. 
Liberal groups, who had already opposed the nomination of the justice, Priscilla Owen, because of her conservative voting record, now plan to use her connections to Enron to try to derail her nomination.
''I think the combination of campaign contributions from Enron and the fact that she ruled clearly in Enron's favor in that case could be a subject of significant concern by the committee,'' said Elliot M. Mincberg, legal director of People for the American Way, a liberal group that monitors judicial nominations. 
Justice Owen, 47, could not be reached for comment. She is considered by legal analysts in Texas to be among the most conservative members of the Texas Supreme Court, which, in turn, is considered one of the nation's most conservative supreme courts. Last year, Mr. Bush nominated her for a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The Senate Judiciary Committee has not scheduled a hearing for Justice Owen. 
Unlike many other states, Texas elects its judges, and candidates in competitive state Supreme Court races can spend more than $1 million on a race. Justice Owen was elected in 1994, and Enron's political action committee and executives gave her $8,600. In 1996, Justice Owen's critics note that she wrote the majority opinion in a unanimous decision that reversed a lower court order and reduced by about $15 million the amount of school taxes paid by Enron. 
A study released last month by Texans for Public Justice, a nonprofit group that tracks campaign contributions in Texas, found that since 1993, Enron has contributed $134,058 to members of the state Supreme Court, including the donation to Justice Owen. That total was the most donated by any corporation. 
The study found that Enron had a high success rate on cases before the court. In three cases brought by Enron, the court ruled in its favor twice. In three cases brought against Enron, the court ruled in the company's favor each time. 
''Texas's high court judges are all tainted by campaign-related conflicts of interest,'' said Craig McDonald, director of Texans for Public Justice. ''Two months ago, Bush might have been able to put an Enron judge on the appeals court. But he's not likely to get away with it now.'' 
Justice Owen, who attended Baylor College of Law, has often been considered a member of the Texas court's conservative bloc, led by Justice Nathan Hecht. As governor, Mr. Bush appointed four justices to vacant seats on the Supreme Court, all of whom were considered by legal analysts to be more moderate than Justice Owen. 
Dick Trabulsi, chairman of the political action committee for Texans Against Lawsuit Reform, a conservative judicial reform group, said any criticism of Justice Owen because she sided with Enron was misguided. ''We think it's very unfair in a state that elects judges to be making connections between the way a judge rules and a donation that is made,'' he said. 
''We have always found she exercises exceptional judgment,'' he added, calling her a person of integrity.

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE PROSECUTOR
A Specialist in Tough Cases Steps Into the Legal Tangle
By JO THOMAS

The New York Times
Page 8, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

HOUSTON, Jan. 20 -- Leslie R. Caldwell, the Federal prosecutor who will oversee the day-to-day investigation of the collapse of Enron, has an eye for corporate books that have been cooked and defendants who will talk, her former colleagues say. 
At 44, she has been involved in more than 50 jury trials and big, complicated investigations, first in Brooklyn. Later in San Francisco, she became involved when stockholders of McKesson HBOC lost $9 billion as share prices fell nearly 50 percent in one day.
In September 2000, when Ms. Caldwell announced the indictments of the former co-presidents of HBO and Company, a Georgia medical software company, on charges that they had used undisclosed agreements and sham sales to inflate the company's sales and profits before selling it to McKesson, a distributor of prescription drugs, she minced no words. 
''I'm hoping cases like this will send a message to corporate boardrooms and suites that they actually could go to jail for this,'' she said. ''This isn't just managing your numbers or tweaking accounts here and there. This is putting your whole company at risk, and if you do that, there are going to be serious consequences.'' 
Ms. Caldwell, who is chief of the securities fraud division of the United States attorney's office in San Francisco, will eventually set up offices in Washington and Houston. Almost all of the members of the legal staff of the United States attorney in Houston have been disqualified because they are acquainted with Enron employees, so Ms. Caldwell and the task force of lawyers she is still recruiting will find office space somewhere else in the city. 
In the meantime, she is working from what Matthew J. Jacobs, an assistant United States attorney in San Francisco, described as a virtual office, ''wherever the action is.'' 
This week she will be in Washington, where Larry D. Thompson, the deputy attorney general, is in charge of the inquiry. Attorney General John Ashcroft has recused himself. The department is expected to assemble as many as 10 prosecutors to work under Ms. Caldwell on the Enron investigation, which is likely to last many months. 
In building a white-collar criminal case, government investigators try to find the easiest initial steps that can provide witnesses. Legal experts said the government would almost certainly first break off a manageable piece of the case involving potential witnesses to broader aspects of the collapse. 
For that reason, these experts said, prosecutors will probably spend much of their initial effort looking into the document destruction at Arthur Andersen, Enron's accounting firm. If a criminal case can be brought, these experts said, the government would have its first strong negotiating lever. 
It is likely that Ms. Caldwell and the Justice Department will have to negotiate with Congressional panels that are calling witnesses and demanding to see company documents. Kenneth L. Lay, the Enron chairman, is scheduled to testify before a Senate Commerce subcommittee in February. 
Speaking of such Congressional witnesses, Joseph E. DiGenova, a former United States attorney and former independent prosecutor, said: ''It would be unwise for them to testify without immunity, and the Department of Justice would object to that. It's too early to tell who knew what and when.'' 
A grant of Congressional immunity makes a subsequent criminal prosecution almost impossible, as the government learned after the convictions of John M. Poindexter and Oliver L. North were overturned in the Iran-contra case. 
Ms. Caldwell is no stranger to either complexity or difficulty. She was a relatively new Federal prosecutor in 1989 when she was given a major role in prosecuting two dozen defendants in a southeast Queens drug trafficking case that included Lorenzo Nichols and Howard Mason. They were also suspected of ordering the killings of a police officer and a parole officer. 
She was faced with thousands of wiretapped conversations and a flood of pretrial motions from defense lawyers, but she won the drug convictions. She pressured Mr. Nichols into pleading guilty to conspiring in the murder of his parole officer. Mr. Mason was convicted on charges of ordering the killing of Officer Edward Byrne. Mr. Nichols got a 40-year sentence; Mr. Mason is serving a life sentence. 
Ms. Caldwell, a native of Pittsburgh who received her law degree from George Washington University Law School in Washington, went on to win a string of highly publicized cases involving neighborhood-level organized crime. She got life sentences for Gerald Miller, leader of a drug ring in Queens, and for Clifford Wong, a Chinatown business leader who was convicted in January 1995 of murder, extortion and racketeering. Another Chinatown civic leader, Paul Lai, pleaded guilty to murder-conspiracy and racketeering in 1996. 
That year Ms. Caldwell oversaw the prosecution of the Raysor Organization, a violent gang that prosecutors said dominated the Bedford-Stuyvesant crack trade. 
Jerry Roth, a criminal defense lawyer in San Francisco who worked with Ms. Caldwell as a federal prosecutor in the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn, said she had ''terrific rapport.'' 
''In dealing with the crack cases,'' he said, ''she found that some of the co-operators had a language they were speaking among themselves -- they called it bebop -- so she learned it. She would speak it to them, and it both created rapport and eliminated their ability to talk behind her back.'' 
As chief of the United States attorney's violent criminal enterprises section in the Eastern District of New York, Ms. Caldwell led a team of 10 prosecutors. She later became a senior trial counsel and prosecuted securities fraud in small-cap stock markets. In December 1998, Robert S. Mueller III, now head of the F.B.I. but then the United States attorney in San Francisco, announced that she would become chief of his securities fraud unit. 
Valerie Caproni, who worked as a Federal prosecutor in Brooklyn before becoming the regional director of the Securities and Exchange Commission's office in Los Angeles, praised the appointment. ''She was a star from the beginning,'' said Ms. Caproni, who is now in New York as a defense lawyer with Simpson Thatcher & Bartlett. ''Not everyone can relate to an illiterate, ignorant violent drug dealer and to the chief financial officer of a corporation. She can do both.'' 
''What she is really good at,'' Ms. Caproni added, ''is getting people to cooperate with the government and using their talents to figure out the shortest distance through a forest of information. She has good judgment about what is appropriately viewed as a criminal case, and she is not afraid to stand up and say, 'This just isn't a crime -- as terrible as the results may have been.' ''

Accounting for Enron: SEC Feels Heat Over Exemptions to Enron --- In 1993, Agency Ruled Two of Firm's Units Needen't Register
By Michael Schroeder
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

WASHINGTON -- The Securities and Exchange Commission is coming under heat in Congress for a 1993 decision that freed units of Enron Corp. from complying with a utility holding company law that would have given regulators stronger oversight of the company's operations. 
The SEC is reviewing a 1993 staff ruling to absolve the Enron units from registering under the Public Utility Holding Company Act, a 1935 law that gives the agency extensive supervision of corporate structure and business operations of registered utility holding companies, according to people with knowledge of the matter. If the decision is found to have been erroneous, it could change the way other utility holding companies are regulated.
Two Enron entities received waivers from the public utility holding company rules. In one case, Enron's Portland General Electric Co. unit in Oregon clearly qualified for an exemption that applies to holding companies that own and operate a utility in a single state. But in late 1993, Enron Power Marketing Inc., Enron's wholesale power-selling unit, successfully argued that it too shouldn't be regulated by the SEC. 
In what isn't a clear-cut case, utility lawyers say that the SEC could have been within its authority to require Enron Power Marketing to register. Instead, an SEC staff attorney issued the Enron unit a "no-action letter," or waiver, without addressing the legal issues in the Enron unit's application. 
On Capitol Hill, the Enron scandal has spurred a debate over sweeping power utility deregulation legislation, which among other provisions would repeal the utility holding company law. With debate on the legislation scheduled for next month in both the House and Senate, some Democrats vow to block the repeal unless the bills contain stronger consumer protections. They also say they will scrutinize the SEC's performance overseeing utility holding companies. 
"In light of Enron, I think the Congress needs to thoroughly investigate the SEC's rather poor record of administering Puhca," said Rep. Ed Markey (D., Mass.). 
Spokesmen for the SEC and Enron declined to comment. 
The Depression-era law was passed to avoid the abuses committed by utility holding companies in the 1920s. Back then, holding companies had complicated "pyramiding" structures with subsidiaries owning other holding companies engaged in risky businesses unrelated to power generation. The activities led to utility bankruptcies and massive losses for shareholders who believed they were buying conservative investments. 
The law directs the SEC to regulate the activities of large, multistate electric or gas utility holding companies and to limit their diversification into nonutility businesses. Under the law, the SEC enforces special accounting requirements, limits on utility mergers and expansion, and tough restrictions on affiliate relationships. Thirty-five companies are covered by the law. 
"If Enron had been regulated under Puhca, I seriously doubt that the types of transactions that brought this company down would have occurred," Mr. Markey said. 
While the SEC action on Enron's units predated many of the financial activities that led to Enron's downfall, Tyson Slocum, a utility expert at Public Citizen, a consumer advocate organization, argues that Enron developed into precisely the kind of utility holding company structure the law was designed to block. The Houston energy company, originally a utility that produced and transported natural gas and electricity, increased in complexity as it shifted its focus to energy trading. In its financial statements filed with the SEC, Enron lists more than 5,800 subsidiaries and affiliates. 
Supporters of repealing Pucha say it has created anticompetitive regulatory barriers to new investment in electricity generation and transmission facilities. Repeal is expected to greatly accelerate mergers to consolidate the $315 billion electricity and natural-gas sectors. 
Indeed, the SEC has favored repeal for more than a decade, arguing its provisions duplicate existing disclosure rules or are better administered by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. But in the aftermath of the Enron debacle, critics of repeal may have gained the upper hand in the debate. 
To address critics' issues, Rep. Joe Barton, the Texas Republican who chairs the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on energy and air quality, has said if the utility law is repealed, there must be a strong "mechanism" for accounting, reporting and bookkeeping.

Former employees seek voice in Chapter 11 case 
Copyright 2002 Houston Chronicle 

A group of former Enron employees has asked a U.S. bankruptcy judge to appoint a committee to represent their interests in the company's Chapter 11 proceedings. 
"We need representation for the common employees," said Rod Gardner, chairman of the Severed Enron Employees Coalition, which represents more than 250 former workers. 
The bankruptcy case already has a creditors committee made up mostly of large banks such as J.P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup. One former Enron employee, Michael P. Moran, a lawyer who lives in Montgomery, was appointed to the creditors committee. 
When it filed for bankruptcy on Dec. 2, Enron suggested that employees who wanted more severance pay should file claims with the bankruptcy court. 
Gardner said the coalition has hired Miami lawyer Scott Baena, a senior partner with Bilzin Sumberg Dunn Baena Price & Axelrod, to represent its interests in seeking more compensation. 
Adding extra committees in a bankruptcy case is rare, but Enron's proceedings, the largest ever, is itself unprecedented. 
A hearing on the motion before Judge Arthur Gonzalez has not been set.

Jilted by Enron, Workers Turn to Web to Find Community, Job Leads

THE ENRON IMPLOSION was well under way when Katie Walthall lost her job on Nov. 12. Ms. Walthall, an outside contractor at the ill-fated energy company, was given a box, told to pack up and shown the door. 
Now she's back at work, with help from an online community of former Enron employees. By keeping tabs on message-board discussions and tracking down former colleagues by e-mail, Ms. Walthall, 26 years old, found a new job at MRE Consulting. "These sites have been awesome," she says.
Cut off suddenly from colleagues and friends, thousands of former Enron employees have come together online in surrogate communities. These electronic gathering places serve as a combination alumni club, career-services department and water cooler for those who no longer have an office. 
The speed with which Enron's jilted workers have regrouped on the Net says a lot about their drive and skills. It's also a fresh reminder of the reach of online communications. What just a few years ago would have required phone calls, photocopies and faxes can be accomplished online in minutes. These days, it's easy to take that power for granted. 

MONDAY, DEC. 3, was the last day in the office for some 4,000 Enron employees laid off in Houston. Jose Lazo, a 21-year-old database analyst, was one of them. He had an idea for a Web site to help ex-Enron employees, and he approached Techxans, a Houston group that holds networking events for technology professionals, for help. 
The next day, EnronX.org was up and running, thanks to an all-nighter by Anthony Huang, a Houston entrepreneur who works with Techxans. "Everyone was amazed," Mr. Huang says. "It used to take dot-coms months of work to put up a site." 
The EnronX.org home page parodies the look of Enron's corporate site, replacing a photo of a buff cyclist with a picture of a football player with his gut hanging out. Below that is a calendar of events (a "Surviving a Layoff" lecture, job fairs) and links to the latest Enron news stories. 
Other sections point to job-training resources and sources of health insurance. There are links to debt counselors and relief funds. Law firms post announcements seeking people willing to join in class-action suits, and reporters list their e-mail addresses in hopes of snagging tips on the scandal. Mr. Huang says the site is being run on a volunteer basis, though it has accepted advertising from insurers and law firms to defray costs. 
Most relevant for the typical EnronX.org visitor, however, are the job listings, which cover everything from energy-trading jobs at giant utility Exelon to a sales-associate post at a local Circuit City. A determined job hunter could spend hours e-mailing resumes to all of the employers listed on the site. 
But actually finding a job is a lot tougher than just firing off e-mails, as any ex-Enron employee will tell you. "You've got 1,000 positions being followed up on by 3,000 people," says Rudy Sutherland, 35, who was a manager on a power-trading risk-analysis desk and is still job hunting. 
Sacked workers say old-fashioned networking remains the key to landing a job, but their networking has been supercharged by the alumni sites. At 1400smith.com, named after the street address of Enron's Houston headquarters, there's a directory of more than 5,700 people. Former Enron employees can visit the site, add contact information to the directory and look up former co-workers. 

CONSIDERING HOW MANY Enron workers had communicated mainly by office e-mail or phone and didn't have home addresses or phone numbers for colleagues, the directory has become a lifeline. Preston Ochsner, 27, spent his job-hunting days looking up former co-workers and then keeping in touch with them by phone, e-mail and AOL Instant Messenger. His networking paid off when he learned from a laid-off colleague about an Enron alum at AES NewEnergy who had information about positions there. "People need to meet face to face and by phone," says Mr. Ochsner, who just joined AES as a supply analyst. "Responding to postings is easy, but personal contacts worked for me." 
The 1400smith.com site was launched by former Enron Webmaster Brandon Rigney and Charles Turcich, who worked for Enron as a contractor. Besides the directory, it has an active message board. Though some of the discussions are given over to general griping, with one disgruntled visitor bashing Enron CEO Kenneth Lay as "Osama Ken Layden," most of the postings are related to job hunting, benefits and other severance issues. 
Enron alumni abroad have their own outposts. EnronX.net (not affiliated with EnronX.org) and Kenron.net both serve workers in the U.K. and throughout Europe. Meanwhile, some enterprising alums appear to have found a new way to tap the Web: selling Enron mugs, golf balls and other memorabilia on eBay. Last week, bidding on an Enron fanny pack was already up to nearly $50. 

SECURITY CHECK: Two weeks ago I called on computer users to break their Microsoft habit because of recurring security problems with the company's software. Now Bill Gates says he's getting serious about safer software, too. In a companywide e-mail Tuesday, he told employees that better security will henceforth take priority over new features in Microsoft's products. Let's hope Mr. Gates's minions can deliver.

Enron Was No Friend to Free Markets
By Jerry Taylor

01/21/2002
The Wall Street Journal
A12
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

While it's still unclear exactly what caused the implosion at Enron, ideological playwrights are already busily casting the company in the starring role for their pet political morality plays. The most common scripts being written have cast Enron CEO Ken Lay as Adam Smith on steroids and the corporation itself as the avatar of irresponsible, run-amuck capitalism. 
Those of us who've been involved in the energy debates of the 1990s know different. Enron was less the 21st-century incarnation of Robber Baronry than it was the latter-day inheritors of the mantle worn by Archer-Daniels Midland, the corporation that would hardly exist were it not for government favor and regulatory help.
Enron is most famously known for pioneering wholesale electricity and natural gas trading. Since ending the legally protected franchises that utilities had on those services was a prerequisite for Enron's strategy, the company lobbied aggressively for competition and "consumer choice" for gas and electricity services. 
But while donning the garb of Ronald Reagan on the one hand, the company was donning the mantle of Ralph Nader when it came to the transmission and distribution side of the energy business. Enron, you see, was worried that the incumbent utilities would either under-price the non-utility competitors that Enron wanted on their trading floors or, alternatively, would charge such high prices for access to their transmission systems that non-utility gas and electricity providers would be unable to effectively compete for business. 
So Enron insisted that electric utilities be forced by law to get out of the generation business, that strict price controls be set for the rates charged for access to the various transmission grids, and that the day-to-day operation of the electricity distribution systems be handed over to state officials who were directed to govern those systems at the behest of the system's "stakeholders" (read: Enron and friends). So Reaganite competition, according to Enron, required new micromanagerial rules about industrial organization and the de-facto nationalization of the transmission systems by officials who'd have to answer to Enron. 
Many times over the past decade I found myself in meetings or on conference panels with Enron officials. On each and every occasion, the "jungle capitalists" from Houston were apoplectic over arguments that the grid should be deregulated like the wholesale power markets. They also ranted against the idea that companies should be able to charge whatever they wished for access to their property, that the grids should be left in private hands, or that government cannot know a priori how best to organize private enterprises and should thus refrain from imposing arrangements on the market. 
While most legislators got a full dose of Enron's regulatory agenda, some were hearing from the company that, well, grid owners should be left alone to do as they wanted. Those legislators, however, came from regions where Enron had managed to buy the transmission systems in question before the debate was settled. So officials from Texas, Louisiana, and various parts of South America in charge of the gas pipelines that Enron had bought were hearing one story while the rest of the political world was hearing another. 
That pattern of regulatory opportunism extended virtually everywhere, but perhaps no more so than on the environmental front. Enron, for instance, managed to pick up several near-bankrupt wind and solar power companies over the years and treated them like political lottery tickets. Wherever Enron went, pious campaigns for the virtues of renewable energy subsidies (in effect, subsidies for Enron) were sure to follow. 
Likewise, Enron saw spectacular business opportunities in the trading of greenhouse gas emission permits and accordingly argued for aggressive action to address global warming. And given that natural gas would be less disadvantaged by carbon emission controls than would competitor fuels like coal and oil, Enron was more than happy to link hands with nearly every environmental activist that crossed its path to undertake war against America's carbon-based energy economy. 
Whether it was de facto support of the Kyoto Protocol, the outspoken embrace of Clinton's proposed BTU tax (which would give Enron a competitive advantage in the marketplace), or the occasional attempt to secure a tax on oil imports (necessary back in the 1980s to save one of its pipelines in Florida), Enron was more than happy to hammer energy consumers with the power of government to fatten its own bottom line. 
While Enron was adept in putting together these coalitions to expand the regulatory state, it was no slouch at more conventional raids on the public treasury. Since 1996, for instance, Enron managed to bag $450 million to underwrite its investments in India, Brazil, and Guatemala through the auspices of the taxpayer-financed Overseas Private Investment Corporation. Another $135 million was liberated from the Export-Import Bank over that same period to underwrite Enron's investments in Venezuela. There was virtually nothing that the corporation did that wasn't worth a handout from the taxpayers, according to Enron lobbyists. 
On balance, Enron was an enemy, not an ally, of free markets. Enron was more interested in rigging the marketplace with rules and regulations to advantage itself at the expense of competitors and consumers than in making money the old fashioned way -- by earning it honestly from their customers through voluntary trade. Indeed, Enron would probably still be a small-time pipeline company were it not for the statist conceit that consumers are better off under the regulatory boot of government than with the invisible hand of the marketplace. There's a morality play here all right, but it's the opposite from that being readied for a political theater near you.

THE ENRON INQUIRY Enron Refuels Energy Debate Politics: The power industry moves to fight growing skepticism of deregulation after the collapse of its most vocal proponent and the crisis in California last year.

WASHINGTON -- The nation's energy industry is mobilizing in the aftermath of Enron Corp.'s collapse against attempts to slow down or reverse deregulation of power markets, setting the stage for the biggest debate over the issue since the California energy crisis last year. 
Electricity suppliers and other energy players are talking with James J. Hoecker, former chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and now a Washington lobbyist, about creating a coalition of deregulation proponents that will lobby Congress, testify at forthcoming hearings, file comments on proposed rules and, if necessary, take legal action to block efforts to re-regulate the industry.
"Our concern is that some people are now saying that Enron could not have amassed such an inflated stock value and done the things that it did if not for the fact that energy markets have become much freer in the last three years," said Hoecker, insisting that Enron's bankruptcy filing Dec. 2 instead appears to have been caused by accounting practices unrelated to energy deregulation. 
The national debate over energy deregulation was largely overshadowed by the Sept. 11 terrorist strikes. But Enron's collapse has reignited the issue, with critics of deregulation saying energy is too vital to the public good to be left to volatile markets. Some lawmakers are advocating a go-slow approach on further deregulation of energy markets. 
"There is a lot more skepticism about deregulation now," said Howard A. Learner, executive director at the Environmental Law & Policy Center, a Chicago-based advocacy organization that favors a hybrid model of competition and government oversight. 
Hoecker, who has been criticized by California leaders for not doing more to help the state during last year's energy crisis, said he expected a decision about the new coalition to be made shortly, but declined to identify specific participants. 
Some companies, such as Dynegy Inc., already have deployed their lobbying forces. 
One factor propelling the lobbying push was FERC's Jan. 15 announcement that it was moving quickly to hire a director for the newly created Office of Market Oversight and Investigations, which will be responsible for overseeing and auditing the nation's energy markets. 
FERC Chairman Patrick H. Wood III floated the new office last fall, but industry leaders fear that FERC may try to give the office sweeping new powers in light of the Enron debacle. 
Wood, a former Texas utility regulator appointed by President Bush, declined to be interviewed. 
FERC Commissioner Nora M. Brownell, another Bush appointee who favors deregulation and competitive markets, said the industry need not worry about punitive responses from FERC's new oversight division. She said the California energy crisis, in which some suppliers were accused of creating electricity shortages to inflate prices, highlighted the need for a greater federal role. 
"To make the markets work, you have to have a market oversight function that people believe in," Brownell said. "Before, there wasn't a place people could go. When the industry understands that this is going to be fair, they'll calm down." 
Enron Leaves Lobbying Void 
Houston-based Enron had been the most vocal supporter of deregulation, but its tumble into Bankruptcy Court has forced other industry players to step up to the plate to fill the lobbying void. 
"Enron was the 800-pound gorilla for deregulation," Learner said. "With Enron out of the picture, now everyone else in the industry can't piggyback on its political and financial juices." 
Enron grew from a small natural-gas pipeline operator into the world's largest energy-trading operation. At its peak, it handled one in four wholesale deals for electricity, gas and other energy products. 
Because Enron helped keep energy trading exempt from oversight by FERC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, deregulation supporters are bracing for an effort to bring the energy markets--and particularly online trading--under more government supervision. 
Energy companies also fear that an Enron-related backlash might cause some states to rethink their deregulation plans or prompt new federal regulations that would limit how much they can charge and what their access to different markets might be. 
California, for one, has taken a big step back from deregulation. 
To stabilize prices, the state purchased more than $10 billion of power for utility customers in the last year and won't be out of the power-buying business until at least 2003. 
What's more, the Legislature created a public power agency that is authorized to build more power plants if private industry fails to come through with adequate supplies. 
With these and other factors causing uncertainty, California politicians are debating whether the solution lies in more or less government regulation. 
State Sen. Steve Peace (D-El Cajon), who helped craft California's 1996 deregulation plan in the Legislature, said California politicians and business leaders must unite to fight Hoecker's agenda. The chief beneficiaries of the sort of "wild West" form of deregulation Hoecker's group espouses, Peace said, are bound to be big oil and gas companies based out of state. 
Peace argues that California's experiment with deregulation failed not because it was poorly constructed but because federal regulators in Washington, unduly influenced by companies such as Enron, refused to referee the market. 
Hoecker disagrees: "There's a big difference between reasonable oversight and re-regulation." 
Other energy lobbyists stress that Enron's demise was largely unrelated to its energy business. 
"The failure of Enron wasn't a failure of the competitive markets," said Dynegy spokesman David Byford. The Houston-based energy company, which abruptly called off a proposed purchase of Enron in November, is dispatching its lobbyists to Capitol Hill and regulatory agencies to urge Washington not to overreact to Enron's implosion. 
Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach), a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, rejected the notion that Enron's meltdown should cause Congress to rethink deregulation. 
"Enron could have been in the Hula-Hoop business and done exactly the same thing," he said. 
Enron's swift demise last fall after disclosures of more than $600 million in losses and the existence of several complex, off-balance-sheet partnerships is being investigated by several federal agencies and members of Congress. 
Still, because of the California electricity crisis, further deregulation of energy markets was already in some trouble. Now critics of deregulation are pouncing on Enron's troubles to bolster their case. 
Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) has called an electricity deregulation bill the "One Last Gift for Enron Act." 
But deregulation supporters say that Enron's troubles have nothing to do with energy markets. 
A spokeswoman for Rep. Joe Barton (R-Texas), chairman of a House energy subcommittee, said her boss was pressing ahead on his electricity restructuring bill. 
Barton believes that "Enron's problems were Enron-based. They weren't demonstrative of a greater flaw in the energy markets or industry," Samantha Jordan said. 
Deregulation Push Expected to Lose Steam 
"We need to figure out how to prevent future energy collapses like Enron," Waxman said during a recent debate. "The answer will require more regulation and oversight and oversight of energy marketers--not more deregulation." 
Waxman contends that the theory advanced by deregulation proponents is based on a belief that large energy companies will always bet right in the energy market. 
But as Enron proves, that's not the case, he said, contending that some of the company's problems eventually will be traced to bad decisions about energy purchases. 
A spokesman for Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, expects the Enron collapse to damp enthusiasm for deregulation because lawmakers will want to sort out the implications of the Enron collapse for the energy markets. 
Although some in Congress argue that Enron's collapse has nothing to do with their core energy businesses or the energy markets, Markey spokesman David Moulton said he doesn't know how anyone can reach that conclusion without further study. 
"We don't know the full extent of Enron's 'book'--that is, the long-term energy contracts or derivatives that they entered into with other firms. It is quite possible that there could be issues with some of those other trades, but we won't know for sure unless we look," Moulton said. "We're opposed to taking the government out of the business of overseeing the electricity markets. You can't just take the government out of the business and expect to get a good result." 
Learner of the Environmental Law & Policy Center said the regulatory "black hole" may have enabled Enron to inflate the amount of revenue it was collecting from trades. 
The debate is likely to pick up Jan. 29, when Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.), chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, has scheduled a hearing on what Enron's collapse means for energy markets. 
More than $12 billion of investment in new power plants has been shelved in recent weeks as financial markets effectively raised the cost of capital and began more closely scrutinizing the debt and balance sheets of borrowers, energy experts say. Such cutbacks could lead to power shortages and higher costs for consumers. 
Enron Collapse Didn't Rock Energy Market 
But Craig Goodman, president of the National Energy Marketers Assn., and others contend that the Enron collapse proved that deregulation works because it did not result in immediate price spikes, trading hiccups or loss of confidence among energy traders. 
"The fact that Enron's demise caused literally no dislocation in the marketplace proves that deregulation can work," he said. "Indeed, dozens of new and old wholesale players, with huge amounts of real assets, not just paper assets, have stepped in to fill the void left by Enron." 
According to FERC's Brownell, "The markets worked with ruthless efficiency."

Enron Properties Outside the U.S. Hit Auction Block
A Wall Street Journal News Roundup

SEOUL, South Korea -- Enron Corp.'s assets overseas are starting to go on the auction block. 
Tractebel SA, a Belgian energy and infrastructure company, has submitted a bid to buy Enron's 50% stake in South Korea's SK-Enron Co., which distributes natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas, said Marc Josz, president and chief executive of Tractebel Asia Ltd. in Bangkok. Enron invested about $240 million for the 50% stake in SK-Enron.
In India, creditors to Enron's $2.9 billion Dabhol Power Co. project are set to put it up for sale. 
The developments come after Houston-based Enron filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-court protection on Dec. 2, the largest such filing ever. The move shields Enron from creditors as the company seeks to pare debt and reorganize operations. 
In the Korean case, Tractebel's Mr. Josz said companies were invited in December to present their competitive strategies to Korean energy regulators; he expects a final decision on the bids in a week. He confirmed Korean media reports that Royal/Dutch Shell Group, the British-Dutch oil powerhouse, and Houston-based El Paso Corp. had bid. A Shell spokesman declined to comment. At El Paso, a spokesman said he had no knowledge of a bid for Enron's Korean assets. The other half of SK-Enron is owned by South Korea's SK Corp., an energy and chemicals company. 
SK-Enron, an energy holding company, holds about 25% of South Korea's natural-gas-distribution market and 50% of the liquefied-petroleum-gas-distribution market. 
In India, Industrial Development Bank of India is overseeing bidding for Enron's power plant, about 150 miles south of Bombay. The Overseas Private Investment Corp., a U.S. agency that financed the project with $340 million in loan guarantees and political risk insurance, is helping the creditor group find a new buyer. 
"People are trying to put together a bidding process, and we're working with everybody over there to make sure that happens," Lawrence Spinelli, an OPIC spokesman, said yesterday. He said creditors decided to launch the bidding at a Singapore meeting last month. 
The project has been the subject of political bickering, unpaid bills and unproven allegations of bribery since its conception in the early 1990s. In May 2001, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board stopped paying for power from the plant in a dispute largely about pricing. A few months later, with the board $240 million in arrears, Enron said it would gladly sell its stake in the project. 
Enron owns 65% of the project, General Electric Co. and construction company Bechtel Corp. each own 10% and the Maharashtra board owns 15%. 
Dabhol filed a $180 million claim with OPIC last month, arguing that the Maharashtra board's failure to pay its power bills was tantamount to expropriation -- an act that would be covered by the OPIC policy.

Accounting for Enron: U.S. Fought for Company's Project in India

WASHINGTON -- When Richard Celeste gave his farewell speech as President Clinton's ambassador to India, he lectured Indians about the sanctity of contracts. It was clear to the audience he was referring to Enron Corp.'s frustration trying to build a $2.9 billion power plant outside Bombay. 
After presenting his credentials this summer, Ambassador Robert D. Blackwill wasted no time in warning the Indians that Enron's problems were at the top of the Bush administration's commercial agenda.
"I want to be frank," Mr. Blackwill told the Indo-American Chamber of Commerce and the Indo-American Society. "These disputes have darkened India's investment climate." 
Across party lines and administrations, Enron has had an active ally in Washington throughout its battle with Indian officials over the Dabhol electric-power project. From the early 1990s, when Enron waded into its Indian quagmire, right up until it filed for bankruptcy protection last month, the Houston energy company counted on the U.S. government to argue its case. 
At least one energy secretary, four commerce secretaries, three U.S. ambassadors and Vice President Dick Cheney are among the senior American officials who prodded the Indians to resolve the Enron dispute. President Clinton assigned a senior aide to monitor the project. President Bush has a Dabhol "working group" to help Enron's cause. From conception to collapse, the U.S. government pushed the deal, financed the deal and attempted to salvage the deal amid political bickering, unpaid bills and unproven allegations of bribery in India. 
The administration's motives are muddied by Enron's close financial ties with senior members of both parties, including President Bush. Enron executives and employees have contributed nearly $6 million to politicians since the 1990 election cycle, 74% of it to Republicans, according to federal data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics, a campaign-finance watchdog group. Enron and its executives gave $736,800 to Mr. Bush for his gubernatorial and presidential campaigns, as well as his presidential inaugural fund and election-recount war chest. 
U.S. officials uniformly explain their assistance as a natural extension of American foreign policy, unrelated to the considerable political clout of Enron or its chairman, Kenneth Lay. Both the Clinton and Bush administrations have encouraged developing nations to open their borders to U.S. companies, and Enron's is the largest investment India has ever received. 
Frank Wisner, U.S. ambassador in New Delhi from 1994-97, argued Enron's case frequently and vociferously, including with the staff of then-Prime Minister Narasimha Rao. After leaving India, Mr. Wisner became a director of an Enron-affiliated company, Enron Oil & Gas, and he is chairman of the U.S.-India Business Council. 
"I'd do it all over again," Mr. Wisner said of his advocacy. "It was the right policy. I only regret it didn't work, for India's sake as well as the investors." John Hardy, Enron's vice president of global finance, and Linda Robertson, head of its Washington office, didn't return calls seeking comment. 
Enron's power plant is a saga of failure that began when the Indian government invited foreign investors to provide electric power for India's growing economy. 
Mr. Lay joined then-Commerce Secretary Ron Brown on a trade mission to India in early 1995. Weeks later, Enron closed the initial funding on a deal that eventually would give it 65% of the Dabhol Power Co. General Electric Co. and Bechtel Corp. owned 10% each, and the local power company, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, held the rest. The board also agreed to buy the electricity the plant would produce, an accord that became the heart of the project's downfall. 
Two U.S. government agencies, the Export-Import Bank and the Overseas Private Investment Corp., teamed up to provide Dabhol $642 million in financing guarantees and risk insurance. Both agencies describe the financing as exactly the kind of support they are supposed to give to American companies. Their money is in turn guaranteed by Indian banks, in the Ex-Im Bank's case, or the Indian state or central governments, in OPIC's case. 
But not long after the deal was signed, a Hindu nationalist party, Shiv Sena, took power in Maharashtra state and canceled the project. The party accused its predecessors and Enron of corruption and complained that Dabhol's electricity was too expensive for the state power company. Then-Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary was among the U.S. officials who traveled to India at that time and warned authorities that India was tarnishing its reputation with foreign investors. 
Late in 1995, Enron and the state authorities struck a deal, with the company agreeing to lower rates. President Clinton had a senior aide monitor the project. At one point or another during the dispute, President Clinton's commerce secretaries -- Mr. Brown, Mickey Kantor and William Daley -- all took up Enron's case, according to Raymond E. Vickery Jr., who was assistant secretary for trade development under all three. "It was the leading U.S. foreign direct investment in India, and the status of the Dabhol power plant came up at virtually every mission," Mr. Vickery recalled. 
In May 1999, electricity began flowing and financing for an expansion arranged, but the project didn't run smoothly. In May 2001, the state electricity board stopped paying its Dabhol bills in a dispute largely about pricing. A few months later, with the board $240 million in arrears, Enron gave up and said it would gladly sell its stake in the project. 
Enron's contacts with the U.S. government, which by then meant the Bush administration, continued through that period. In June, Vice President Cheney raised Enron's concern about being paid for electricity generated by Dabhol in a meeting in Washington with Sonia Gandhi, leader of the Congress Party, which now controlled Maharashtra. Another party leader accompanying Ms. Gandhi told reporters of the conversation afterward, and the White House confirmed it last week. White House officials said the vice president brought the subject up because it was in briefing papers prepared by the National Security Council, and because OPIC had money in the project. 
"It is an important project to create jobs in America, and there's also a taxpayer exposure" through OPIC, White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said Friday. Indeed, Dabhol Power Co. filed a $180 million insurance claim with OPIC last month, arguing that the electricity board's failure to pay its bills amounts to expropriation. 
The Enron connections reached deep into the administration, however. OPIC released documents last week under the Freedom of Information Act revealing that the National Security Council leads an administration working group dedicated to Enron's cause in India; Treasury, State, Ex-Im and OPIC also are represented in the group. Mr. Fleischer confirmed a New York Daily News report that top Bush economic adviser Lawrence Lindsey had been told by the White House counsel to recuse himself from matters involving Dabhol because he had served a consultant to Enron. 
In July, Christina B. Rocca, assistant secretary of State, discussed India's investment climate at a meeting of the Confederation of Indian Industries and announced that "many of India's problems in this regard can be summed up in the five-letter word, Enron." 
On Oct. 15, as Enron was collapsing, Commerce Secretary Donald Evans hooked Mr. Lay up with Sig Rogich, a Las Vegas-based Republican public-relations man with connections to the Indian government. Mr. Rogich, an Evans friend, had been a special assistant to former President George H.W. Bush, and had worked on the Bush-Cheney campaign. The conversation was first reported in Newsweek. 
Indian officials wanted Mr. Rogich to help them improve the country's image in the U.S., and Mr. Evans suggested Mr. Rogich talk to Mr. Lay about Enron's woes. Mr. Evans called Mr. Lay, Mr. Lay called Mr. Rogich, and Mr. Rogich says he raised Enron's complaints last month with senior Indian officials, including the powerful home minister, Lal Krishna Advani. Mr. Advani visited President Bush and other officials in Washington this month, but it isn't clear whether the Enron debacle came up during his trip. 
Although Mr. Lay and Mr. Evans spoke about Enron's financial situation at the end of October, the Indian project apparently didn't come up between the two again until mid-November, when Mr. Lay called the secretary at his office to provide "an update" on Dabhol, according to Commerce spokesman Jim Dyke. A couple of weeks later Enron filed its bankruptcy-court petition.

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: LENDERS
2 Early Enron Lenders Didn't See the End Coming
By PATRICK McGEEHAN

01/22/2002
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 3
c. 2002 New York Times Company

Enron's modern era dates back to the mid-1980's, and throughout that period Citigroup and J. P. Morgan Chase have been there to lend with both hands. 
The two giant banks were the biggest lenders to Enron when it collapsed late last year, tacking a painful ending onto long-running and mutually beneficial relationships. Both were also around in the early days of Kenneth L. Lay's tenure as Enron's chief executive: J. P. Morgan Chase helped to finance the merger that created Enron in 1985 and Citigroup helped Mr. Lay pay off a corporate raider a year later.
Over the years, Enron and the partnerships it controlled paid Citigroup and J. P. Morgan Chase, and their corporate predecessors, for a variety of lending, investment banking and insurance services. Last week, Citigroup disclosed that its exposure to Enron easily exceeded $1 billion, making it one of the company's biggest lenders. J. P. Morgan Chase had even more exposure to Enron at the end. 
The ties have been so broad and deep that it is possible one or both of the banks will have made money from Enron even after the big losses they estimated they would suffer. Together, they took more than $680 million in charges against their fourth-quarter earnings to cover potential losses related to the company. 
Officials of both banks declined to discuss details of their relationships with Enron. 
Banking industry executives and analysts are not surprised the nation's two biggest and most aggressive banks were the biggest lenders to Enron, a company so active in deal making that some investment bankers described it as the ''fifth-biggest wallet on Wall Street.'' Indeed, some are not altogether surprised that two giant banks that pride themselves on being smart lenders did not seem to see the Enron debacle coming. 
''Banks have a habit of making mistakes,'' said Henry T. C. Hu, a professor of banking and finance law at the University of Texas. ''There's a long tradition there.'' 
Mr. Hu traced the banks' Enron mistakes in part to the way they are organized and the way they reward employees. In the minds of midlevel bankers, he said, the danger of missing out on doing business with a ''deal machine'' like Enron surely outweighed the risk that the company would implode. 
''When you're talking about making loan decisions and the like, especially when you're confronted with a client that is at least by outward appearance successful and rapidly growing, you as an individual banker hate to be the one who raises his hand and says the emperor has no clothes,'' Mr. Hu remarked. 
The banks' judgment may also have been clouded by the length of their relationships with Enron. Citigroup's bond was forged in 1986, when it helped the company fend off Irwin Jacobs, an aggressive Minnesota investor who was accumulating a big stake in Enron stock. Another financial company, Leucadia National, had bought a smaller stake. 
Enron had been formed in mid-1985 by the merger of Houston Natural Gas and InterNorth. Among the banks providing financing for the deal was one that later became part of what is now J. P. Morgan Chase. 
The presence of the two big investors as Enron stockholders was most unwelcome, coming as it did in Mr. Lay's first year as the company's chairman and chief executive. To fend them off, he and Enron's other directors decided to buy back the shares for more than they were worth, a practice known as Wall Street as greenmail. 
Enron paid $357 million to buy back 7.6 million shares, or 16.4 percent of those outstanding, from Mr. Jacobs and Leucadia. At $47 a share, Enron was buying its own stock at 6 percent above the market price, which had risen on speculation that Enron would be taken over. 
The company resold the shares to a newly created Enron employee stock ownership plan. The plan used $230 million Enron said was left over when it merged the pension plans of Houston Natural Gas and InterNorth. That drew criticism from T. Boone Pickens, another aggressive investor of the 80's who was chairman of Mesa Petroleum. ''Greenmail is a symptom of weak management, and Enron's executives have folded in a big way,'' Mr. Pickens said a week after the buyback. 
To help pay for the shares it bought, Enron borrowed more than $100 million from Citibank, now a unit of Citigroup, and another bank. The assistance that Citibank gave Mr. Lay then formed the cornerstone of the complex relationship between Enron and Citigroup in recent times. 
Citibank has since lent Enron large amounts for everything from working capital to building a power plant in India. Citigroup's investment banking unit, formerly called Salomon Smith Barney, has underwritten bonds the company sold and has advised it on acquisitions. 
Salomon Smith Barney was an adviser to the company on its failed effort to sell itself to Dynegy last fall. The firm also played a role in structuring and raising money for some Enron partnerships and invested more than $10 million of its own money in one named LJM2. 
A spokesman for the firm declined to discuss its role in creating the partnerships. 
Since J. P. Morgan Chase came up with some of the money for the merger that created Enron, the bank has also played several roles in the company's growth. It was the lead manager of a $500 million bond offering in 1999 and co-manager with Salomon Smith Barney on a convertible bond offering last year. 
J. P. Morgan also advised Enron on a series of acquisitions, including several in Brazil. In 1998, it advised Enron on the purchase of a controlling stake in Elektro Eletricidade e Servico, a state-run utility in Sao Paulo. In 1999, it advised a subsidiary, Enron Oil and Gas, on a purchase of its own stock from Enron. 
Despite all those connections and all of the smart investment bankers, commercial bankers and analysts who were charged with closely monitoring Enron's financial condition, the banks are stuck with big unpaid debts. Of all banks, Mr. Hu said, J. P. Morgan was supposed to be too smart for that. 
''What does this say about the quality of their risk management?'' he said. ''Banks have to compete with each other on the basis of their ability to provide good judgment.'' 
J. P. Morgan's pitch, Mr. Hu added, was that it was ''the one bank you could trust, not only unimpeachable but really smart and unassailable in terms of these credit issues.''

Accounting for Enron: Bankruptcy Court Filing Causing Ethical Quandary for Law Firms

Enron Corp.'s filing for bankruptcy-court protection is posing a growing ethical quandary for law firms. 
As Enron's main bankruptcy counsel, for example, New York law firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges stands to earn millions in fees. But another marquee Weil Gotshal client, Arthur Andersen LLP, is rapidly turning into one of Enron's biggest adversaries. Last week, the energy company fired Andersen and is now believed to be considering a suit against its former auditor for malpractice or fraud.
Weil Gotshal says that because it won't be representing Andersen in any matter involving Enron, there isn't any conflict of interest. But the U.S. trustee in the Enron case has asked the law firm to disclose more information about its roster of clients, including Andersen. 
"We are trying to get sufficient information so people can determine whether the interrelationships are conflicts to be concerned about," said Carolyn Schwartz, U.S. bankruptcy trustee in New York. "Disclosure, while not a panacea, at least puts everything on the table." 
The dilemma shows how, like the regulators who once lobbied for Enron, or the politicians whose pockets were lined with campaign contributions from the company, law firms involved in the Enron mess are scrambling to avoid potential conflicts of interests. 
Such problems have become especially acute as law firms have grown and diversified in recent years, with the development of bankruptcy departments, once the purview of specialized legal boutiques, in large, full-service practices. The sheer size of the Enron case has made it almost impossible to find lawyers without some possible conflict. 
As a result, law firms are getting special waivers from clients in order to get a piece of the action. Others are establishing elaborate firewalls to avoid the sharing of confidential information. 
New York's Sullivan & Cromwell, which has done lobbying and commodities-regulation work for Enron, recently got special permission from the company to represent David Duncan, Andersen's former lead auditor on the Enron account, whom Andersen recently fired. 
Davis Polk & Wardwell, one of Andersen's principal outside law firms in the Enron case, is also acting as counsel to one of Enron's biggest creditors, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Christopher Mayer, a Davis Polk partner, said both clients were fully informed and have consented. 
Martin Bienenstock, a Weil Gotshal partner who is heading up the Enron case, said the firm isn't involved in examining any potential claims that Enron may have against Andersen. "All Enron-Arthur Andersen matters will be dealt with by other attorneys," he said. He notes that Weil disclosed that Andersen was and is a client in court documents when Enron filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-court protection in December. He added that the firm expects to make additional disclosures soon in response to Ms. Schwartz's request. 
Among other matters, Weil represented Andersen in connection with a bitter split with its Andersen consulting group a few years ago. The firm earned fees of roughly $11 million in that matter. Its revenue last year was $573 million. 
Ethics rules prohibit law firms from filing a lawsuit against an existing client. Separate bankruptcy-court rules require that lawyers for companies in bankruptcy proceedings be "disinterested." A hearing to consider court approval of Weil, Gotshal as Enron's law firm is set for next week. 
In 1994, Weil Gotshal had its fees slashed by a bankruptcy judge for failing to disclose potential conflicts in connection with its handling of the Chapter 11 case of apparel maker Leslie Fay Cos. The trustee in that case was Arthur Gonzalez, who is now the judge overseeing the Enron case.

Were Auditor and Client Too Close-Knit?

HOUSTON -- Big companies and their outside auditors often have close relationships, but few become as cozy as the ties that developed between Enron Corp. and Arthur Andersen LLP. 
Questions are being raised about whether they were so tight that they hindered Andersen from scrutinizing Enron's books as thoroughly and independently as it should have.
Indeed, the distinctions between the dozens upon dozens of Andersen workers assigned to the Enron account and Enron's own workers were so blurred that many at the energy-trading company's headquarters here couldn't tell the difference. 
Andersen auditors and consultants were given permanent office space at Enron headquarters here and dressed business-casual like their Enron colleagues. They shared in office birthdays, frequented lunchtime parties in a nearby park and weekend fund-raisers for charities. They even went on Enron employees' ski trips to Beaver Creek, Colo. "People just thought they were Enron employees," says Kevin Jolly, a former Enron employee who worked in accounting. "They walked and talked the same way." 
Many Andersen accountants in Andersen's Houston office, one of its biggest, eventually became Enron employees as the energy-trading company sharply increased its hiring of Andersen workers in the late 1990s. While other companies also hire talent from their auditors, so relentless was Enron's hiring that Andersen in the late 1990s grew uncomfortable and discussed solutions, including capping the number of people who could be hired, said a current Enron employee and a former Enron employee. 
Neither Andersen nor Enron will say how many Andersen employees were hired away. An Andersen spokesman declined to comment on such a cap, saying only that "it's not an issue that is addressed in one of our standard agreements" with a client. Enron spokesman Mark Palmer says he was unaware of a cap. 
Andersen's close ties to Enron raise a conflict-of-interest issue, says John Markese, president of the American Association of Individual Investors. Noting that Andersen-Enron relationship evolved into an informal alliance, an unusual arrangement for a Big Five accounting firm to have with a client when it is supposed to keep watch on the books, Mr. Markese notes, "All that closeness goes a long way toward breaking down barriers of independence." 
Andersen, while conceding errors in judgment in its handling of the Enron account, has defended its work, saying that Enron in some cases didn't provide Andersen auditors all the information they needed. Enron fired Andersen last week, days after Andersen officials disclosed that the firm's employees destroyed documents related to Enron's financing arrangements. 
Andersen has drawn fire for signing off on accounting practices related to Enron's partnerships, which allowed Enron to keep debt off its balance sheet and has made it the subject of a federal investigation. Another problem, critics say, is that auditors are reluctant to question their big clients' books too much because they earn such large fees, not just for the auditing work but for nonaudit services, such as consulting. 
Enron paid Andersen $27 million for nonaudit services, including tax and consulting work, compared with $25 million for audit services, making Enron one of its biggest clients. "We would marvel at the amounts of money we were spending" with Andersen, says a former Enron analyst, whose job was to streamline costs. 
Also, documents show that Andersen executives believed Enron's fees to the firm could eventually total $100 million a year, which would have made the energy trader Andersen's biggest client by far. 
Ties between Enron and Arthur Andersen stretch back to the late 1980s but became especially close in 1993 when Enron hired the accounting firm to undertake its internal audit. While that made some Enron employees uneasy, they became even more troubled by the hiring of Andersen employees, among them Richard Causey, Enron's chief accounting officer, and Jeffrey McMahon, the company's chief financial officer. 
"It was like Arthur Andersen had people on the inside," says Judy Knepshield, formerly director of accounts payable at Enron. "The lines became very fuzzy." 
Andersen's Houston office, which employs some 1,400 people out of the firm's total of 85,000 world-wide, was a sort of farm club for Enron. The Andersen employees wore Enron golf shirts, former employees say, and decorated their desks with Enron knick-knacks. 
David Duncan, the Andersen partner in charge of the Enron account, was a Texas A&M University graduate and recruited heavily from A&M for Andersen's Houston office. Many of the recruits landed jobs on the prestigious Enron account and were often hired by Enron itself, current and former employees say. In addition to graduating from Texas A&M, Mr. Duncan sits on the advisory council for the university's accounting department. The tight-knit crowd of A&M graduates "would take care of each other," says one former Enron employee. 
Mr. Duncan last week was fired by Andersen after revelations that he directed the document shredding; Mr. Duncan's attorneys have denied that he did anything wrong. 
Andersen ultimately became troubled by the number of employees it was losing to Enron, Enron employees and former employees say. When the company unveiled its so-called new power project in 2000, for example, it hired all 35 of the Andersen consultants who had helped develop the model, former employees say. 
But the hiring between Andersen and Enron worked both ways. In 1993, when Andersen took over Enron's internal audit operation, 40 people moved from the company's payroll to Andersen. Also in the early 1990s Enron's Thomas Chambers, the energy trader's vice president of internal audit, left Enron to run the Andersen group assigned to Enron's internal audit. 
A former Andersen employee now at Enron says the attitude was that rivals would handle an account of Enron's size similarly, so there wasn't a reason to raise issues. "Another auditor would have done the same thing anyway," the employee says, "So what's the point of losing all that money?"

Routine 401(k) decision became costly flashpoint 
By ALAN BERNSTEIN 
Copyright 2002 Houston Chronicle 

Eleven months ago, Enron began looking for another firm to keep the records of its workers' retirement savings program, a bundle of 401(k) accounts then worth about $1.6 billion. 
What may have seemed a relatively routine decision at the time exploded when the change occurred in October, the point at which Enron collapsed. 
In the aftermath, the change has become a metaphor for class struggle. 
That is: While company officers made hundreds of millions of dollars in recent years selling Enron stock, a 401(k) "lockdown" prevented some 20,000 participants from doing the same when the share price continued a nose dive in the fall. 
The result has been a wave of vivid stories about employees losing their sizable life savings while the bosses cashed in big. The rags-vs.-riches contrast is fueling much of the controversy over the Enron collapse. 
But the story is far more complex. There are two competing versions of what happened, and the truth could lie anywhere in between. 
A lawsuit filed by several Enron workers says the bosses should have told employees more about the real prospects for the company's stock and lifted the lockdown and other restrictions when the stock price fell. Enron counters that such lockdowns are a routine and essential business practice, that the lockdown was, in fact, lifted early, and the changeover followed all federal rules governing 401(k) accounts. 
At Enron, those accounts were similar to those offered by many other corporations. The company contributed 50 cents worth of stock for every dollar of salary -- up to 6 percent -- that workers put in their 401(k)s. 
But the "matching" stock came with a string -- employees could not sell it until they turned 50, when they would be expected to start preparing for retirement. Some companies place no age restrictions on the sale of matching stock, experts say. 
Even so, 89 percent of the Enron stock that workers and ex-workers put into their retirement savings account did not come from the company match, according to the workers' lawsuit. It was stock the employees bought with their own money, and they were free to sell it regardless of their age. 
Thus, about $1 billion of the $1.6 billion total was in unrestricted Enron stock, according to the Gottesdiener Law Firm of Washington, D.C., which represents workers. 
Those numbers indicate many employees were violating theNo. 1 rule of financial planning -- diversify. 
"In the end, the employee has to determine where they put the money, and if they don't follow diversification, anything that comes along can hurt them," said Michelle Miears, a principal in the Houston office of Buck Consultants, which helps employers communicate with workers about benefits. 
But for the workers, Enron was an alluring investment, one that grew in value far more than other options. Their suit alleges that Enron executives also used psychology to get them to buy company stock and later hid the troubling truth about its future worth. 
"It is well-known," the suit says, "that the tendency of the worker to put their own contributions in company stock is stronger when the employer's matching contributions are automatically directed in company stock." 
Even while the stock price declined, Enron Chairman Ken Lay told employees it was vastly undervalued and urged them to buy more. 
Experts agree that there are good reasons why companies match employee contributions with stock rather than cash, starting with the fact that it costs less. 
"If a company is matching in stock, that is because it doesn't have the cash," said Alex Brucker, a Los Angeles lawyer who mostly represents employers in benefits cases and is a fellow of the American College of Employment Benefit Council. 
Matching with stock also allows the company a tax break, gives workers a feeling of ownership and puts stock in hands that are usually friendly in case of a takeover attempt. 
When Enron stock was flying high in early 2001, its 401(k) plan records were administered by The Northern Trust Co., based in Chicago. In February, Enron asked Northern's competitors to bid on the contract to manage the records. 
Employers commonly change plan administrators to obtain better service. That's increasingly important as workers refine their investments daily by telephone or computer, Miears said. 
Indeed, says Enron spokesman Vance Meyer, Enron sought the change to get better value and service for workers. 
Hewitt Associates, based in Lincolnshire, Ill., won the contract around the middle of 2001. Enron says it announced the change in an Oct. 4 letter to employees at their homes and followed up with e-mails. 
The notices included a warning that Enron's 401(k) accounts would be frozen starting Oct. 29 -- meaning no stock sales or other adjustments -- during the switch from Northern Trust to Hewitt. 
Enron said the switch was planned for months and had nothing to do with the fact that onOct. 16, the company announced a $638 million third-quarter loss and $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity. 
But that version of the story, and what happened next, are in dispute. 
The workers' lawsuit says some employees, former employees and retirees who would have sold their stock as the price fell never got the word about the freeze until it was too late, and that others had been told it would start Oct. 19. 
Some workers asked Enron to postpone the freeze when it became obvious that the value of employee-owned stock in the 401(k) was evaporating. 
Enron responded in an e-mail to employees that "we have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July" and "understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition as short as possible." 
Brucker, the employee-benefits lawyer, said such freezes are routine when companies change administrators, but they are often postponed to work out procedural or other problems. 
Enron's switch may have been so far along that stopping it would have been complicated and difficult, he said, "but there are always ways to stop it." 
Hewitt declined comment on why the freeze was not postponed, referring questions to Enron, which also declined comment. 
Enron says it limited the freeze to 10 working days, six days less than expected. 
In the corporation's version, the stock, worth about $82 a share in January and $43 as late as August, was at $13.81 when the freeze began and $9.98 when it ended Nov. 12. 
That means that most of the stock decline that wiped out so much employee wealth took place long before the freeze. Seen another way, however, the stock lost about 28 percent of its value during the period when employees were unable to sell, regardless of whether they had bought it with their own money or got it through the 401(k) match. 
The workers' lawsuit contends that the freeze actually began on Oct. 19, and the stock price lost 60 percent of its value when it ended. 
Besides the 401(k) program, Enron provided workers with a benefit similar to a pension. Employees with the company for at least five years were entitled to 5 percent of each year's annual base salary, plus interest. 
The program is described in documents that every new employee got from the Enron benefits department, whose slogan, repeated on every page of the benefits manual, is "keeping pace with your lifestyle." 

Fight Looms Over Pension-Plan Changes --- Enron's Consequences Lead Legislators to Pursue Tightening Regulations

WASHINGTON -- Businesses, consumer groups and organized labor are gearing up for a battle over efforts to impose new restrictions on retirement plans after Enron Corp.'s collapse, which wiped out the nest eggs of thousands of the company's employees. 
Enron's 401(k) retirement plan was heavily weighted with the company's shares, so when the stock plunged, the value of employees' 401(k) accounts did, too. Making sure that doesn't happen elsewhere is a top priority for many lawmakers as Congress returns tomorrow from a monthlong recess. Already, members from both parties have introduced bills and scheduled hearings.
A massive lobbying campaign is taking shape: The National Association of Manufacturers, which opposes far-reaching restrictions, is offering a primer for member companies on the more-limited reforms it supports. The American Benefits Council, which represents Fortune 500 companies on benefits issues, is meeting with high-level administration officials who are drafting recommendations for President Bush. The council also opposes sweeping regulation. But the Pension Rights Center, a Washington consumer group, believes the government must step in with far more protections for workers. It plans to launch a Web site and media campaign, and is organizing Enron employees to lobby Congress. 
The political pressure makes it likely that Congress or federal regulators will make some changes to the current system. This is "an opportunity to try and get real protections in the law for workers," says Shaun O'Brien, senior policy analyst for the AFL-CIO, which has put pension oversight near the top of its priority list. 
With national midterm elections coming up in November, the Enron case takes on some urgency for politicians, says David Wray, president of the Profitsharing/401(k) Council of America, a Chicago employer group. But "we'd like everyone to slow down here," he says. "Companies have been sharing ownership with employees for about 100 years, and we want to be real deliberative as we think about changes." 
Traditional pension plans -- known as defined-benefit plans because they spell out retirees' income -- are heavily regulated under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, or Erisa. During recent years, growing numbers of employees have changed -- or been shifted by their employers -- to defined-contribution plans, such as 401(k) plans, whose payouts depend on how much an employee invests and which are more lightly regulated. 
One of the first bills introduced after the Enron debacle would impose a 20% cap on the portion of their employers' stock that employees can hold in retirement accounts. The measure also would limit to 90 days the amount of time employers can require workers to hold matching stock contributions; there is no limit in place now. 
Consumer groups like the legislation a lot. The Pension Rights Center, for instance, says it will push the bill, sponsored by Democratic Sens. Barbara Boxer of California and Jon Corzine of New Jersey, and may even seek stricter requirements for employers. The center is planning a grass-roots campaign, teaming up retirees' and women's groups with Enron employees and International Business Machines Corp. workers who are disgruntled about changes to their pension plan, says Karen Friedman, the center's director of policy and communications. 
The Senate bill, and a similar one in the House, alarms the business community. NAM, the manufacturers' trade group, is working with members to lobby lawmakers on pivotal committees, says Neil Trautwein, NAM's director of employment policy. U.S. Chamber of Commerce Chairman Thomas Donohue has been meeting with chief executives of some Fortune 100 companies to help craft their message to Congress, says Kathleen Havey, the business association's director of pension policy. 
Many companies are concerned that legislation could impose too many restrictions on the way they set up and administer their pension plans. General Electric Co., for one, says it imposes few restrictions on investment choices for employee 401(k) plans, yet workers still have chosen to put 75% of their 401(k) assets in GE stock. That is because "returns have been 20% a year in the last five years," GE spokesman David Frail says. "We'd be concerned if, in an effort to shield employees from risk, that legislation would go too far." 
Enron's bankruptcy filing also is giving new legs to old bills, including one that Rep. John Boehner first introduced in late 2000. A new version, which lets pension-fund managers and other fiduciary advisers offer employees investment advice as long as they disclose potential conflicts of interest, passed the House in November as Enron was unraveling. Mr. Boehner, an Ohio Republican, is chatting up the bill, trying to find a Senate sponsor. 
Bush administration officials, including Ann Combs, assistant secretary for the Labor Department's Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration, have backed the Boehner bill, and NAM calls it a "constructive approach." 
AFL-CIO officials, however, are scratching their heads and preparing to fight it. "It's curious Boehner is promoting it in the context of Enron," says Mr. O'Brien, the labor group's senior policy analyst. "Enron is a story of conflicts of interest."

Your Money Matters
Enron Isn't the Only Retirement Tale That Leads to Hard Lesson: `Diversify'
By Ellen E. Schultz and Theo Francis

Enron Corp. workers whose 401(k) balances have evaporated amid that company's bankruptcy may find valuable lessons in a continuing lawsuit brought by former Morrison Knudsen Corp. employees who found themselves in a similar situation. 
For one thing, they will learn that when companies fail, there are stark differences between pension plans and 401(k)s. Pensions are protected, because companies must set aside money to pay the benefits workers have earned. And if the pension plan doesn't have enough money, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., a federal agency, steps up to pay minimum pension benefits.
There is no similar safety net for the 401(k)s, profit-sharing plans and employee stock-ownership plans of companies that go bust. If money in the plan is lost because it was invested in employer stock that becomes worthless, that is tough luck. 
The only hope employees have of recovering their losses is if they can show that the company breached its fiduciary duty by not warning them that the stock was a poor investment. However, even if employees have a valid claim, they probably are still out of luck if the company slides into bankruptcy -- as Morrison Knudsen did, and Enron has -- because the bankruptcy proceedings ultimately could lead a trial court to dismiss the claim. 
The bottom line: To the extent possible, employees should diversify the investments in their retirement plans. Avoiding a concentrated stock position can be difficult when companies contribute their own stock to employee retirement plans. But in these situations, workers shouldn't add to their exposure by buying more company stock on their own, as many Enron employees did. 
Of course, the risk generally is lower when it comes to 401(k)s invested in mutual funds or other independent investments. Though the investments can lose value, their fate isn't tied to that of the company. 
Enron employees suing over losses in their 401(k) plan -- 47% of which was invested in Enron stock at the end of 2000 -- may find themselves in a replay of what happened at Morrison Knudsen, a Boise, Idaho, engineering and construction company that filed for bankruptcy protection in June 1996. During a four-year court battle, the Morrison Knudsen employees have received no compensation for company stock-related losses in their retirement and employee stock-ownership plans. 
In 1994, when Morrison Knudsen announced an unexpected loss, the stock dropped 25% the next day and kept sliding, from its 1994 high of $24 to about $2 on Feb. 19, 1996, when the company announced it would file for bankruptcy. The stock slump decimated the retirement savings of more than 3,500 employees, who had about $75 million invested in a 401(k) and an employee stock-ownership plan. The 401(k) was heavily loaded with company shares because the company's matching contribution was in Morrison Knudsen stock. In addition, employees were encouraged to contribute their own savings to Morrison Knudsen stock, because if they did so the company would match their savings with an equal amount in the ESOP. Both plans required them to hold on to the shares until they were in their 50s. 
Employees got an opportunity to diversify in 1995 when the company lifted restrictions on selling the shares. However, Morrison Knudsen was negotiating with banks to avoid bankruptcy for months before it told employees. Some employees filed suit on July 19, 1997, alleging that the company breached its fiduciary duty to the plan participants because it didn't tell them how dire the company's financial status was. 
John Blyler, an engineer with Morrison Knudsen in Boise for 22 years, had about $35,000 in both the 401(k) and the ESOP before the July 1994 announcement about the company's troubles. He lost most of it. "It's a crying shame," he says. 
Employees also sued members of the board, including Peter Lynch, then a vice president of Fidelity Investments' investment-management arm and a trustee of its funds who also was a director of Morrison Knudsen and chairman of its board's audit committee. Fidelity didn't respond to request for comment. 
When employees sued Morrison Knudsen, the company sought to have them held in contempt of court for bringing the suit, on the grounds that the bankruptcy court already discharged the company from any liability for the retirement plan. While the judge ultimately didn't agree, the employees were frightened. 
"You bet I was scared," Mr. Blyler says. "I lose my job, and my retirement money -- and I get sued." 
In November 1999, the federal district court in Boise ruled that Morrison Knudsen's 1996 bankruptcy reorganization plan had released the company's officers and directors from any obligations to the employees, and also had discharged the company's obligations to the plan. (Morrison Knudsen was acquired by Washington Group International Inc., which itself is reorganizing under bankruptcy-court protection. A spokeswoman for Morrison Knudsen declined to comment.) 
The court didn't dismiss claims against the trustees in the pending case, because they weren't debtors. T. Rowe Price Inc. was trustee for the 401(k), and Mellon Bank Corp. was trustee for the ESOP. Both Mellon and T. Rowe say they were merely custodial trustees, which means they were following the company's orders. T. Rowe says it also had no inkling of problems afoot at Morrison Knudsen. 
Enron employees have sued their employer, as well as retirement-plan trustee Northern Trust Co. and the auditors, Arthur Andersen LLP. Northern Trust, too, says it was a directed trustee without investment authority. "We held the assets and we kept the records," spokeswoman Sue Rageas said. Andersen declined to comment. 
How Enron workers will fare is anyone's guess. Employees sometimes prevail in such suits -- to a degree. ColorTile Inc. employees lost their 401(k) savings in 1996, because the Fort Worth, Texas, company invested 82% of the money in stores that held ColorTile leases. The employees sued and obtained a settlement of $4 million -- $3.1 million from plan trustee Texas Commerce Bank NA and $950,000 from Texas Pacific Indemnity Co., under a fiduciary liability insurance policy. That was a pittance compared with a total of $34 million in the plan. 
Some say the solution to the problems faced by employees at Enron, Morrison Knudsen, Polaroid Corp. and other companies in bankruptcy would be to prevent companies from loading up employee plans with their own stock and locking the employees into it. 
And the bankruptcy code would need to be modified so that if the fiduciaries broke the law, employees could recover money from the reorganized company. "A company in reorganization has profit-making potential, so future earnings ought to be available to refill the retirement plans, should employees successfully bring a case," says Brian McTigue, a Washington, D.C., pension lawyer who is representing the Morrison Knudsen employees.

NEW YORK -- The imbroglio surrounding rules in Enron Corp.'s retirement-savings plan, which prevented employees from selling their stock while the company's fortunes crumbled, is raising new concerns about the "lockdown" practices at scores of other companies. 
Some employees of telecommunications-equipment maker Lucent Technologies Inc. want answers to why the company's 401(k) savings plan was in a lockdown period when the company released financial information that cut its stock price by one-third in just one day.
On Oct. 10, 2000, Lucent said it would miss its previously stated estimates for the fourth quarter. The following day, the value of Lucent stock plummeted, closing down 32%, to $21.25. But the 114,000 participants in Lucent's 401(k) savings plan couldn't act on the news. They happened to be near the end of a 15-day "lockdown" period, in which they couldn't buy or sell assets in their plans, including their plummeting Lucent shares. 
"We were locked in as investors. We couldn't get out," says Paul Rinderle, a 65-year-old retiree of AT&T Corp., whose retirement plan was transferred to Lucent when the Murray Hill, N.J., company was spun off from AT&T in 1996. Mr. Rinderle said he had hoped to cash in his shares a few days earlier, as the stock price was then on the rise. But because of the lockdown he ended up losing $10,000 "in a heartbeat." 
Lucent locked down the plan because it had spun off its 34,000-person business-communications division, Avaya Inc., on Sept. 30. Lucent's plan administrator, Fidelity Investments, needed time to "balance the assets" of the retirement fund, says a Lucent spokesman. That entailed halting all 401(k) activity to make sure the assets between Lucent and Avaya were divvied up properly. The company warned employees of the move on July 28 and Aug. 31, and sent a brochure to their homes on Sept. 9. 
"It's standard required procedure for all major companies to restrict access to a plan when they go through a merger or spinoff," said Lucent spokeswoman Kathleen Fitzgerald, who noted that Lucent's 401(k) plan recently was named the nation's best by Treasury & Risk Management magazine. "We did it for the shortest time possible," she said. At the end of 2000, 17% of Lucent's $11.4 billion 401(k) fund was tied up in Lucent stock, the company says. Lucent also provides its employees with a pension. 
Ms. Fitzgerald said the company received word of the impending shortfall on Oct. 9, and disclosure regulations required that the information be released as soon as possible. 
Lockdowns typically occur when a company switches plan administrators (as in Enron's case), absorbs another firm in a merger or spins off a unit as a separate company. On any one business day, 96 company plans out of 350,000 that have 401(k) plans are in a lockdown, according to new research from the Profit Sharing/401(k) Council of America, a trade group representing employer plans. 
While lockdowns are legal, they have come under greater scrutiny because of losses sustained during a lockdown of Enron employees. (Lockdowns, temporary periods in which no employees can move their investments around, are not to be confused with other restrictions on selling stock. Most companies don't allow employees to sell employer stock the company has contributed to a retirement plan until age 50 or later.) 
Other companies that recently ended plan lockdowns include International Paper Inc. and Dow Chemical Co., which had locked down a plan with 13,500 participants as part of its merger integration with the former Union Carbide Corp. 
Representatives for employer groups say the down time is necessary for the plans to adjust. "These are highly complex systems," said Ed Ferrigno, vice president of the Profit Sharing/401(k) council. He said plan administrators need to freeze 401(k) activity so they can make software upgrades, check legal compliance and in the case of a spinoff, ensure all the right assets are going with the right people. 
Lucent employees had plenty of other time to sell the stock throughout 2000. A series of previous earnings warnings already had sent Lucent shares falling from $77 at the beginning of the year, to a spinoff-adjusted $27.01 at the close of trading on Sept. 27, the last day employees could trade before the lockdown began. When the lockdown was lifted on Oct. 13, the shares had slid to $21.81, a 19% drop from when the lockdown began. (At 4 p.m. Friday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Lucent shares were up 18 cents to $6.69.) 
Still, lawmakers and regulators examining lockdowns could ask why the periods last so long. "It's done by computer; it shouldn't take that long," said Louis Berney, of DC Plan Investing, a newsletter that covers the 401(k) industry. "I think it's inefficiency as much as anything. If the employees' best interests are at heart, it should be done as quickly as possible."

Accounting for Enron: Andersen Also Audited Qwest, Accounting Questions Surfaced

NEW YORK -- Far from Houston where Arthur Andersen's accounting practice was by far the biggest of its peers serving the energy sector, the Big Five firm also was a significant presence auditing the books of emerging telecommunications companies, at least one of which has come under fire in recent months for its accounting practices. 
Allegiance Telecommunications Inc., Level 3 Communications Inc., Global Crossing Ltd., Qwest Communications International Inc., WorldCom Inc. and XO Communications Inc. all use Arthur Andersen as their auditors. None of the companies have felt heat anywhere approaching that of energy-trading firm Enron Corp., which filed for bankruptcy-court protection late last year shortly after restating its earnings going back four years by more than $500 million. But questions have swirled about the financial statements of some of the telecom companies, many of which achieved spectacular growth rates only to see their valuations crater in last year's stock-market decline.
Some of that spectacular growth came by immediately recognizing revenue from one-time, long-term contracts, rather than phasing it in gradually over the life of the arrangements. The biggest questions have centered on Qwest, of Denver. A Morgan Stanley report last spring contended the company tried to boost its earnings through certain accounting moves related to its merger with U S West. Qwest denied it did anything wrong but disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission had raised questions about its merger accounting. It said it answered those questions and the regulators subsequently closed the matter. The SEC has declined to comment. Investors raised more questions in September, when Qwest disclosed a complex contract that worked to boost revenue and meet growth targets; the stock fell to a 52-week low following the disclosure. 
Dave Tabolt, a spokesman for Andersen, declined to comment on any of the particular accounting issues in the telecom sector. He said the firm is aware of clients' concerns generally in the wake of the Enron collapse, saying they "are asking good questions. But when we talk to them, they've been extremely understanding and supportive. People are taking our measure. They want to know we're acting in good faith." 
Representatives of Qwest, WorldCom, XO, Global Crossing and Level 3 declined to comment about whether they are considering switching accountants. Thomas Lord, chief financial officer of Allegiance Telecom, said his company plans to stick with Andersen, which he said "has the highest level of accounting standards. They run Allegiance -- appropriately so -- through the wringer every year." 
Still, some investors interviewed recently said Enron's situation raises the question of whether Arthur Andersen has been allowing its telecom clients to engage in aggressive accounting tactics. "It's a bit of a red flag," said Dean Gekas, a principal for State Street Global Advisors, which owns shares of Qwest. Mr. Gekas said he plans to try and "identify whether or not there's some relaxation of controls going on [at Andersen] that hasn't gone on elsewhere." 
While companies may not dump Arthur Andersen, those companies' financial statements may come under heightened scrutiny -- especially if they faced any accounting questions in the past, said Jay Crandall, managing partner of Oak Hill Capital Management Partners LP, which owns shares of Qwest. Patrick McGurn, vice president of Institutional Shareholder Services, predicted investors "are going to look more closely at Andersen companies, figuring where there's smoke, there's fire." 
On the other hand, "they are probably the best auditor to have now to make sure everything's squeaky clean and to try and heal up their credibility," said Mike Allison, equity research analyst at Eaton Vance Management, which owns WorldCom shares.

Economy
Moody's Trains Eye on Data Off the Sheet

Under mounting criticism for failing to uncover Enron Corp.'s financial demise, a major ratings agency is turning its attention to Wall Street firms and other companies by asking for new information on the off-balance-sheet transactions and other obscure arrangements that could pose financial risks sometime in the future. 
The move by Moody's Investors Service, one of the nation's largest bond-rating agencies, is unusual, according to financial executives at several Wall Street firms who have been contacted by the company. In recent days, Moody's has sent notices to several Wall Street firms asking for new disclosures on "off-balance-sheet financial arrangements," as well as "partnership agreements," "financial contracts" and "agreements with third parties" that are affected by a downgrade in the companies' own bond ratings. After Enron was downgraded, it was forced to immediately accelerate payments on billions of dollars' worth of debt that the company kept off its financial statements.
"As part of our ratings process, Moody's is undertaking a comprehensive review of all ratings triggers contained in any agreements entered into," according to a Moody's notice reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. As part of the review, the agency also wants information on "the amount of debt involved and the possible effect" of these arrangements on the company's own fiscal health. 
Officials at Moody's say the request for information is being sent to as many as 4,200 companies that the firm rates. "It's a significant effort to gather detailed information on something that is very much on the minds of the capital markets," said Fran Laserson, a spokeswoman for the company. Ms. Laserson cited the 1994 bankruptcy filing of Orange County, Calif., as the last time the firm had asked bond issuers for such disclosures. 
But the move comes amid criticism that bond raters like Moody's failed to move quickly enough to spot Enron's deteriorating financial health. With $50 billion in assets, $13.15 billion in debt and billions more in off-balance-sheet debt, Enron's is considered the largest bankruptcy filing in U.S. history. On Dec. 2, the company filed for bankruptcy, but it posted a big third-quarter loss nearly two weeks before Moody's downgraded its bond ratings in late October. 
Over the years, Enron managed to amass billions of dollars in off-balance-sheet debt in partnerships -- a primary cause for the company's troubles -- without major red flags from the rating agencies. "It's good to see the rating agencies finally doing its homework, but unfortunately it comes too late for investors of such companies as Enron" says Lynn E. Turner, former chief accountant for the Securities and Exchange Commission, and professor of accounting at Colorado State University. 
It is unclear how much debt can be found in such off-balance-sheet arrangements, or which companies have the lion's share of such transactions. But a big focus of Moody's appears to be the brokerage sector, which like Enron, has a history of trading derivatives and other securities through these devices. "One big question is: Will the incremental scrutiny change the way business is done?" said one senior executive at a major Wall Street firm. 
Moody's isn't the only organization looking to more closely scrutinize off-balance-sheet arrangements. In recent weeks, the Securities and Exchange Commission, Wall Street's top cop, has begun asking companies to file additional information regarding "off-balance-sheet" items, according to Wall Street executives. An SEC spokeswoman declined to comment on the matter, but the SEC appears to be responding to a request by the nation's largest accounting firms for corporations to "to take immediate steps to improve their disclosures in three critical areas," including off-balance-sheet arrangements.

Credit Markets
Moody's and S&P, Singed by Enron, May Speed Up Credit Downgrades
By Gregory Zuckerman and Christine Richard
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

Moody's and Standard & Poor's, stung by criticism that they were too slow to respond to Enron Corp.'s financial troubles, are considering big changes to enable them to cut credit ratings more quickly. 
While the shift could give investors a better sense of risk -- after all, both credit-rating companies kept Enron at investment grade until just five days before it filed for bankruptcy -- it also could add a new dose of volatility to the stock and bond markets.
Moody's Investors Service is considering making more-frequent ratings changes over a shorter period of time, shrinking the review periods for ratings and eliminating ratings "outlooks," says Christopher Mahoney, chairman of the credit policy committee at Moody's, a unit of Moody's Corp. Outlooks are intended to point toward the long-term direction of the rating over the next several years. 
Mr. Mahoney stressed that nothing has been finalized and that Moody's will soon release a paper on the topic, to be circulated to investors for comment. 
Standard & Poor's Corp., owned by McGraw-Hill Cos., also may take steps to accelerate the speed at which it makes ratings changes. If investor sentiment sours on a company, and its liquidity becomes an issue, S&P analysts may be more likely to cut a rating, rather than wait to see what happens with the company. 
"Criticism creates urgency but it's not Enron alone that's driving the issue of timeliness," said Clifford Griep, chief credit officer at S&P. "The market is concerned with" the speed that ratings are changed. 
A representative of ratings agency Fitch, a competitor of S&P and Moody's, couldn't be reached to comment. 
Until now, ratings agencies usually moved ratings down gradually, one notch at a time, while putting companies on notice that more downgrades may be forthcoming. But stock and bond prices often are down more quickly, making the last ratings-agency move anticlimactic. With the proposed changes, the ratings moves could come more quickly, or a few notches at one time, perhaps getting out ahead of the reaction on Wall Street. 
The credit agencies, like the Wall Street analysts who covered Enron, have been hit by criticism that they didn't cut their ratings fast enough. Critics, though, say analysts often face conflicts of interest that make them reluctant to criticize the companies they cover. While the ratings firms do get paid by the companies they rate, unlike analysts they don't have the opportunity to profit from investment banking or other business tied to the firms -- business that could be hurt by a negative analyst report. 
The trick for the ratings agencies is in balancing the need to warn investors against the potential damage if a rating downgrade triggers an avalanche of trouble for companies already on the edge. 
Even before the proposed changes, analysts say there already are signs that the Enron experience is prompting rating agencies to cut credit ratings more aggressively, especially in the energy sector. 
In late December, for example, Moody's cut Mirant Corp.'s rating by two notches and Calpine Corp.'s rating by one notch, both to Ba -- a below-investment-grade, or "junk," rating. 
In addition, the speed with which Moody's cut Kmart Corp.'s rating last week also drew attention among bond investors. Kmart was rated investment grade by Moody's as recently as Dec. 14. But after a series of sharp rate cuts, including a decline of five notches in under a week, the company is left with a rating of Caa1, a low tier of junk bond. 
Since the Enron bankruptcy, Moody's has announced that it will be more aggressive about alerting investors to the consequences of "triggers" in a company's capital structure. Triggers are events, such as a rating downgrade or a decline in profitability, that require a company to renegotiate borrowing terms with its bankers or accelerate repayment on bank or bond obligations. Such triggers can greatly exacerbate a company's problems by creating liquidity issues just when a company is least able to obtain new funding. 
Enron's various lending arrangements, including those relating to off-balance sheet debt, included a number of such triggers. 
Moody's also has stepped up its focus on off-balance-sheet debt, in light of Enron's problems. A report in yesterday's Wall Street Journal said Moody's in recent days has sent notices to several Wall Street firms asking for new disclosures on "off-balance-sheet financial arrangements," as well as "partnership agreements," "financial contracts" and "agreements with third parties" that are affected by a downgrade in the companies' own bond ratings. 
If the broader changes are implemented by the ratings agencies, investors could benefit. If a company hits tough times and the risks for bondholders suddenly rise, Moody's and S&P will feel free to rapidly slash the company's credit rating. In this way, bond investors will get a better sense of the risks involved in buying the company's bonds, and stockholders will also get a better idea of the company's health. 
But while stock and bond prices already move in anticipation of moves by credit-rating agencies, if the agencies begin cutting and raising their ratings more quickly, it will likely add a new dose of volatility to stock and bond prices. 
"We've had higher volatility on stocks when debt becomes an issue, and bonds already move ahead of the rating agencies," says J. Curtis Shambaugh, a corporate-bond strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston. "But this will add additional volatility." 
Louise Purtle, credit strategist at Deutsche Bank in New York, says the upshot of the Moody's changes would be a "dramatic increase in the volatility of ratings." 
That, in turn, could mean corporations will pay a higher price to tap the debt market. If rating agencies are quicker to move ratings, investors might begin to demand higher rates on corporate bonds relative to safe Treasurys, to compensate them for the higher risk, according to analysts.

The Nation COLUMN ONE Enron Case Raises the Bar in Texas A matter that's big even by the state's usual standards has the legal community in a frenzy, with lawyers hiring their own lawyers and others dodging conflicts.

HOUSTON -- Even the lawyers here are hiring lawyers. 
The astounding collapse of Enron Corp. has devastated employees, infuriated shareholders, stung creditors and awakened the regulators. Everyone's upset. And everyone's headed for court.
"This case is the full employment act for Texas lawyers," said Richard J. Zook, who was the first to file a class-action lawsuit against the energy company, now operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. 
"There will be civil lawyers, criminal lawyers, securities lawyers, regulatory lawyers, bankruptcy lawyers, employment benefits lawyers and trial lawyers," Zook said. "Billions and billions have been lost. It's going be a long, detailed and exhaustive search for the guilty parties." 
So far, 51 lawsuits have been filed in U.S. District Court here naming former Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow as a defendant. Fifty-six go after former Chief Executive Jeffrey K. Skilling. Fifty-three seek damages from Chairman Kenneth L. Lay. Dozens more suits go after the company itself. 
That's not all. Lawyers for Enron's 20,000 creditors are seeking restitution, and a group of Enron bondholders is suing the company's former auditor, Andersen, as well as the bonds' underwriters. 
Samson Investment Co., an oil exploration company that was an Enron partner, sued the auditor last week. Enron itself is making noises about suing Andersen, formerly known as Arthur Andersen. Other lawyers are focusing on the brokers who touted Enron's once-golden stock. Wendy Gramm, an Enron board member and the wife of Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas), has had 14 suits filed against her. 
Texans are fond of their superlatives, so few here are resisting the notion that the biggest bankruptcy filing of all time will spur the largest legal quagmire of all time. Yet that opinion is seconded by more distant observers, who nonetheless caution that the case is still unfolding. 
Resolution in Courts Likely Will Take Years 
"This involves civil actions as well as potentially criminal ones, private as well as public entities," said Stanford University law professor Deborah Hensler. "And it involves lots of money and has lots of political ramifications. Those are the ingredients you'd need." 
The legal actions are likely to go on awhile. 
Given the number of defendants and legal proceedings and "the potential of the criminal cases to delay the civil cases," said San Diego lawyer William Lerach, "it will take as many as six years to resolve this." 
Lerach, who represents shareholders who claim they lost fortunes because of Enron's deception, rejects assertions that the only winners will be lawyers. 
"Lawyers always do well whenever there's a disaster," he said. But he added that class-action lawyers "only get paid if they make a recovery for the class--and they only get paid a percentage of what they recover." 
All the more reason, then, to spread the legal net as wide as possible. The juiciest target could be Andersen, which stands accused of failing to present Enron's true financial picture. The Chicago-based company has deep pockets and, unlike Enron, is not shielded by U.S. Bankruptcy Court. 
Marvin Isgur, a Houston bankruptcy lawyer, estimated that at least 40 Houston firms were involved in the case. Others, like Isgur himself, were talking to potential clients. 
"Everyone that touched Enron is going to need legal advice," he said. 
Although Enron lawsuits are being launched all over the country--the bankruptcy case is being heard in New York, and the Samson complaint was filed in Tulsa, Okla.--by far the greatest concentration is here, in the energy company's hometown. 
The cases are so plentiful that questions are starting to be asked about conflicts of interest, and the lawyers themselves are wondering what their own best interests are. Sooner or later, everyone is going to have to take sides. 
In the good old days, there was only one side for Houston lawyers. Everyone sat on charity boards with Chairman Lay, shopped at the Galleria, lived in swank River Oaks and dined on the truffle-scented baby hen at Tony's. 
"The royalty of Houston were either Enron bosses or on the board of Enron," said Gerald Treece, associate dean at South Texas College of Law. 
The tight relationships--and Enron's big footprint in this town--are leading to conflicts. Two of the 18 U.S. District Court judges here, Nancy Atlas and David Hittner, had to recuse themselves from Enron cases. An Atlas assistant said the judge would not comment; an assistant to Hittner said his decision was prompted by his ownership of Enron stock. 
Their cases were assigned to U.S. District Judge Lee H. Rosenthal, who disclosed last month that she had "long-standing friendships" with two defense lawyers. One of former CFO Fastow's lawyers was godfather to one of Rosenthal's children, the judge said in a court filing. Another lawyer representing Enron defendants was best man at Rosenthal's wedding. The judge said she was "fully capable of disregarding these relationships." 
Ten days ago, without explanation, Rosenthal recused herself from her 46 Enron cases. 
"The problem is Enron is everywhere and Enron executives are everywhere," said Elizabeth Freeman, a lawyer for Enron creditors. "Most of the judges were practitioners here. They might have represented Enron or an Enron competitor." 
Cases Consolidated Into 3 Categories 
Underscoring that point, the U.S. attorney's office in Houston, which was conducting a criminal investigation of Enron, was recused from the case Jan. 9 by the Justice Department, in part because staffers are related to Enron employees. 
For instance, U.S. Atty. Mike Shelby's brother-in-law worked for the energy company. Because many Enron employees are bitter over the collapse of their company savings plans, there was the possibility the government lawyers would be accused of seeking vengeance instead of justice. 
Although the number of lawyers is multiplying, the number of active cases is shrinking for the moment. That's because they are being consolidated on three tracks: employee benefits, shareholder class actions and so-called derivative suits, in which shareholders sue a corporation's officers to force them to restore to the company money they allegedly stole from it. The docket sheet for the class-action suit Newby et al vs. Enron Corp. takes 15 pages to list all the lawyers involved. 
Yet for all of the frantic legal activity, there's a sense that this might only be the beginning. 
"We haven't gone to Defcon 1 yet," said Treece, the law school dean. "When Enron filed for bankruptcy, it scared a lot of lawyers away. They thought the chance of getting big money evaporated." 
Some have a different reason for staying away. 
"One thing about Texans, they think loyalty means something," Treece said. 
By spreading its work around, Enron bought a lot of loyalty in the Texas legal world. This is a trick the law firms seem to have learned themselves. When Vinson & Elkins, Enron's main law firm, was named as a defendant in two of the class-action lawsuits, it promptly sought out Joseph Jamail, the most famous litigator in Texas, to represent it. 
Jamail won a $10.5-billion verdict in 1985 against Texaco for his client Pennzoil, a case that was the previous high-water mark for Texas litigators. He did not return a call to comment, but anyone expecting him to take on Enron in similar fashion is likely to be disappointed.

Accounting for Enron: Company's Swift Collapse Reverberates Throughout Political Circles in Texas

Political repercussions from Enron Corp.'s collapse are beginning to be felt in its home state of Texas, where the chairman of the state's Public Utilities Commission, a former Enron executive, resigned because of his ties to the company. 
Max Yzaguirre, who headed Enron's Mexico operations, was named to the Public Utility Commission in June. The next day, Gov. Rick Perry received a $25,000 donation from Enron Chief Executive Kenneth Lay. The governor, a Republican who replaced President Bush, has said the timing was coincidental.
Mr. Yzaguirre's appointment had become an issue in the governor's race and he cited the intensity of the debate in his resignation letter. Candidates vying for the job have repeatedly criticized Mr. Perry, who is running to keep his job this fall, for making the appointment. 
As it did in Washington, Enron, based in Houston, and its employees lavished Texas politicians and lobbyists with millions of dollars of donations. Mr. Perry received $212,000 from Enron during the last two election cycles, second only to former Gov. George W. Bush among state officeholders, according to Texans for Public Justice, a nonpartisan group that tracks campaign donations. 
Attorney General John Cornyn, a Republican candidate for governor, earlier this month withdrew from his office's inquiries into the company. Mr. Cornyn received $183,000 from Enron during the last two election cycles. 
Some -- but only a few -- Texas politicians are returning Enron money or donating it to charity, including Comptroller Carole K. Rylander and Greg Abbott, a former state Supreme Court justice and candidate for attorney general. Both are Republicans. 
Enron and its employees gave more than $1 million to state candidates and political action committees during the 1998 and 2000 elections and paid lobbyists as much as $4.8 million, according to Texans for Public Justice. State lawmakers say the company's top legislative priorities were to deregulate the state's electricity markets, which became law Jan. 1, and exempt old power plants from tougher emission controls, another successful effort. 
Enron also has been one of the biggest contributors to state judges, who run in partisan elections. Texans for Public Justice says Enron gave $134,058 to state Supreme Court justices since 1993, including $97,358 to seven of the nine current justices. 
The Supreme Court sided with Enron in five of six cases it handled involving the company since 1993, the group says. 
Enron's large lobbying force -- its 15 Texas lobbyists were paid between $535,000 and $945,000 total last year -- allowed the company to better argue its positions with lawmakers, said state Rep. Pete Gallego, Democratic chairman of the House General Investigating Committee. Still, he added, "My perception is they got nothing concrete other than access." 
Democratic Rep. Steve Wolens said that Mr. Lay was a forceful advocate of free markets but that his lobbyists were less successful negotiating details of deregulation. For example, legislators rejected an Enron-backed proposal to award retail customers to energy companies via a lottery, he said. 
Mr. Wolens said that the state's accounting regulator accepted his petition to investigate whether Arthur Andersen LLP and accountants at Andersen, which was Enron's accountant, and Enron violated state auditing standards. Violating accounting standards can lead to a loss of one's license to practice in the state.

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE POLITICIANS
Enron Spread Contributions on Both Sides of the Aisle
By DON VAN NATTA Jr.

01/21/2002
The New York Times
Page 13, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

WASHINGTON, Jan. 20 -- Senator Joseph I. Lieberman embodies how the Enron Corporation's collapse has tied the capital in political knots. 
Already, Mr. Lieberman, the Connecticut Democrat who will strike the gavel on Thursday to open the new year's first Congressional hearing on Enron, has been buffeted by criticism from both sides of the aisle for his stewardship of one of the many Congressional committees investigating Enron's spectacular fall.
Republicans complain that Mr. Lieberman should recuse himself because his former chief of staff, Michael Lewan, was a lobbyist for Enron. Others have raised questions about campaign donations to Mr. Lieberman and political groups close to him from Enron and its accounting firm, Arthur Andersen. And some fellow Democrats are expressing dissatisfaction that Mr. Lieberman, who harbors presidential aspirations, has not made the Bush administration his prime target. 
The bipartisan criticism of Mr. Lieberman reflects how deeply Enron, its campaign money and its deregulatory agenda have become imbedded in Washington's money culture these last dozen years. 
Like many Fortune 100 companies, Enron, a Houston energy-trading company, spread largess all over Washington. Although it gave more money to Republicans, it gave plenty to Democrats, too, including Senators Charles E. Schumer of New York, Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico and John B. Breaux of Louisiana. 
Enron has written campaign checks to three-fourths of the senators, and nearly half of the members of the House. Perhaps because of those donations, Democrats and Republicans have promised to aggressively investigate Enron's financial problems and their impact on thousands of employees for fear of looking soft on the company. 
''They are all living in a glass house,'' Mary Matalin, the counselor to Vice President Dick Cheney, said of lawmakers on Capitol Hill. ''How far are they going to go with guilt by contribution?'' 
Everyone agrees Enron's decision to seek bankruptcy protection, the biggest in American history, is a corporate scandal. While most politicians say it has the classic elements of a political scandal, too, they insist it is still too early to declare it one. Many elected officials on Capitol Hill are proceeding cautiously as they embark on lengthy and complicated inquiries. 
''I think they are being cautious because they don't know all the facts,'' a Republican strategist, Charles Black, said. ''This is a very complex thing. And there is no evidence that any elected official or government official did anything untoward. So they are right to be cautious.'' 
Mr. Lieberman was asked by a legal watchdog group to recuse himself because a group he co-founded, the New Democrats Network, had received $25,000 from Enron. Critics have also pointed out that Citigroup, Enron's largest lender, is Mr. Lieberman's top donor, giving his campaigns $112,000 since 1997, campaign records show. A longtime Republican strategist put it this way, ''Lieberman's problem is simple -- Enron's biggest creditor is his campaign's biggest contributor.'' 
For his part, Mr. Lieberman has promised to conduct a fair and thorough inquiry that will not become ''a witch hunt.'' 
Enron, Arthur Andersen and Vinson & Elkins, a Houston law firm, are among the most generous contributors to Mr. Bush's 2000 presidential campaign. Enron has given more than $700,000 to Mr. Bush since 1993; no company has given him more. In addition, Enron's chairman, Kenneth L. Lay, was one of the ''pioneers,'' raising more than $100,000 for Mr. Bush's campaign, and he and his wife gave a total of $10,000 to Mr. Bush's Florida recount fund. Enron and Mr. Lay also contributed a total of $200,000 to Mr. Bush's inaugural festivities. 
While Enron's accounting problems worsened last September, Mr. Lay continued to raise money for candidates. He was host of a luncheon for Elizabeth Dole, who is running for United States Senate from North Carolina, at the Four Seasons hotel on Sept. 20. The event raised about $20,000 for Mrs. Dole's campaign, but she has pledged to donate Mr. Lay's contribution -- about $5,000 -- to the Enron employees' fund. Other candidates, lawmakers and campaign committees are busily returning Enron donations. 
The Congressional panels are focusing on the reasons for Enron's collapse. They intend to investigate an array of issues, including retirement fund management, the oversight of energy trading markets and financial accounting and auditing. 
The Senate Government Affairs Committee, whose chairman is Mr. Lieberman, will look at whether regulators could have done more to monitor the company's practices. The House Energy and Commerce Committee, led by Representative Billy Tauzin, Republican of Louisiana, has been the quickest out of the gate, with an investigation focusing on Enron and Arthur Andersen. Last week the committee released a letter from an Enron vice president, Sherron S. Watkins, that warned Mr. Lay last August about enormous losses and possible illegalities in several Enron partnerships. 
Mr. Tauzin received campaign money from Enron and Arthur Andersen, but committee investigators have aggressively sifted through more than two million documents. 
Congressional committees have sent out hundreds of subpoenas, causing concerns among Justice Department lawyers who say they are worried that key executives at Enron and Arthur Andersen may compromise any future prosecutions. 
The hazard lies in any grant of immunity to the witnesses testifying before any of the Congressional committees investigating them. Prosecutors would then have to show they did not use any of this testimony to find witnesses or to gather evidence against them. 
This hurdle for the government became clear in 1991, when an appeals court reversed a conviction in the Iran-contra case of John M. Poindexter, the former national security adviser, and caused the independent prosecutor to drop all charges against Oliver L. North, saying prosecutors would not be able to show that the testimony used to convict Mr. North had not been affected by his testimony to Congress. 
Brian Sierra, a Justice Department spokesman, said, ''We're not going to comment on potential trouble down the road. We're aware of the need for Congressional oversight. We are going down the road of a criminal investigation. We'll work with Congress on this issue. If a problem presents itself, we'll work those problems out.'' 
On the political front, Representative Henry A. Waxman of California, the ranking Democrat on the Government Reform Committee, has posed questions about Enron's contacts with several administration officials, including Mr. Cheney and Lawrence B. Lindsey, the president's economic adviser. But the committee chairman, Representative Dan Burton, Republican of Indiana, does not intend to hold hearings on Enron, a spokesman for Mr. Burton said. 
The Congressional inquiries will focus mainly on accusations of corporate malfeasance, but investigators for several of the committees looking into Enron's political contacts can be divided into three general areas of inquiry, President Bush, Vice President Cheney and Texas legislators. 
At a White House question-and-answer session with reporters, the president said that Mr. Lay had supported his opponent, Ann Richards, when he ran for governor of Texas in 1994. It is true that Enron had given money to both sides, but Mr. Lay and Enron gave more than three times more money to Mr. Bush than to Ms. Richards. 
For years, Mr. Bush affectionately called Mr. Lay Kenny Boy, but recently at the White House the president referred to him as Mr. Lay. 
In response to questions from Mr. Waxman, the vice president's counsel revealed that in 2001 Mr. Cheney met once with Enron executives and members of his staff four times to discuss energy policy. 
Mr. Waxman released a report that identified 17 areas of the administration's energy plan, drafted by Mr. Cheney's task force, that had also been advocated by Enron. 
Ms. Matalin, Mr. Cheney's aide, said that none of the provisions were given to the administration by Enron. 
''Just because someone endorsed it, doesn't mean someone put it in there,'' she said. ''This is just good energy policy.'' 
Enron's financial problems have reignited a push for Mr. Cheney to release a list of people who met with the energy task force last year. The White House has declined to release the list. The General Accounting Office will decide next month whether to go to court to require the administration to release it. Ms. Matalin said the administration was withholding the list ''on principle'' to protect the participants' privacy. 
Representative Tom DeLay, whose district is in Houston and its suburbs, near Enron's headquarters, received $28,900 since 1989 from the company. 
Enron also hired as lobbyists two influential members of Mr. DeLay's inner circle, Ed Buckham and Karl Gallant. And Enron and Mr. Lay were also contributors to the Republican Majority Issues Committee, a group close to Mr. DeLay. 
The Enron dealings of Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, and his wife, Dr. Wendy Gramm, a member of the Enron's board of directors and former head of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, have also drawn scrutiny because of their involvement in regulatory issues affecting Enron. 
But Enron also gave $42,750 to Representative Ken Bentsen and $38,000 to Representative Sheila Jackson Lee, both Texas Democrats.

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: FIVE UNCERTAIN YEARS
A Bankruptcy Freezes The Settlement of Claims In a Puerto Rico Explosion
By MIREYA NAVARRO

01/21/2002
The New York Times

c. 2002 New York Times Company

SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico, Jan. 20 -- To this day, Ruben del Valle said, he battles depression and insomnia. One day, the 73-year-old shoe salesman said, he came home so sullen he took his revolver and locked himself in his garage for half an hour, until a group of relatives, neighbors and police officers lured him out to safety. 
Justina Rivera said her family was not doing much better. Her 37-year-old daughter is ''like a zombie,'' she said, and is under psychiatric treatment. Ms. Rivera herself spent much of last month's holiday season secluded in her bedroom, she said.
Ms. Rivera lost a 31-year-old daughter, and Mr. Del Valle lost his boss and three co-workers, in a 1996 explosion at a shoe store here that killed 33 people, injured 80 others and dealt an economic blow to a major commercial hub. And, in lawsuits, they and hundreds of other plaintiffs blame the Enron Corporation for the blast. An Enron wholly owned subsidiary, the San Juan Gas Company, was found by federal investigators to have failed to prevent the tragedy because of inadequate employee training and unsafe conditions in its propane gas pipeline system. 
Now the explosion's victims, already reeling from human as well as financial losses, are feeling the ripple effect of Enron's enormous financial collapse. Enron's bankruptcy case has frozen settlement negotiations and the first scheduled trials for hundreds of them, plaintiffs' lawyers say, threatening payment of some of the most serious claims. 
Nearly 800 plaintiffs -- more than half of the more than 1,400 who filed about 500 lawsuits against six Enron-related companies and other defendants in both federal and Puerto Rican courts over the explosion -- have settled their suits, according to bankruptcy court papers filed by Enron lawyers. The settlements, which the Enron lawyers said had been covered by indemnity insurance, total about $60 million, plaintiff lawyers estimated. 
But more than 700 plaintiffs still have pending claims that their lawyers and other parties in the case said could reach another $50 million in payments. Pedro J. Saade, Ms. Rivera's lawyer, said the number of claimants in the case was high because it included people who were passing through the area at the time and who are seeking damages for emotional distress. Also, he said, in Puerto Rico, relatives or friends of those affected directly can sue if they, too, can prove to have suffered harm. 
Among the many victims hurt by the fall of Enron, these litigants have a particularly emotional claim against the company -- they hold it and its subsidiary accountable for not only financial loss but for wrongful death, personal injury and post-traumatic stress disorder. 
''I feel like these people have no conscience, that for them this meant nothing,'' said a tearful Ms. Rivera, who filed her lawsuit in 1997 and has found the settlement offers given to her so far to be inadequate. 
When her daughter, Maritza Ramos, was killed in the Humberto Vidal explosion -- named after the shoe store where it occurred -- she was entering the store with her 4-year-old and 3-year-old daughters, Ms. Rivera said. Survivors described a scene similar in certain horrific details to the World Trade Center catastrophe: structures transformed into a mess of twisted metal, dazed people covered in dust, bodies strewn about. 
The two girls survived, Ms. Rivera said, and they and their father have filed a separate legal action. 
''I'm not selling the death of my daughter,'' Ms. Rivera said, ''but I believe there should be just compensation for my other two children, who are destroyed. It's been five years. How much longer are they going to keep us reliving this agony?'' 
In 1997, the National Transportation Safety Board, which handles gas pipeline safety, determined that the probable cause of the November 1996 explosion, which occurred in the basement of the Humberto Vidal six-story store and office building in the Rio Piedras section, was propane gas that leaked from San Juan Gas's underground pipeline system. In the seven days leading up to the explosion, the board said, the gas company had responded repeatedly to complaints from building occupants of a strong gas odor, but its workers failed to find the gas leak. 
The safety board's report found fault with Enron for failing to ''oversee adequately'' the operation of its San Juan subsidiary. (It also faulted the Puerto Rico Public Service Commission and the United States Transportation Department for lack of oversight.) The report said that the company ''did not oversee employees' actions enough to identify and correct unsafe practices'' and that it had known for more than 10 years before the explosion that its gas subsidiary did not comply with pipeline safety requirements and recommended industry practices. 
The report said, ''Enron Corp. had begun before the explosion to correct some deficiencies in the gas company's operations, but its attempt was neither timely nor sufficient.'' 
Enron disputed the findings and did not admit responsibility for the explosion. A spokeswoman for San Juan Gas said at the time that the transportation board had not found forensic evidence showing that the explosion was attributable to propane. 
But in 2000, San Juan Gas, other defendants in the case and the plaintiffs agreed not to litigate the cause of the explosion and instead to proceed with the cases to determine damages and the size of awards. 
Among the suits waiting for a trial date is that of Humberto Vidal, which is claiming $25 million in compensatory damages for the explosion. The business, which was the target of lawsuits itself over the incident, paid $900,000 toward settlements and lost five employees, one store and its corporate headquarters in the explosion. It had to demolish the structure, which has been replaced by a smaller, two-story commercial building. 
Humberto Vidal Jr., vice president of the family business, said that the chain was still operating in the red because of the negative publicity and that Enron and San Juan Gas had made matters worse by disputing the safety board's findings and fighting the suits for years, only to agree later to pay damages. 
Calls to Enron's lawyers handling aspects of the explosion-related litigation in both Puerto Rico and Houston were not returned. A company spokesman, John Ambler, confirmed some background information, but he said the lawyers were not at liberty to discuss the case. 
The explosion plaintiffs can be compensated by Enron's insurance liability coverage, say their lawyers. The lawyers have filed a petition with the United States Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan, asking that the pending cases be allowed to go forward. 
The lawyers say the insurance coverage applicable to their case is about $600 million, more than enough to settle the rest of the suits. 
But in an objection filed with the court earlier this month, Enron's lawyers opposed the move as a distraction from the company's bankruptcy reorganization efforts. 
They said it would be a precedent that could attract other claimants without giving the company ''a reasonable opportunity to develop an overall strategy for processing these claims.'' They also said the applicable insurance coverage called for the insured to pay first and then be indemnified by its insurers, a point that is disputed by some of the plaintiffs' lawyers. 
A hearing on the matter is set for March 7. 
The timing of Enron's collapse could not have been worse for the Puerto Ricans. Five years after the explosion, the first trials had been scheduled for last month. 
Some lawyers are reassuring clients that this is just a temporary setback, but there is enough uncertainty for some to be worried. At the very least, said Jorge Ortiz Brunet, a lawyer here who is handling 30 of the cases, the suits will be delayed further, and Enron will probably be less willing to settle and more eager to go to trial because it no longer fears staining its name. 
''We're in a dark tunnel,'' said Jose J. Torres-Escalera, one of Mr. Vidal's lawyers. ''Nobody knows for certain if anyone will ever recover damages. Each day it gets worse. Enron could end up in total bankruptcy.'' 
Some plaintiffs, like Maria Teresa Otero Soto, 28, seem indifferent to what happens. She said that the one pursuing the case was really her husband, a plaintiff in her suit who alleges ''loss of consortium.'' 
Ms. Otero Soto, a 22-year-old student at a beauty school near the shoe store at the time of the explosion, said she had walked out uninjured but could not erase from her mind the carnage she had seen. 
But many other plaintiffs are more passionate about their claims, convinced of the negligence of Enron and its San Juan company. 
''This will always stay with me,'' said Jose Santiago, 36, a San Juan Gas worker who was testing for the gas leak at the time of the explosion and who is now a driver for a Head Start program at half his old salary. No longer, Mr. Santiago said, can he bear the sound of hissing gas.

Enron's Woes Revive Debate On Campaigns
By ALISON MITCHELL

01/22/2002
The New York Times
Page 16, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

WASHINGTON, Jan. 21 -- The Enron debacle is proving to be an unexpected windfall for the effort to overhaul the nation's campaign finance laws. 
As politicians scramble to return contributions from Enron, the failing energy trading company, the advocates of limiting money in politics say their cause has been reinvigorated. They predict that once Congress returns on Wednesday, they will swiftly gain the support needed to force the campaign finance issue to the House floor.
''It's a huge development,'' said Representative Christopher Shays, the Connecticut Republican who, with Representative Martin T. Meehan, Democrat of Massachusetts, is a leading sponsor of the bill to ban the unregulated and unlimited contributions to political parties known as soft money. 
Tales of Enron's largess -- the company spread $6 million across Washington and both parties in the last decade -- come just as the drive to overhaul the campaign finance law is at a juncture, promising the possibility of the most wide-ranging change in it since the Watergate era. 
The re-energized push for an overhaul will still meet stiff resistance from Republican House leaders, who have stalled the bill and support a less stringent measure. 
The campaign finance issue is not the only one affected by Enron. Enron's collapse could alter the debate over energy legislation, retirement legislation and even the negotiations on an economic stimulus bill. 
The Senate approved an overhaul of campaign financing last year, after years in which the bill died in Republican filibusters. The bill would ban soft money and rein in advertising by advocacy groups. 
In the House, the legislation has stalled. Its backers have been in a petition drive to push their bill to the floor for debate over the objections of the House Republican leadership. By December, they had 214 of the 218 signatures needed to prevail. 
Now Representative Corrine Brown, Democrat of Florida, says she will sign, in part because of Enron. ''To me, this is the people's House,'' Ms. Brown said in an interview. ''The influence that the big dollars have, we need to limit it.'' 
Representative Richard E. Neal, Democrat of Massachusetts, has promised to provide the final signature if 217 other members sign. That leaves the coalition backing the measure just two votes short. 
John P. Feehery, a spokesman for Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, said he was not sure whether the Enron situation had changed the political outlook for the measure. 
''Enron's a different subject, really, from campaign finance,'' Mr. Feehery said. 
Mr. Hastert would have to permit a vote on the bill if the petition drive succeeded, he said, adding, ''Obviously, the rules of the House require you to follow the rules of the House.'' 
Mr. Hastert remains opposed to the Shays-Meehan bill, and with the House whip, Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, who has been an implacable foe of the bill, he has been promoting alternative legislation sponsored by Representative Bob Ney, Republican of Ohio. 
An array of advocacy groups -- including Common Cause, the League of Women Voters and the Sierra Club -- have been running phone banks for the past week to put pressure on a target list of 25 House members to sign the petition. 
Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House minority leader, said at the Democratic Party's winter meeting over the weekend, ''We are going to clean up politics in this country once and for all.'' 
Mr. Gephardt's aides say he will personally press Democratic holdouts to deliver the last signatures for the petition. 
Legislation similar to the Shays-Meehan bill passed the House in previous years, so there is optimism among the bill's backers that if they can get the legislation to the floor they will win passage. Other House members say the vote will be close. 
For the many Republicans who contend that a ban on soft money would weaken the national political parties and abridge free speech, the Enron situation is galling. They contend that the phone calls of the Enron chairman, Kenneth L. Lay, to President Bush's senior aides and cabinet members this fall did not bring help for the collapsing company. 
''If anything, Enron shows that money doesn't buy special influence,'' said Representative Thomas M. Davis III, who heads the House Republicans' re-election committee. 
But John Weaver, a strategist for Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican who put the battle against special interests at the center of his losing presidential run, compared the current frenzy to the one that swept the Capitol after President Bill Clinton pardoned Marc Rich, a fugitive commodities trader, whose former wife, Denise, was a major contributor to Democrats. 
''Just like the Marc Rich pardon changed the environment a year ago and helped secure passage in the Senate,'' Mr. Weaver said, ''we feel the washing of Enron money all around Washington will do the same thing in the looming House debate.'' 
Indeed, so toxic have the Enron donations become that all four of the Congressional campaign committees are returning contributions they received -- either to the company or to funds that have been established to help employees who have watched their retirement savings dry up. 
Three of the committees -- those for the Senate Democrats, the Senate Republicans and the House Republicans -- received $100,000 apiece from Enron this fall, as the company's fortunes rapidly fell. The fourth, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, received $2,050. 
Individual lawmakers, too, are racing to return money. Enron wrote campaign checks to nearly three-fourths of the senators and half the representatives over the years. 
The Democrats are seeking to use Mr. Bush's close ties to Mr. Lay to underscore their theme that Republicans stand with special interests. The Republicans say they are prepared to fight back with their own choice examples of Democratic connections to Mr. Lay, like the case of Thomas F. McLarty III, the Clinton White House counselor who monitored the progress of an Enron power plant project in India; in 1996, just days before India approved the project, Enron gave $100,000 to the Democratic National Committee. 
The charges and countercharges will keep the issue of political contributions alive, which is what the advocates of change want. 
''In all the years of lobbying on this issue,'' said Meredith McGehee, senior vice president of Common Cause, ''we're used to having to go out and make the case that this is a problem.'' 
''Now,'' Ms. McGehee said, ''you go out there and people make the case to you.'' 
Even if the coalition gets 218 signatures on its petition -- a majority of the House -- there are still ways for Republican leaders to delay a vote. 
Under the complicated rules for such a petition, the legislation it forces to the floor can be considered only on certain Mondays. Often the House is not working on Mondays. So the debate could be delayed until April or May. 
Once the Shays-Meehan bill goes to the floor, it will be subject to efforts to amend it and will have to compete against rival bills.

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE ANALYST
Man Who Doubted Enron Enjoys New Recognition
By JOHN SCHWARTZ

01/21/2002
The New York Times
Page 8, Column 5
c. 2002 New York Times Company

HOUSTON, Jan. 20 -- Of all the Enron mementoes, John Olson might have the best one. Mr. Olson, an analyst who has been a longtime skeptic of the energy company's once-stratospheric stock price, has a handwritten note that the Enron chairman, Kenneth L. Lay, sent last June to Mr. Olson's boss, Donald Sanders. 
''Don -- John Olson has been wrong about Enron for over 10 years and is still wrong,'' Mr. Lay wrote. ''But he is consistant [sic]. Ken.''
Consistently right, actually. Mr. Olson, who follows the energy industry for a small investment firm here, has finally been proved correct where just about every other Wall Street analyst who followed Enron was wrong. But he can take only a grim kind of satisfaction in his prescience. ''I would like to be able to gloat,'' he said, ''but this thing is just too damaging, too unhappy, to do anything like that.'' 
Mr. Olson, who calls himself an old-fashioned analyst who does not own individual stocks himself, is now a Houston celebrity. A recent talk he gave at the Petroleum Club on the fall of Enron drew a standing-room-only crowd. 
''He's a very sharp analyst,'' said George P. Mitchell, founder of the Mitchell Energy & Development Corporation in Houston. ''When you have 16 out of 17 analysts'' promoting the stock, he said, ''that's pretty tough opposition. But he stuck to his guns, and he did it early.'' 
Mr. Olson's moment in the sun comes at the end of a lonely time. Wall Street, he said, was dazzled by Enron's high-technology gloss, and did not scrutinize the business. That, he said, has been the sad trend of the analyst community during the years of the dot-com bubble, when companies with no profits and few prospects of earning them could get glowing reviews from analysts like Henry Blodgett of Merrill Lynch and Mary Meeker of Morgan Stanley. 
''Henry Blodgett might be a nice young man, but . . .'' he said, trailing off into silence. 
''On Wall Street,'' he said, ''the worst thing you can be is a schnuckel,'' which he said was the Yiddish word for dupe. ''We were schnuckled on Enron,'' he said. ''It was gloriously overvalued.'' 
His rough command of Yiddish -- the likely word he was referring to was ''schnook'' -- came from his adolescence in Larchmont, N.Y., where he said the fathers of Jewish girls he dated used choice Yiddish terms to insult him. ''Yiddish is a marvelously slanderous language,'' he said. 
A sardonic man, six feet tall, thin and weathered, he looks like a Giacometti statue in pinstripes. He describes himself as ''a basset hound with a 25-watt personality.'' 
After receiving an M.B.A. from the Wharton School of Finance at the University of Pennsylvania, he worked as an analyst covering the oil, gas and electric power industries for firms including Merrill Lynch, Drexel Burhnam Lambert and First Boston. He is currently director of research for a boutique firm here, the Sanders Morris Harris Group. 
His small corner office, on the 31st floor of one of Houston's many downtown office towers, has a splendid view of Enron Field, the city's new baseball stadium. The wood-framed note from Mr. Lay hangs near a wire sculpture of an oil derrick and a silver yo-yo. 
The note was scrawled in the margins of a story from U.S. News & World Report in which Mr. Olson was quoted as saying, ''They're not very forthcoming about how they make their money.'' He went on to say: ''I don't know an analyst worth his salt who can seriously analyze Enron.'' A messenger delivered the note from Mr. Lay the next day by hand. 
When Mr. Sanders, his boss, showed him the note, Mr. Olson recalls shrugging. ''You know that I'm old and I'm worthless,'' he said, ''but at least I can spell 'consistent'.'' 
In Houston, opposing Enron was a little like being against the city itself, said Stephen L. Klineberg, a professor of sociology at Rice University. ''You could make a case that it was especially hard in Houston to be a skeptic on Enron,'' he said, because ''Ken Lay and Enron were very much at the center of Houston's sense of positioning itself for success in the post-oil age'' of trading and high technology. 
The cost of such pessimism could be high, Mr. Olson said. ''They are a very combative culture over there,'' he said. ''They always played to win.'' 
Those who did not join the chorus of praise for Enron, he said, could be punished. ''There was a strong mandate, unwritten, unspoken, at Enron that if you the investment banking house ever wanted to do business with Enron, your analyst had to have a strong buy on the stock,'' he said. ''I was continually at war with investment bankers.'' 
His consistency, however, has not been complete. He did recommend Enron stock when its troubles first drove the price down to $27 a share last September. ''I thought it was a real bargain at the time,'' he said. The slide, of course, continued as Enron headed toward bankruptcy. 
Surprisingly, he does not believe that Enron is finished. He said that he believes Enron can, and should, recover because of its trading prowess. ''They were the best of the breed,'' he said. ''Trading did not bring them down. It was a rogue financing operation.''

The Outlook
Enron Fallout May Cut Stock Prices in General
By Steve Liesman

01/21/2002
The Wall Street Journal
A1
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

New York -- Are all investors -- even those who didn't hold the stock -- paying for the collapse of Enron Corp.? 
That's the question that some economists are pondering as they try to figure out whether the bankruptcy filing of the country's seventh-largest company has broader market implications.
The $63.39 billion failure (judged by the assets in its most recent quarterly report) itself is small potatoes for an economy the size of the U.S., where 2001 gross domestic product exceeded $10 trillion. In fact, the value of Enron's business equaled about 55 hours of output for the entire nation. 

But more widespread economic loss could show up in a more indirect way: through a loss of investor confidence that lowers stock prices. In theory, equity prices reflect a built-in premium that varies depending upon the perceived level of risk. The higher the risk perception, the lower the security price to allow for greater returns. "If investors think financial information is somehow distorting and not portraying the underlying economics of a company, common sense says they will exact a premium," says Jim Leisenring, a U.S. member of the International Accounting Standards Board. 

The most obvious additional risk is that investors now have a new notion of how large is large enough to be considered immune from bankruptcy. Enron's bankruptcy filing is almost as large as the two next biggest failures combined: Texaco Inc. in 1987 ($35.89 billion) and Financial Corp. of America in 1988 ($33.86 billion). There's more risk because the size of a company that is "too big to fail" has suddenly become larger, says Peter Bernstein, president of Peter L. Bernstein Inc., an economic consultant to institutional investors. 
Enron's collapse is unique in the way it has so publicly and comprehensively highlighted risk for investors in every part of the market's supposed safeguards. "The Enron debacle has relevance beyond just Enron," says Byron Wien, senior investment strategist at Morgan Stanley. "It has made investors more apprehensive about investing and part of the malaise the market has experienced in the last several weeks is a reflection of that." 
Internal company memos show that the board and the office of Chairman Kenneth Lay approved the off-the-books partnerships that ultimately led to Enron's fall. Twice the company waived its code of ethics to allow Enron's former chief financial officer to head several of these partnerships. So add some risk for the integrity of executives and directors. 

Revelations that Arthur Andersen was aware of the partnership structures, acted as both external and internal auditor and shredded documents have made even the most skeptical investors rethink what little faith they placed in accountants. There's even a joke among traders that the next great investment play will be shorting a basket of stocks audited by Andersen. So add some risk for the integrity of the accountants. 

A look back at the reports from stock analysts before the company's downfall makes clear that the stock analysts, supposedly highly qualified in corporate finance, didn't understand much of the way Enron earned its money and kept debt off its balance sheet. Worse, even after Enron's problems came to light, several analysts from top investment banks continued to recommend the stock while acknowledging the enigma had yet to be fully unraveled. Lehman Brothers analyst Richard Gross called Enron a "strong buy" while noting that as a result of an "opaque business, a complicated balance sheet and low returns on capital Enron trades as a matter of faith." So add some risk for the financial acumen of stock analysts. 
It has also become apparent that the Financial Accounting Standards Board, which sets the accounting rules, has been working for 20 years to create a simple standard for disclosing these off-the-books transactions. But because of pressure from corporate interests and accountants, it hasn't succeeded. And it's now known that the Securities and Exchange Commission gave Enron waivers from two regulations that would have prompted detailed financial disclosures. So add some risk for the regulators. 
That doesn't leave much for investors to rely upon. 

To be sure, all of these problems have surfaced in scandals past. And there are those who argue that Enron is an isolated incident because it was the only company of its kind: a utility company creating new markets for electricity and broadband trading that engaged in sophisticated finance. 

But is that really so unique any more? Corporate balance sheets increasingly look like those of financial institutions, with the use of derivatives, vendor financing loans, third-party equity stakes and stock options. In fact, because of the way companies use stock for employee compensation and, in the case of Enron and others, to guarantee corporate obligations, stock has transformed from a reflection of management's performance to a tool of management to enhance performance. So now, investors must judge whether managers are good widget makers and good bankers and investors. "As the firm becomes more complex," says Roger Ibbotson, finance professor at the Yale School of Management, "we are less able to understand easily what goes on." 
And if investors can't trust the directors, executives, accountants or analysts to come up with good numbers, then everyone will pay a price -- or rather, a lesser price for stocks.

Steel's Shakedown Attempt Will Test Bush's Resolve
By George Melloan

Democrats and the New York Times have been trying mightily to establish some guilt-by-association link between George W. Bush and those hapless tycoons at Enron. Not much luck there. Ken Lay called the government for help but the Bush administration didn't answer. 
Now, there is another tycoon on the phone yelping for a taxpayer bailout. If George Bush decides to gratify his demands, there will be no complaints from the Dems. Quite the contrary. The tycoon is U.S. Steel CEO Thomas J. Usher and he will have plenty of Democrats backing him up. Indeed, the spokesman for his lobby is former Clinton press secretary Joe Lockhart.
Mr. Usher's demands on the American taxpayers are limited, but only in the sense that a limited amount of water flows over Niagara Falls every day. All he wants is for the federal government to take over the retiree pension and health insurance obligations of the big integrated steel producers, so that U.S. Steel can buy up its competitors free of those burdens. That will only cost $12 billion or so, admittedly cheap compared to what it might have took to make Enron whole. 
But there's another demand, for new tariffs of up to 40% on 16 types of imported steel. That one gets a bit expensive. It will raise the price of steel to U.S. manufacturers, making them vulnerable to further market inroads from foreign competitors. It also will raise the hackles of U.S. trading partners, giving them justification to retaliate against U.S. products. 
The European Union has just won a World Trade Organization ruling allowing it to punish the U.S. with $4 billion in trade sanctions until the U.S. abolishes foreign sales corporations, exporters exempted from corporate income taxes. Europe doesn't much want to retaliate, because it would raise prices in Europe, and there is an important question of what business the WTO has deciding tax policy, anyway. Europe might be willing to call it quits if the U.S. chooses to forego any new steel tariffs. If the U.S. gets such an offer, it should take it. A nasty issue with the potential of further gumming up trade relations could be swept under the rug, with benefits all around. 
But will the Bush administration stand up to Big Steel? Various political advisers argue that refusing the industry's demands might cost Republicans control of the Congress next fall. A collapse of the richly rewarding retirement benefits system granted by the companies to the United Steelworkers Union in fatter times could sow discontent in places like Indiana and Pennsylvania. Republican congressional candidates could lose in these and other "battleground" states. 
Mr. Usher's argument is that if the industry can get this bailout, it can consolidate and make itself more competitive against big competitors in Asia and Europe. He is seconded by Bethlehem Steel CEO Robert Miller, Jr., whose knowledge derives from his role in arranging the 1980 government rescue of Chrysler Corp. The idea is to meld Bethlehem, a Chapter 11 bankrupt, with U.S. Steel and some other failing integrated producers, like National and Weirton. But that can't happen, they say, unless the government assumes their worker retirement obligations, which represent a cost that in some cases is higher than the value of the companies themselves. The government also would have to waive antitrust objections, but that would be no big deal. 
With this help, it's claimed, the U.S. could have one big happy integrated producer and all would be well. But is that really true? The U.S. government has been protecting steel companies for decades through import quotas and the like, and the result has been a worsening of the industry's sickness. The integrated producers start with a cost disadvantage in that they maintain the expensive blast furnaces that convert iron ore into pig iron to be converted into steel. So-called minimills, which use electric arc furnaces to smelt scrap, can make steel much cheaper and have been taking over more and more of the market. Many foreign producers, unburdened with expensive labor contracts like those the Steelworkers have won, can undersell as well. In a market where demand hasn't grown significantly for years, the integrated producers are the odd man out. 
Yet the real issue before the Bush administration is whether it wants to continue taking extreme measures to keep this crippled industry on its feet, or whether it wants to cut its losses. If the busted mills simply liquidate, retired steelworkers won't go hungry. The younger ones have recourse to the government's Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. and indeed are still of working age. The older ones also have access to Social Security and Medicare. That's not to say they would suffer no loss, but is it really fair to ask taxpayers who have survived on much less generous pay and benefit packages to support steelworkers at their present levels? 
More to the point is the example a steel bailout sets for industry in general. Does the Bush administration want to establish a precedent that the government will assume the obligations of every declining industry in an attempt to arrest that decline? One of the great strengths of the American economy has been its adaptability. The promise of a bailout simply tells managers and workers they won't have to adapt to changing market circumstances. More insidiously, it tells them that they can get through politics what they couldn't get through hard work and adroit management of their enterprises. 
The worst effect of all is what bailouts say to the rest of the world. They say that the great proponent of free trade has feet of clay. The Bush administration is striving hard to preserve America's free trade bona fides by asking Congress to restore the President's fast-track authority to negotiate trade agreements that Congress must vote up or down, without crippling amendments. That authority is essential if the new round of trade negotiations launched by WTO trade ministers in Qatar last fall is to bear fruit. 
Reductions of trade restrictions have been the engine driving the growth of the world economy since the Kennedy Round was launched in the 1960s. It has allowed many millions of the world's people to move from a subsistence existence into the cash economy and to rise out of poverty to income levels that provide them with creature comforts and human dignity. This is not a small thing to risk for the meager returns that will result from keeping a small group of U.S. companies on life support for a few years longer.

The Urge to Punish Cheats: It Isn't Merely Vengeance
By NATALIE ANGIER

01/22/2002
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 4
c. 2002 New York Times Company

Over the last couple of weeks, as the Enron fiasco has played itself out like a louche fusion of Shakespeare and the old ''Dewey, Cheatum & Howe'' routine, Americans have been transfixed by the story, united in a nearly seamless sense of outrage. 
Regardless of whether any laws were broken in the spectacular collapse of one of the nation's largest companies, citizens of all political pipings have voiced disgust at accounts of top Enron executives selling off their stock in time to enrich themselves handsomely, while ordinary Enron employees were later forced to sit by in impotent desperation as their retirement savings evaporated.
In the ferocity of the public outcry, and the demand from even those with no personal stake in the Enron collapse that ''justice'' be done, some scientists see a vivid example of humanity's evolved and deep-seated hatred of the Cheat. The Cheat is the transgressor of fair play, the violator of accepted norms, the sneak who smiles with Chiclet teeth while ladling from the community till. 
Human beings are elaborately, ineluctably social creatures, scientists say, and are more willing than any other species to work for the common good -- to cooperate with nonkin and to help out strangers, sometimes at great cost to oneself, as the death of hundreds of rescue workers at the World Trade Center only too sadly showed. 
Such a readiness to trust others, to behave civilly in a crowd, to share and empathize, to play the occasional Samaritan -- all the behaviors that we laud and endorse and vow to cultivate more fully in ourselves -- could not have evolved without a corresponding readiness to catch, and to punish, the Cheat. 
Only recently have researchers realized that a willingness, even eagerness, to punish transgressors of the social compact is at least as important to the maintenance of social harmony as are regular displays of common human decency. And while the punitive urge may seem like a lowly and unsavory impulse, scientists point out that the effort to penalize cheaters is very often a selfless act. 
In an article titled ''Altruistic Punishment in Humans,'' which appears in the Jan. 10 issue of the journal Nature, Dr. Ernst Fehr of the University of Zurich and Dr. Simon Gachter of the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland offer evidence that people will seek to punish a cheat even when the punishment is costly to them and offers no material benefit -- the very definition of altruism. The researchers propose that the threat of such punishment may have been crucial to the evolution of human civilization and all its concomitant achievements. 
''It's a very important force for establishing large-scale cooperation,'' Dr. Fehr said in a telephone interview. ''Every citizen is a little policeman in a sense. There are so many social norms that we follow almost unconsciously, and they are enforced by the moral outrage we expect if we were to violate them.'' 
Dr. David Sloan Wilson, an evolutionary biologist at the State University of New York at Binghamton, said, ''People are used to thinking of social control and moralistic aggression as forms of selfishness, and that you must be punishing someone for your own benefit. But if you look at the sort of punishment that promotes altruistic behavior, you see that it is itself a form of altruism.'' 
In their new work, Dr. Fehr and Dr. Gachter put 240 students through a series of ''public goods'' experiments with real monetary stakes, always a good incentive for cash-strapped young scholars. 
Each participant was given an initial lump sum of 20 ''monetary units'' and allowed to play a series of games with rotating groups of three other participants. By the rules of the game, the members of each group independently decided how much of their sum to contribute to a community project, which in turn determined how much would be divvied up to participants in the end. The more generous each contributor, the better the group did as a whole, but there was always the risk of a participant's trying to freeload off the contributions of others. 
From one round to the next, students were kept apprised of the investment decisions by others in their group. In some cases, there was nothing they could do about their teammates' behavior. In other cases, though, participants were allowed to ''punish'' freeloaders and skinflints after the round was through: one monetary unit from them would cost the shirker three monetary units. Hence, cooperators had to pay out of their own pocket to express their disgust at another's selfish behavior. 
The outcome of the study was striking on two fronts. One was the popularity of punishment when it was permitted: 84 percent punished defectors at least once, 34.3 percent took punitive action five times or more and almost 10 percent punished the stingy 10 times or more. And all this, remember, involved the doling out of mad money from people who really needed it. 
The second significant result was that when the game was carried out under no-punishment conditions, cooperation among group members quickly broke down, and participants contributed progressively less to the public kitty as the rounds went on. But when the opportunity to punish and be punished was applied, individual contributions to the collective fund jumped sharply, and cooperation among group members grew stronger rather than weaker from round to round. 
The researchers also asked participants to describe their feelings toward free-riders on a seven-point scale, from ''no big deal'' to ''very angry,'' and about 84 percent ranked themselves a five or higher. A sense of emotional outrage is very easily evoked, said Dr. Fehr, and sometimes it feels almost good to indulge and stoke it. 
Perhaps part of the reason it feels good to rail against the sinner is that not to do so seems irresponsible, if not cowardly. ''Once you think of punishment as a form of altruism, then the kind of person who doesn't punish emerges as a kind of freeloader too,'' said Dr. Wilson, author with Dr. Elliott Sober of ''Unto Others: The Evolution and Psychology of Unselfish Behavior.'' 
The emotional palette behind the effectiveness of social control is a rich one, composed not only of a sharp sense of moral indignation and a fear of being punished, but embarrassment and shame when one violates social norms. 
Dr. Wilson said that when he and his children, nonbowlers all, recently went bowling, they were mortified when others gently scolded them for failing to observe common bowling etiquette, like taking turns with bowlers in neighboring lanes. ''My ears were burning with shame, and we fled as soon as we could,'' he said. 
And sometimes the severity of the emotion far outstrips that of the transgression. Dr. Fehr cited a case during the oil crisis of the 1970's that led to long waits at gas stations, when one motorist shot another to death for attempting to butt into line. Some of the most odious of human behaviors, including torture, public stonings and lynchings, may all be examples of the meting out of altruistic punishment run amok. 
The drive to punish selfish transgressors seems to be a basic human predilection. Paradoxically, it stems from something normally associated with rosy-eyed utopianism: according to most anthropological evidence, traditional hunter-gatherer societies have always been highly egalitarian. 
In such cultures, there are no kings or commanders, and the bounty of a good hunt or forage is generally shared with the entire community. If one person doesn't like or trust another, the person may walk away, or articulate that distrust with the tip of a spear. 
''Hunter-gatherer societies are scrupulously egalitarian, but not harmoniously so,'' said Dr. Herbert Gintis of the University of Massachusetts, a co-author on a commentary that appears with the current Nature research report. ''They're violently egalitarian.'' 
Despite its antiquity, the strength and expression of the urge to scourge is clearly shaped by culture. Anthropological studies by Dr. Fehr, Dr. Gintis and others have shown considerable cross-cultural variation in the ardor with which people seek to punish shifty noncooperators. As a rule, said Dr. Fehr, the more closely a society's economy is based on market rather than kinship ties, the more prevalent the use of altruistic punishment to bring others into line. 
In other words, the more likely a person is to be negotiating with nonrelatives, and hence the higher the chances that selfish freeloaders will seek to infiltrate the system, the more important it becomes that everybody play by the rules. Or else.

Commentary Enron Got Its Money's Worth Look no further than the national energy plan.

One of the major falsehoods being bandied about by apologists for the Bush administration is that while Enron may have bankrolled much of the president's political career it got nothing for those bucks once George W. occupied the White House. 
That is nonsense.
The administration's energy program, developed by Vice President Dick Cheney in secret meetings--six of them with Enron officials--could have been written by lobbyists for the now failed company. 
At the behest of Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Los Angeles), the minority staff of the House Committee on Government Reform has prepared a devastating analysis of 17 major concessions made to Enron that gave Kenneth L. Lay, Bush's intimate friend and Enron chief executive, just about everything he wanted. The report concluded that "it is unlikely that any other corporation in America stood to gain as much from the White House plan as Enron." 
Those Bush administration concessions to Enron included finishing the job of deregulating the electricity market begun by Bush's father. The senior Bush's actions had paved the way for the company's meteoric growth. 
George W.'s energy plan also made it even easier for Enron to sell energy derivatives in the commodity market and pursue other financial shenanigans that had been a major source of profit. The unregulated selling of energy derivatives, an Enron specialty, was celebrated in the Bush energy plan as "sophisticated and customizable." We now know that practice was so sophisticated that it was the major source of Enron's paper profits. 
Oddly, given that Republicans are presumed to favor leaving power with the states, the Bush energy plan emphasized increased federal power over utility pipelines that forced local utilities to carry Enron's product. This was an expansion of the "open access" powers granted in the 1992 Energy Policy Act, passed in the first Bush administration. That law undermined the power of local authorities and regional utility companies for the benefit of Enron. In 1999, Enron had defined "open access" as the company's "single-most important initiative." 
Two years later, George W. delivered. Fortunately this subversion of the political process had a short life because Enron went belly up before Bush could save the company from itself. 
But the question remains why Bush, as governor and president, wanted to foist the example of such a despicable corporate player upon the American people as a model for business behavior. 
Surely the Enron alums who occupy key positions in the administration knew that the president's model corporation had avoided paying federal income taxes for four out of the past five years. 
Enron even claimed $382 million in government refunds. How dare this president collect taxes from ordinary Americans after touting a company that created 881 offshore dodges to avoid taxes. Few taxpayers can open subsidiaries in the Cayman Islands pretending to do business, but Enron had more than 700 there. 
The IRS and Treasury Department under the Clinton administration had attacked the use of such tax dodges and attempted to eliminate them. Bush, however, sought to reward a company that, far more than any of its competitors, took advantage of offshore loopholes. Dynegy, Enron's lead competitor, had no offshore tax havens, suggesting that it is possible to do business honestly. 
But how would Bush know of his pet company's chicanery, his apologists howl--particularly the talk radio right-wingers who spent eight years skewering Bill Clinton over the most minor transgressions? Bush should have known because his top economic advisor, Lawrence B. Lindsey, who was paid $50,000 in 2000 for consulting work for Enron, went straight from that gig to being head of the White House's National Economic Council. In the latter capacity, Lindsey wrote a rosy report on Enron's emerging problems and presented it to the president shortly before the company's collapse. 
Were he and the other Enron alum who hold high positions in the administration lying to the president, or did Bush not want to hear any bad news about his once-favorite company? Either way it smells.

Re "Donations Could Taint Probe on Capitol Hill," Jan. 18: Perhaps the politicians, instead of puffing up like indignant bullfrogs over the "outrage" of victimized employees and retirees, should place all of their Enron political contributions in a fund to assist those victims. 
This would clear the way for a reasonable public review of the problem without accusations of conflict of interest. Also, they might be more inclined to freeze the assets of the perpetrators, "pending investigation," if they didn't feel so spotlighted by their own ethically questionable, even if perfectly legal, gains.

Re "Enron: A Scandal So Good That It Hurts," by John Balzar, Commentary, Jan. 18: The culpability for the Enron-related crimes also rests with a majority of average U.S. citizens, who admire (or did) people like Ken Lay as American heroes of commerce. Maybe after the U.S. press wakes up and exhibits more courage (a column like this is a start), so too will enough U.S. citizens. 
Before we can begin to demand more accountability from politicians, we have to take a hard look at the rot that has taken hold in our culture. Then, after we begin electing accountable politicians, they will in turn enforce more accountability and transparency in U.S. business culture. At least for a while, until the pendulum swings back (again) to our current free-for-all business ethics.

Balzar seems to imply that greed and avarice are phenomena of the 21st century (and of the Bush administration in particular). He appears to be suffering from an extreme form of historical myopia. He apparently has forgotten the market crash of 1929, the robber barons of the Progressive era and any number of financial and moral scandals that have been a part of this country's history from its inception. 
But this is not to imply that American history alone is typified by these events. It is a characteristic of the history of human events in general. I am by no means endorsing this behavior or excusing it. I agree with Balzar that the current moral and ethical climate in our country is a sad state of affairs. I only take issue with his implication that we have somehow fallen from some mythical state of grace and that this fall is somehow tied to the current Republican Bush administration.

Of the three congressional investigating committees, 51 of 56 members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, 49 of 70 members of the House Financial Services Committee and two-thirds of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee all received campaign contributions from Enron. 
If ever there were a justification for campaign finance reform, this is it. To quote Balzar, "Maybe, finally, at long bloody last, things will get bad enough to make them right."

Re "Enron Could Have Used 'Can't Do' Advisors," Commentary, Jan. 17: George Will has produced a list of excuses for Enron that rivals the tobacco industry's effort at debunking science. His article represents a compendium of talking points to be used by Republican spin central. By the time this is over the Republicans may well need special help defending their central doctrine of getting the government off of the back of business and deregulation.

Thinking Things Over: I'm OK, You're OK! Enron's OK?
By Robert L. Bartley

01/21/2002
The Wall Street Journal
A13
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Not even the most ardent advocates of capitalism claim it can abolish pride, greed and the rest of the seven deadly sins. Sinners do get flushed out by recession, however, and we find that Enron, a darling of the mid-1999 to mid-2000 blowout, was a house of cards. Maybe, though the jury is not yet even impaneled, a crime. 
Such spectacles are occasion not only to pursue the miscreants but also to keep the larger picture in mind. For all of human failing, capitalism as an economic system has emerged triumphant from the long trials of the 20th century, providing the developed world once unimaginable prosperity and, not so incidentally, historically unprecedented personal freedom.
As we try to prevent another Enron, it will pay to keep in mind that the success secret of capitalist economies is decentralized decision-making. When a multitude of buyers and sellers meet in a marketplace, the vagaries of human judgment even out, facts prevail and true values are reached. Over the centuries since the first money-changers, this principle has been applied to wider and wider economic spheres, reaching its highest expression in today's international financial markets, directing the investment of capital around the world. 
Capital markets are particularly good at funding innovation, providing investment in promising ventures where government technology priming consistently picks losers. Market-driven economies also have great recuperative power; far from buckling from the shocks it has received over the last year, the U.S. economy has stabilized and is probably already recovering. Too, advanced capitalism has developed mechanisms, pension systems and mutual funds in particular, for sharing the bounty through a deep middle class. Peter Drucker has observed that with shares of big corporations predominantly held in pension funds, workers do own the means of production, just as Karl Marx wanted. 
Results can of course be disrupted by market imperfections, for example when one buyer or seller knows things others do not. Perhaps also by the passion of the crowd, though as history unwinds "bubbles" and "panics" often turn out to have rational explanations after all. Whatever the exceptions, though, year in and year out market-determined decisions outperform even the best-informed and most brilliant individual mind. 
A capitalist economy does not arise spontaneously from the anarchy of piracy and war. Government plays an absolutely essential role in establishing a rule of law, protecting property rights, enforcing contracts and providing sound money. But it is also true that over history the greatest threat to property is government itself, acting through immoderate taxation, stifling regulation and even outright seizure. 
These minefields suggest some care in designing arrangements to head off human folly; the system works because people are allowed to fail, indeed to make fools of themselves. It will not be an advance if we charter some group of brilliant and well-informed mandarins to head off human folly. In reality, worse, the mandarins would soon be marching to the tune of some or another batch of politicians feeding this or that narrow constituency. 
How then to curb the seven deadly sins? Surely the law plays a part, and as we learn about the inner workings of Enron venality seems more and more likely. If it comes time to indict, I hope prosecutors will not rest with a safe case turning on some never-before-enforced provision Congress in its wisdom has declared a felony. To satisfy what's on everyone's mind, they need to see whether they can make the case that top executives set out to steal from their shareholders. 
What is particularly disturbing about Enron, though, is that failures run far beyond individual executives. Directors suspending their ethical guidelines to allow self-dealing partnerships. Accountants and lawyers studiously looking the other way, even to the point of personal jeopardy. Wall Street analysts failing in their principal duty of correctly evaluating share prices. This systemic failure is being blamed on "conflicts of interest," an explanation that strikes me as, well, jejune. 
The systemic failure is not a matter of economic arrangements, but of the societal collapse of standards and morality over the last three decades or so. As a society we seem increasingly incapable of sitting in judgment of each other -- certainly not on the behavior of prominent entertainers, sports figures or presidents. We have a legal profession that tolerates and even promotes abuse of the legal system in class action suits -- in the current Microsoft claims settlement enriching lawyers while not even trying to give a cent to supposedly injured plaintiffs. What kind of behavior can an "I'm OK, you're OK" society expect from its professionals or business leaders? 
Since accountants are bearing the first wave of recrimination, a few special words: They're vulnerable because their exercise is so artificial. The "earnings per share" figures they grind out and argue over have only a vague relation to economic success and market value. Another of Peter Drucker's insights is that "profit" is best defined as that portion of cash flow the government has decided to tax. Dividends are not a tax-deductible cost, for example, though in economic terms they are interest on the capital shareholders have advanced. 
Thus any good economic principles course will distinguish between accounting profits and economic profits. On the latter, mainstream economists take one of two views: Some follow Frank Knight, seeing profits as the reward for bearing uncertainty. Others follow Joseph Schumpeter, seeing profits as the reward for innovation -- the monopoly return to an original product, quickly vanishing as imitators arrive. One way to look at Enron's problem is that its economic profits went away, and it sought to substitute accounting profits. 
It's fine to close this particular barn door, to crack down on obscure financial footnotes, to have more rules against conflict of interest. But the seven deadly sins do not ultimately turn on economic arrangements. The real answer to Enron is likely to be found in, say, the little sermons on vice and virtue that make William J. Bennett so tiresome to our I'm OK, you're OK sophisticates.
