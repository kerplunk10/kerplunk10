I looked up 'pansy ass bitch' in Webster's and I was surprised to see a reference to Ricky Mihali.  We had people play last night that could barely run, yet you can't show up or even try to get yourself a sub because of a little 'pussy elbow'.  Maybe if you saw how Ernie's entire hamstring turned purple after he severely strained it last week you would feel bad about not playing.  He showed up and hobbled around the field for us.  I can't walk without pain in my knee, but I showed up.  I had to catch and bat left handed cuz I couldn't put any weight on it, but I showed up. Hell, John probably would have tried to play if he thought it would help the team.  I'm not going to talk to you for a few days...maybe three.  You are lucky we dragged dutch out of retirement last night.  Thanks again for playing last night Dutch.  Nice 3 wood shots!!!!!!!

 Or at least 20%% of her is. How do *we* know? She just took
 TheSpark's famous BITCH*TEST.

 So what about *you*? Is it true that you blame everyone but yourself for
 your problems?

 Your bitchiness seems dangerously high, but there's only one way
 to know for sure:

	  Take the BITCH*TEST
	  http://www.thespark.com/bitchtest

 Take the test, discover your inner (or outer) bitch, and then
 check your score against Rebecca Misetr's and all your other friends'.

When I stand up for myself and my beliefs, they call me a bitch.
When I stand up for those I love, they call me a bitch.
When I speak my mind, think my own thoughts, or do things my own way,
they call me a bitch.
Being a bitch means I won't compromise what's in my heart.  It means I
live my life MY way. It means I won't allow anyone to step on me.
When I refuse to tolerate injustice and speak up against it, I am
defined as a bitch.
The same thing happens when I take time for myself instead of being
everyone's maid, or when I act a little selfish.
I am proud to be a bitch!  It means I have the courage and strength to
allow myself to be who I truly am and won't become anyone
else's idea of what they
think I "should" be.  I am outspoken, opinionated, and determined.
By God, I want what I want, and there is nothing wrong with that!
So try to stomp on me, try to douse my inner flame,
try to squash every ounce
of beauty I hold within me. You won't succeed. And if
that makes me a bitch, so be it.
I embrace the title and am proud to bear it.

hey culo. well, i looked up "fag" on websters and it had a picture
of you sucking jerry's balls you homo.  i informed you guys that i
needed to rest my elbow and would not be able to play softball
last week.  that was plenty of time, it wasn't like i bailed out
at the last minute you pillow biter.  if i cannot even hold a
pencil when my tendinitis acts up then i really do not want to
take a chance with it, so deal with it.  even so, i called kevin
after i heard your message (but inadvertently erased it) and told
him i would play if the games were late and you really needed me.
never mind the fact that i had a ton of work to do and i was up
until 3:00 am doing that work; yet i still said that i would go
out there. i applaud you for batting left-handed, since it
couldn't have been any worse than you batting right-handed. as far
as not speaking to me for three days why not make it more?  it
really doesn't bother me.  if you're going to insult me at least
know how to spell my name mr moolknar it's spelled m-i-h-a-l-y.

that could barely run, yet you can't show up or even try to get
yourself a sub because of a little 'pussy elbow'.  Maybe if you
saw how Ernie's entire hamstring turned purple after he severely

showed up and hobbled around the field for us.  I can't walk
without pain in my knee, but I showed up.  I had to catch and bat
left handed cuz I couldn't put any weight on it, but I showed up.
Hell, John probably would have tried to play if he thought it
would help the team.  I'm not going to talk to you for a few
days...maybe three.  You are lucky we dragged dutch out of
retirement last night.  Thanks again for playing last night
Dutch.  Nice 3 wood shots!!!!!!!

You asked for it, now you got it 5 days with no speaking to the MAHAITY man.  That doesn't mean I can't send nasty emails to you.  You would think that a week would be long enough to replace you, but finding someone equal to  your talent is not easy.   Maybe if you worked out instead of playing that stupid game of tennis, you wouldn't get 'pansy', err I mean ''Tennis elbow'.  Do I need to remind you that you are under contract and don't get paid for non-softball related injuries. (Alou)  You really need to stop the after hours trading.  Try to get your work done during normal trading hours.  Wow that sounds like something stupid a boss would say.

Later Bitch

Math Homework 

A little boy was doing his math homework. He said to himself, "Two plus five, that son of a bitch is seven. Three plus six, that son of a 
bitch is nine. 
His mother heard what he was saying and gasped, "What are you doing?" 
The little boy answered, "I'm doing my math homework, Mom." 
"And this is how your teacher taught you to do it?" the mother asked. 
"Yes," he answered. 
Infuriated, the mother asked the teacher the next day, "What are you  teaching my son in math?" 
The teacher replied, "Right now, we are learning addition." 
The mother asked "And are you teaching them to say 'two plus two,  that son of a bitch is four'?" 
After the teacher stopped laughing, she answered, "What I taught them was  two plus two, THE SUM OF WHICH, is four.'"

ARE YOU A BITCH????? 
Some friends were sitting at the bar talking about their professions. 
The first guy says "I'm a Y.U.P.P.I.E, you know.... 
Young, Urban, Professional, Peaceful; Intelligent; Ecologist" 
The second guy says "I'm a D.I.N.K, you know.... 
Double Income, No Kids." 
The third guy says, "I'm a R.U.B., you know... 
Rich, Urban, Biker." 
They turn to the woman and ask her, "What are you?" 
She replies: "I'm a WIFE, you know.... 
Wash, Iron, F***, Etc." 
A second gal answers their question before they even ask it: 
"BITCH "So, just exactly what is a BITCH??????????" They ask in unison. 
* B- BABE 
* I- IN 
* T- TOTAL 
* C- CONTROL of 
* H- HERSELF 
> 
So ladies, next time somebody calls you "Bitch"...SMILE......and say Thank 
You!!!!!!!! 
MAKE A WOMAN HAPPY! 
PASS THIS ONE ON TO AS MANY WOMEN AS YOU KNOW!

Hey Y'all,

Less then 2 weekes before I'm back in Paradise (Texas, not Hawaii),  lookin
forward to seein all ya that I can.  Here's a little note to spread the
holiday cheer.



Subject:  Johnny Christmas Letter

Dear Santa,
You must be surprised I am writing you today, the 26th of
December. Well I would very much like to clear up certain things that have
occurred since the beginning of the month! While filled with illusions, I
wrote you a letter.  I asked for a bicycle, an electric train set, a pair of
roller blades, and a football uniform.  I destroyed my brain studying the
whole year!  Not only was I
first in my class, but I had the best grades in the whole school. I'm not
going to lie to you Santa; there was no one in the entire neighborhood that
behaved better than me. With my parents, my brothers, friends and my
neighbors, I would go on errands and even help the elderly across the
street.  There was virtually nothing I wouldn't do for humanity! WHAT BALLS
YOU HAVE LEAVING ME A FUCKING YO-YO, A STUPID ASS WHISTLE,AND A PAIR OF
SOCKS!!!What the FUCK were you THINKING, YOU FAT SON OF A BITCH!?!?!That
you've taken me for a SUCKER THE WHOLE FUCKING YEAR, to come out with some
SHIT LIKE THIS under the damn tree.  AS IF YOU HADN'T FUCKED ME ENOUGH,YOU
GAVE THAT LITTLE SHITHEAD ACROSS THE STREET SO MANY FUCKING TOYS, HECAN'T
EVEN WALK INTO HIS DAMN HOUSE! Please don't let me see you trying to fit
your BIG ASS DOWN MY CHIMNEY NEXT YEAR! I'LL FUCK YOU UP! I'll throw rocks
at those STUPID ASS REINDEERS OF YOURS, AND SCARE THEM THE FUCK AWAY, SO
YOU'LL HAVE TO WALK YOUR BIG FAT ASS EVERYWHERE, JUST LIKE I HAVE TO DO
SINCE YOU DIDN'T GIVE ME THAT FUCKING BIKE, YOU PUNK BITCH. You know what
Santa, FUCK YOU!!  Next year you'll find out HOW BAD I CAN REALLY FUCKING
BE...YOU'VE BEEN STEPPING ON THIS MOTHERFUCKER FAR TOO LONG!
SO WATCH YOUR BACK NEXT YEAR, YOU FAT BITCH!

Sincerely,
Johnny

No bets for the LSU game, but I feel that LSU should give the Vols. a run
for their money.

Texas finally wised up and gave Major the start...Mack must need to win this

Oh well, have fun at work.  I have to go back to sleep.

Never mind.  So anyway, I am totally worked right now.  I went to the
Blazer game with my friend Kate and we ended up going out afterward.  i
ended up staying out until 2am and I had to be in to work at 5:30.  So
basically my day is totally sucking.  How are you doing?

It's a bitch to be gone from the family for that long but it very busy so it
goes fast for me.  We had our fourth (and probably last) kid on May 13th.
Her name is Chloe Elizabeth.  She is perfect.  My two year old (Kate) was
very surprised when we brought her home.  Carson said he wanted a brother
and Kelly wants to hold her all the time.  You can check some pictures out

So what the hell is Kims problem.  You have been telling her for months that 
you were going to move out.  What a bitch.  Regarding the Nicole thing it 
really isn't that big of a deal anyway.  When I am down there we go out but 
it's not like we are together or anything.  I wouldn't let them hassle me 
affect whether I would date her or not but sometimes I just get a little sick 
of hearing about it all the time.  Nicole is awesome and I like dating her 
while I am down there.  It is just a wierd situation.   About the moving to 
LA thing it really is a job issue at this point.  It will be hard to find a 
job as good as the one that I currently have and that is going to be the real 
issue.

Hey beotch,

The ski thing is on.  We are going to Lake Tahoe.  Arriving on Wed,
March 14th and leaving Sunday March 18th.  The closest airport is in Reno,
but some of the people are flying into Sacremento cuz it is cheaper.  We
have a house rented out and it sleeps 12.  I think it is going to be all
women with at the most 4 guys including you and me.  The women are mostly
single, wealthy, and looking for a noncommital, spring break type
relationship.  I think Nancy and I will be renting a car to drive to this
place from the airport.  Let me know if you want to hitch a ride with us.

 MESSAGE OF THE DAY:

 Too often, we lose sight of life's simple pleasures.
 Remember, when someone annoys you it takes 42 muscles in your face to frown
BUT, it only takes 4 muscles to extend your arm and bitch-slap the

I don't know if you are speaking to me or not but what happened...You
missed a good one!

I went to my game at 10pm and got back to Tania's about 12:15 and started
to light it up with shooters.

We stayed up until 6am.  At about 4am one of Tania's grumpy lesbian
neighbors barged into her living room and told us that she hadn't been able
to sleep for the last 4 hours.  Needless to say Tania was not impressed as
the lesbian bitch could have just called.

Anyway I am going to get a coffee soon, don't know if you are interested.

I had to respond.  

Speaking of bitch....all of the Cornhusker fans are bitching about Stoops 
not  taking the head coach position at the Cleveland Browns or any other job 
that will get him out of their backyard.  By the way, Stoops just started 
working on his book "OU's 7th Football National Championship"; Chapter 3, Who

I see that we are scheduled to have lunch today.   I may have to postpone 
again, I'll let you know later this morning.  I am out all weekend and we 
have to have the final comments on the Analyst Presentation in by sunday 
night so I may be working over lunch.  Actually, I think we are in pretty 
good shape so I will probably be doing lunch but just don't be too mad if I 
have to cancel.

PS  Your brother told me he went to 3 bowl games (when I found out that two 
of them were the galleryfurniture.com bowl and that one in Shreveport (I 
can't remember the name of it)) I realized he is a very, very sick college 
football fan.

Fellas, I'm pretty much having the most difficult week of work I've ever
had, so I propose that we drink heavily Friday night . . . I think this is
a wise choice to ensure that our livers don't go into shock due to a lack
of alcohol in our system . . .

RE: Demand Ken Lay Donate Proceeds from Enron Stock Sales

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million (you greedy son of a bitch), many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings. Besides, your ass is going to jail anyway and you can't spend it there.

Sincerely,

Mark Germann

Ken,

I'm back.  Sorry for the delay.  It's been crazy here and I'm very backed up 
on emails especially the fun ones like this.

My brief moment in print (very brief) certainly hasn't gone to my head 
especially as an Enron  "B" teamer.  In response to your worker bee comment, 
I can certainly say "buzz" but not someone who can sell that many shares of 
stock!  You are the king.

Your last email was good and I'm not sure I can respond adequately but at 
least I didn't get help!

You win......but you still owe me lunch.

Mike

Speaking of bitch....all of the Cornhusker fans are bitching about Stoops

working on his book "OU's 7th Football National Championship"; Chapter 3, Who

I see that we are scheduled to have lunch today.   I may have to postpone 
again, I'll let you know later this morning.  I am out all weekend and we 
have to have the final comments on the Analyst Presentation in by sunday 
night so I may be working over lunch.  Actually, I think we are in pretty 
good shape so I will probably be doing lunch but just don't be too mad if I 
have to cancel.

Ken

PS  Your brother told me he went to 3 bowl games (when I found out that two 
of them were the galleryfurniture.com bowl and that one in Shreveport (I 
can't remember the name of it)) I realized he is a very, very sick college 
football fan.

my god, she's like that nagging cough in november that you just can't seem
to shake! know we must be sensitive for obvious reasons, but haven't played
all our cards-yet, je pense.  i think it's best you mention the fact that
she may want to ASK me if she can come.....tell her that you, katy AND kelly
have done so already, and bethlehem is FULL rt now.  no room in the inn.
which means, seriously, she may need to research alternative places to stay.
  really don't want to be a bitch, but honestly, it's my vacation too, and
as i said- love hosting, but not when it becomes uncomfortable.  will be
glad to treat her like a princess if she can come another time and give me a
heads-up.  i'm really sorry, but honest to god, things are getting out of
hand.  may also want to mention the weekend plans to go to the eagles
concert, which will be an all day affair (told all the gang to come at noon
and we'd drink margs and go to the pub all day before the concert)- i know
if you don't get tickets, you'll be ok, but lis can't go to the BATHROOM
alone....aughhhhh!  ok- off to dinner.  just saw the mandolin movie.  bad
news bears.  not on my recommendation list.  chat later-

No, I don't have that CD.  Can I crank it up so loud in my house, and piss 
off the neighbors?  I was out til about 11:30 last night.  (another two shift 
evening).  I'm pretty close  to the point where I can't drink after 10 ish on 
a school night.  Then, my neighbors house alarm went off for over 1/2 hour at 
2:30.  Of course i called the police.  So i didn't wag my butt out of bed til 
7:30.  
So first party may be feb 24.  any thoughts?
I'd forward an email that has gone around a few times about your dad's girly 
friend, only then letting her know she's invited.  maybe tell her the wrong 
time.

When are you off to san fran?  I have a wallet i'm trying to have made out 
there at some stuffy, but cool store off union square.

how are you?  do you have the Dido CD?  if not, I am going to get it for

to get the Blackberry, which is the new awesome one, but of course it doesn't 
work on the Enron system.  
my dad just called and yelled at me again that he wants his bitch invited to 
my sister's shower.  he swore that she would not go, so the whole thing is so 
stupid.  I am out of invites.  can I send her an email about it?  this is the 
last thing that I have time to worry about.  

what is going on with you?  I am sure that you have another crazy day.  write 
back when you can!

Lt. Bieraugel,

I doubt you are able to receive email at this time, but just in case you
are...............wanted to let you know that you are making the news!  Just
read an article in the USA Today online that lists your ship as one in the
Arabian Sea that has launched Tomahawks.  So I'm bragging about you to everyone
in my office....."My buddy Paul, as Chief Weapon Officer, is lobbing missiles at
the Taliban, he's pushing the button himself!"  I know you guys are well-trained
and just doing your job, but your college buddies are proud of you and the
entire country is behind you (90% approve the actions in a poll!).

So God bless and Godspeed, you get back safely to those four kids of yours!

Take care bud,
Ern

Ernie and Gerald, well dudes, we're doing just what we said we were not
going to do.  Fall out of touch again.  Here is the latest.  I am out on my
ship for six months now.  We left June 4th and we get back in November.
It's a bitch to be gone from the family for that long but it very busy so it
goes fast for me.  We had our fourth (and probably last) kid on May 13th.
Her name is Chloe Elizabeth.  She is perfect.  My two year old (Kate) was
very surprised when we brought her home.  Carson said he wanted a brother
and Kelly wants to hold her all the time.  You can check some pictures out
at www.geocities.com/pbieraugel.  Take it easy you guys and stay in touch.
Paul.

Jai,
I haven't written you a long e-mail ina while, so I thought it was about
time - just for old times sake!
I guess there is also something I wanted to say...so here goes.
When we first started e-mailing and hanging out,  you were alot of fun
(well, you still are),  and I thought it was the beginning of a friendship.
Then after a short time,  I realized that there was more.  I just went with
it and went with what I thought felt right.  Recently,  for me at least,
everyone seems have involved themselves in a simple situation ,  making
everything more complicated and confusing (I guess this is my payback for
being such a big mouth/ gossiper about everyone else).

Now,  everything just seems weird.
 What happened to that "waitress/ customer" bond we once had???....(I
thought I would throw that last part in here to lighten the mood of this
e-mail).

Everything just happened so quickly,  that looking back it's hard to believe
that all this happened in a month.  I guess why I'm writing you this is to
let you know that I think your an amazing person,  and someone that I
consider a friend.  At the same time,  this friendship is not anything that
I'm going to force.

I'm not expecting a response from this e-mail and I'm not asking for
anything.  I just wanted to let you know where I was coming from.  What
better way to do it then over e-mail - afterall,  isn't that how this all
started?

Emily

read an article in the USA Today online that lists your ship as one in the
Arabian Sea that has launched Tomahawks.  So I'm bragging about you to everyone

the Taliban, he's pushing the button himself!"  I know you guys are well-trained
and just doing your job, but your college buddies are proud of you and the
entire country is behind you (90% approve the actions in a poll!).

So God bless and Godspeed, you get back safely to those four kids of yours!

Take care bud,

Ernie and Gerald, well dudes, we're doing just what we said we were not
going to do.  Fall out of touch again.  Here is the latest.  I am out on my
ship for six months now.  We left June 4th and we get back in November.
It's a bitch to be gone from the family for that long but it very busy so it
goes fast for me.  We had our fourth (and probably last) kid on May 13th.
Her name is Chloe Elizabeth.  She is perfect.  My two year old (Kate) was
very surprised when we brought her home.  Carson said he wanted a brother
and Kelly wants to hold her all the time.  You can check some pictures out

Ken,

You might point out to McConnell that there is a strong correlation between
OU's football success and the price of a barrel of oil.  Talk about the best
team money can buy!

Also, if Mike has any friends coming from the East Coast to visit him in
Oklahoma tell him to send them these directions:

1)  Head West until you smell sh_t--you have made it to Texas,

2)  Head North until you step in it--you are now in Oklahoma!

OK.  But at least we have upside.   The ability to count past 7 exceeds the
limit  of most OU students, alums, football players and coaches thereby
either
capping the number of national championships you can talk about at 7.
Alternatively, OU would have to increase academic standards to enable them
to
count beyond the 7 national championships.  Unfortunately, we already know
that
actually winning a national championship with athletes possesing an IQ above
plant life only occurs at Nebraska, so you are in a horrible Catch 22.  (I'm
sorry, for OU grads like yourself a you wouldn't understand the term "Catch
22".
Just take it from me,  you can't  win).

Oh.... you may note that I have decided to involve the big guns in this

Ken,

I had to respond.

Speaking of bitch....all of the Cornhusker fans are bitching about Stoops
not
taking the head coach position at the Cleveland Browns or any other job that
will get him out of their backyard.  By the way, Stoops just started working
on
his book "OU's 7th Football National Championship"; Chapter 3, Who are the

Actually, I believe that may be correct.  I verified it in the new book by
Tom
Osborn,  How OU dominated my coaching career - my only losing record in
Coaching.  It was a best seller.

I see that we are scheduled to have lunch today.   I may have to postpone
again,
I'll let you know later this morning.  I am out all weekend and we have to
have
the final comments on the Analyst Presentation in by sunday night so I may
be
working over lunch.  Actually, I think we are in pretty good shape so I will
probably be doing lunch but just don't be too mad if I have to cancel.

Ken

PS  Your brother told me he went to 3 bowl games (when I found out that two
of
them were the galleryfurniture.com bowl and that one in Shreveport (I can't
remember the name of it)) I realized he is a very, very sick college
football
fan.

Lenny! jumping in the conversation without missing a beat....good to have
you with us. Nice comedy....but the only fat, bald 30 year old is the
Dogger. (just kidding dog, you's not fat....you's just fluffy). Don is
bald, but not fat. Roby is balding, but just a little "stocky". Clint has a
belly, but is not balding. Other than that, we are all pretty normal
(please use that term loosely).

Your parents would love to have us at their crib. Dog could rummage through
all of your belongings, eat all of your parents' food, and wake them up at
the ass crack of dawn with scrambled eggs and jumby. Roby could show your
mom "a good time". Porteous, Clay, and Myers could talk to your dad about
his company's legal shortcomings. Bernie could sell you all some much
needed life insurance. Clint could smoke, and Dehart could clear his lungs
so that he could ski without falling dead on the slopes. Gooch could lend
Don the money to build an addition to your maw's bathroom (so that Dog and
Roby could smell it up). And Naquin could try to get with your sister, take
notes of the whole weekend's proceedings, and make copies for all of us to
remember them by.

Porthole....see if Timmy, Tricia, Mike Thomas, etc. would be interested in
going on the trip...Lenny....see about all of your Houston Fiji buddies
(house bitch, Tim, Val, etc.). Tell Tim we'll let him bring his new wife
with him, too, although that might mean that there could be up to 3 Phi
Mu's on the trip....quorum could be met, and "the Phi Mu Crew" might be in
full effect; God help us.

Clint, what about Freret and Dawn (that might make 4 Mu's)?

Anyone else we can think of who might be interested in this trip (Jan 10 -
14th)?

  Some cute bumper stickers!

  Some people are only alive because
  it is illegal to shoot them

  I used to have a handle on life, but it broke.

  WANTED: Meaningful overnight relationship.

  You're just jealous because the voices
  only talk to ME.

  BEER: It's not just for breakfast anymore.

  So you're a feminist...Isn't that cute.

  I need someone real bad...
  Are you real bad?

  BEAUTY is in the eye of the beer holder.

  All men are idiots...
  and I married their king.

  The more you complain,
  the longer God makes you live.

  I(nternal) R(evenue) S(ervice):
  We've got what it takes
  to take what you've got.

  Hard work has a future payoff.
  Laziness pays off now.

  Reality is a crutch for people
  who can't handle drugs.

  Out of my mind...Back in five minutes.

  As long as there are tests,
  there will be prayer in public schools.

  Hang up and drive.

  I said "NO" to drugs,
  but they didn't listen.

  Your kid may be an Honor Student,
  but YOU'RE still an idiot.

  Smile, it's the second best thing you can do with your lips.

  I took an IQ test and the results were negative.

  Where there's a will...I want to be in it.

  It's lonely at the top, but you eat better.

  Don't drink and drive...
  You might hit a bump and spill your drink.

  Consciousness: That annoying time between naps.

  Ever stop to think, and forget to start again?

  Always remember you're unique...
  Just like everyone else.

  HONK
  If You Want To See My Finger

  Who lit the fuse on your tampon?

  I don't have a license to kill.
  I have a learner's permit.

  I wasn't born a bitch.
  Men like you made me this way.

  Keep honking while I reload.

  Taxation WITH representation isn't so hot, either!

  Who were the testers for
  Preparations A through G?

  Madness takes its toll.
  Please have exact change.

  5 days a week my body is a temple.
    The other two, it's an amusement park.

  EARTH FIRST!
  We'll stripmine the other planets later.

  If you drink, don't park.
  Accidents cause people.

  If you can read this
  I can hit my brakes and sue you.

  Save the whales!
  Trade them for valuable prizes.

  Whitewater is over
  when the First Lady sings.

  Jack Kevorkian for White House physician.

  My wife keeps complaining I never listen to her
  ...or something like that.

  Sure you can trust the government!
  Just ask an Indian!

  Alcohol and calculus don't mix.
  Never drink and derive.

  If we are what we eat,
  I'm cheap, fast, and easy.

  Stop repeat offenders.
  Don't re-elect them!

Hey Steph!

I just got back from Italy!  Got a last minute assignment on the 7th to
travel on the 10th and just returned on the 16th.  It was cool b/c it was
Italy but a longer and less busy trip would have been better!

How long are Nancy & Michael in town?  I'd love to meet up with yall.

I've got to tell you that I've got this person who is visiting me this
weekend (actually Thurs-sun).  He's been a good friend for a long time and I
like him a lot. If I meet up with you guys, I may bring him along if that's
alright.

I'm going to my grandparents house for Thanksgiving.  Going to be strange
b/c Todd's not there and it's going to be the thing that everyone's thinking
but now saying - you know what I mean?

My phone #s are 281-483-2241 work and 713-533-9785 home and I can't recall
my cell right now.

We need to do dinner or pre-dinner drinks (or just skip dinner) and bitch
about the idiots we both work with!!!

Let me know what's up!

Jenn

Hey, Jen,
What's been going on?  What are you doing for Thanksgiving?  I seem to
have missplaced your phone numbers (I'm sure if I dug through my pile of
junk at home I would find them!).  Give me a call.  Nancey & Michael are
going to be in town for Turkey Day.  Lots of fun going on at my office
these days.

I would have responded sooner, but I was on the 9:30 EWS conference call.  

I am planning to go.  I'm pretty sure Jane Tholt, who trades El Paso on the West gas desk, will go.  Suzanne Calcagno has also indicated an interest so she may go as well.

Jane's major concern at this time is that El Paso doesn't mess with the pooling procedures.  Their proposal calls for increasing the number of pools on the system from the current six to twenty, which the Desk feels would impair liquidity.  

I wouldn't look for a lot of progress at this conference.  The EOC full-requirements customers are going to be howling about having their flexibility restricted in any way, and the other firm customers who have CD limits are going to howl about the full requirements customers having a secondary priority superior to theirs.  This same proposal was on the table and they couldn't reach a compromise in six months of settlement conferences working with the chief FERC ADR person on the Amoco/Burlington complaint case.  Our preference is with the CD customers' position, but if the full requirements customers don't get some kind of accommodation, they will never settle.  Then if FERC rules against them, they will take it to the appeals court and maybe further.  This is a BIG issue for them.

No, I can't say that Argentine beef is better than American, but it IS
better than German (they just can't grow OR cut a cow right over here)!

Yeah, I used ChemLawn on my house in Copperfield, and they said once it's
dry it's fine for the dogs, and I did have a really nice yard...but I think
that was after I stopped them and started using Rob Townsend...anyway my
garten now SUCKS!  It'S FULL  OF CRAPP, lumber, building stuff and a huge
crane that just won't go away!!!

You really would like the movie we saw, maybe it will come there with
untertitel in English, but you would understand it in Deutsch...it's about
an Experiment that was done, I think at the Univ of Cal.  They took 20
people, made 10 prisoners and 10 their guards..in reality they had to stop
the experiment after 7 days because things were getting out of control...in
the movie they carried it on further..it was great!  Very intense, very
blooooody in the end!

I can't BELIEVE that you stayed home for St Patty's!  I watched a
documentary on Ireland and St Patty's and now I understand why it's a bigger
celebration outside of Ireland than in Ireland.  I have a great new channel
on my satellite, the English Travel channel...IT'S GREAT!  They have all
kinds of shows on countries all over the world, AND IT'S IN ENGLISH!!!

That's terrible that someone tried to pull up your plant, do you remember
that they stole a clay pot of dirt from me over there, incredible!  No, here
we don't have that trouble...YET!  Maybe in 15 - 20 years it will come.  I
hope not.  I have such nice plants in pots outside the office and really
pretty garten art in it, it would be gone in a second in Montrose!

So what#S Happenning in NEw York for you and Julie???

I still haven't been able to do my taxes because of WELLSFARGO!!! They have
my mortgage now and I CANNOT get my 1098 from them, I have written them,
faxed them, emailed them and finally today telephoned them...I WAS ON HOLD
FOR A REP FOR OVER 15 MINUTES!!! I chewed her ass out when she finally got
on the phone and the bitch said she wasn't allowed to FAX IT TO ME!  I told
her she would not only fax me my interest for 2000 BUT ALSO THE PAYOFF,
because I would not have a mortgage at such a piece of ")o($/ company as
theirs....I did'nt mention that I had sold the house.

Everything is on track for the sale, we close on May 4th and I GET MY
MONEY...HONEY!!!!

Well it's late and I want to go home...take care..connie

is bitching what you do or what you are?  it's probably the latter
because you always have and always will be my little bitch.
ernie, got a ps2 baby!!!! working on that god damned madden 2002,
still trying to win 2 games in a row.  look forward to kicking
your ass soon (in golf and madden '02).  kevin make sure you bring
your knee pads on sunday.  quigley, bring extra clubs in case you
break some more.  mark leave all the clubs at home and just bring
that 9 wood you hit off the tee, your norwegian chipper and your
putter. joe just try and hit the damn ball.  richard, i can't talk
trash 'cause your daughter is so damn cute (love the picture you
sent); oh wait yes i can: i guess she got your wifes looks!
jerry:  where art thou????? as for myself i will soon be buying
stock in some sort of golf ball manufacturing company seeing as i
am putting so much money into those companies with my "golf" game.
kingwood, brock, it's all the same..golf with friends.  quit your
bitching, wake up a little earlier, and play with your friends.
kevin, you're still a whore.

Hey Bro,

Yeah, I got the email from a couple of sources.  Good looking kid.  Yes, we
are getting old but I still like to get drunk and act like an idiot.  I
guess we will never grow out of that.  Last week was bitch but I think it
put everybody back into reality.  I think there will be some good out of
this.  Even though the economy will go into recession, people aren't caring
about money some much anymore.  The recession won't bring people down as
they realize their own mortality.  The recession will end quickly as soon
as Americans can get a sense of security again.  I am just going to sit
tight on my loser stocks.  There will be a huge rally in about a year.
This is going to instill a greater feeling of freedom and capitalism in the
young generation (God I am old for saying that) that we don't have.

Weird things are happenning in DC.   They must have credible evidence of
another possible attack this Saturday.  A battallion of US Army troops are
on there way up to DC from Ft. Bragg, NC.  They are only saying it is for
"added security".  I plan on staying home Saturday and working on my house.
Keep an eye out for your self Saturday.

Hey Steph!

I just got back from Italy!  Got a last minute assignment on the 7th to
travel on the 10th and just returned on the 16th.  It was cool b/c it was
Italy but a longer and less busy trip would have been better!

How long are Nancy & Michael in town?  I'd love to meet up with yall.

I've got to tell you that I've got this person who is visiting me this
weekend (actually Thurs-sun).  He's been a good friend for a long time and I
like him a lot. If I meet up with you guys, I may bring him along if that's
alright.

I'm going to my grandparents house for Thanksgiving.  Going to be strange
b/c Todd's not there and it's going to be the thing that everyone's thinking
but now saying - you know what I mean?

My phone #s are 281-483-2241 work and 713-533-9785 home and I can't recall
my cell right now.

We need to do dinner or pre-dinner drinks (or just skip dinner) and bitch
about the idiots we both work with!!!

Let me know what's up!

Joaner Boner -
Well, in my usual slacker fashion, I haven't bought my plane ticket yet - so 
I totally think you should go to Sunriver. I might come visit you there if 
there's room. But an S.F. visit is imminent, I swear. I'll call you soon to 
discuss the alcoholism of your co-worker/boyfriend, as well as the techniques 
for acquiring this sexy body for the new year. Work is consuming my life and 
eating me whole - very chaotic what with hiding all the power from you guys 
and whatnot. Imagine the pressure. Another reason it might not be the best 
time for me to come is that I'm moving on Friday. Amber and Molly and I found 
a big, beautiful house in NE, near Grant High - it's kickass. But it's sucked 
away all of my money and will probably take over every free moment for the 
next month just to get it set up. If you want, you should stop by for a sleep 
over on your way to Bend. We'll throw a party. And what's up with the wrist 
disease? Are you not taking your calcium or something? I'm convinced that 
these wacky desk jobs are aging us youthful beauties prematurely. At least 
that's the excuse I like to give when I come in to work looking like I just 
bathed in a life-sized ashtray. Call me soon - I'm really curious to find out 
why Brooks is doing the chicken dance EVER let alone in your room in the 
middle of the night. Wheeew!

Happy Sexy Body New Year,

Subject: Sexy Body for the New Year!!!


Hey Kate -
My subject line is a duplicate of an email I received this morning from some
beauty .com site.  Steve Cross puts me on all of these stupid mailing lists,
so I thought I'd be retarded and put that in my subject line because it's a
stupid subject!

Anyway, how are you doing these days?  I wanted to write and see if you
really got your ticket to come visit over President's Day weekend!  I
totally want you to come down!!!  I'd be so excited.  If you don't, though,
I think I'm going to look into going up to Bend for the weekend to chill in
SunRiver and snowboard a little!  Maybe you could meet me there and stay w/
me at my parents house?  Ash is going up for sure.  If you're coming down
here, that's GREAT!  I'd be SOOO excited.

I'm on complete crack today, if you can't tell.  I have carpal tunnell, too.
Last night I woke up at 2am to Brooks coming home from a drunken night out
and he started doing the chicken dance in my room and almost knocked over my
entire shelf, tv, etc.  Then he started babbling about nothing, passed
straight out and started totally snoring.  So I didn't get back to sleep
until like 4:30 and had to wake up at 6.  I was livid this morning.  I'm
such a bitch, but I need my sleep!  Dammit.

Anyway, write soon!   I miss you!

thanks for including me.  i don't think i will be able to make a ski trip durning that period.  i have to go to miami and party on south beach.  sorry.  maybe if something was scheduled around spring skiing (feb-mar)  i could definately go.  robicheaux is bald?  i remember that bastard was so hairy when i was living with him.  i used to have to shave the soap in the shower after he used it.  i know some of the houston guys would like to go skiing so keep us informed.

Lenny! jumping in the conversation without missing a beat....good to have
you with us. Nice comedy....but the only fat, bald 30 year old is the
Dogger. (just kidding dog, you's not fat....you's just fluffy). Don is
bald, but not fat. Roby is balding, but just a little "stocky". Clint has a
belly, but is not balding. Other than that, we are all pretty normal
(please use that term loosely).

Your parents would love to have us at their crib. Dog could rummage through
all of your belongings, eat all of your parents' food, and wake them up at
the ass crack of dawn with scrambled eggs and jumby. Roby could show your
mom "a good time". Porteous, Clay, and Myers could talk to your dad about
his company's legal shortcomings. Bernie could sell you all some much
needed life insurance. Clint could smoke, and Dehart could clear his lungs
so that he could ski without falling dead on the slopes. Gooch could lend
Don the money to build an addition to your maw's bathroom (so that Dog and
Roby could smell it up). And Naquin could try to get with your sister, take
notes of the whole weekend's proceedings, and make copies for all of us to
remember them by.

Porthole....see if Timmy, Tricia, Mike Thomas, etc. would be interested in
going on the trip...Lenny....see about all of your Houston Fiji buddies
(house bitch, Tim, Val, etc.). Tell Tim we'll let him bring his new wife
with him, too, although that might mean that there could be up to 3 Phi
Mu's on the trip....quorum could be met, and "the Phi Mu Crew" might be in
full effect; God help us.

Clint, what about Freret and Dawn (that might make 4 Mu's)?

Anyone else we can think of who might be interested in this trip (Jan 10 -
14th)?

brenda was a test.  stratego failed.  this email is yet more evidence.  

the fact that stratego was not aggressively machinating does not impress me in the least.  

the fact that you are still representing makes me sad.  

asking for props?  please, dude, the depths of your selfishness have yet to be established.  

don't treat me like a fool or one of your bitches.  take a moment and peer inside - that tinge of guilt?  that's what i'm talking about.

Hey Steph!

I just got back from Italy!  Got a last minute assignment on the 7th to
travel on the 10th and just returned on the 16th.  It was cool b/c it was
Italy but a longer and less busy trip would have been better!

How long are Nancy & Michael in town?  I'd love to meet up with yall.

I've got to tell you that I've got this person who is visiting me this
weekend (actually Thurs-sun).  He's been a good friend for a long time and I
like him a lot. If I meet up with you guys, I may bring him along if that's
alright.

I'm going to my grandparents house for Thanksgiving.  Going to be strange
b/c Todd's not there and it's going to be the thing that everyone's thinking
but now saying - you know what I mean?

My phone #s are 281-483-2241 work and 713-533-9785 home and I can't recall
my cell right now.

We need to do dinner or pre-dinner drinks (or just skip dinner) and bitch
about the idiots we both work with!!!

Let me know what's up!

Yo Smokey- wait no, let me correct, Smoke-free:

Count me in on that bro.  I'll be there with bells on.  I want to reserve my
spot in the "Married Dorm" with hopes of getting cool make out with Tanya
and maybe engage in some naughty conversation (one word or two) with Shawna.
(Sorry Myers, she is tired of hearing that Mike Foster and Cleo Fields are
in your study group)

Don't bother in booking me a flight, I'll just ride my motorbike straight to
the slope.  I hear the ride to BR is a bitch but clears up shortly after.  I
would ask the lovely Gooch to accompany me on the glorious journey but don't
currenly have a side car for my nut-rocket.  Don, if work is a little slow,
maybe you can work me up a bid on a matching yellow/black side car. Or,
perhaps Ross can calculate the cost of renting a Harley to Colorado (the one
with the side car, please)

Anyways, hope this trip materializes. Sounds like a kick ass time.

Hey Em,

Well it's 8:30 Friday night and surprise I'm still at the office.  I love 
this place!!!  To answer your question, yes I am definitely suffering 
withdrawal.  I will be working very hard over the next few months to cure 
that though.  Nothing really exciting to report here except A) Nick called me 
my first day back in the office to make sure I arrived home safely ( I really 
don't know what to do about all of that)  B) Ben keeps calling me to see if I 
want to go out - 2 nights in a row in addition to our Steak Night beer (I 
haven't gone either night).  How ironic is all of this?  I've got one guy 
worrying and thinking of me that I care nothing for...I've got another guy 
who I at one time cared for but no longer do trying to take advantage of my 
vulnerable state (which in truth isn't really vulnerable at all) and another 
guy, who I until fairly recently cared for, who I think could go the rest of 
his life without ever seeing/speaking to me again (Or course I guess the 
reverse of that is true as well).

Talk to you soon,
Susan

Positive notes:  I think Ted is getting greying and losing hair with the 
added stress of corn trading.  He looks old and pitiful.

Subject: bonjour mes amis


oh, the wonders of technology.  here i am, 1000's of kilometers away,
communicating via email with you fabulous folks.  have just stumbled in from
a pub featuring an irish 'jig' band- i picked up the rhythem instantly, i
must admit.....and after only 12 pints!  needless to say, it was a brilliant
cultural experience, and the only thing that would've been better would've
been if all of you could have been there to a., mock and harass me, and b.,
make yourselves as hated as this american made herself....why is that cider
makes you want to sing show tunes and bitch about shitty english  washing
machines....?  anyways- just wanted you to know i was thinking of you- even
if it WAS  after i thought for 15 minutes where the closest burger king was
( *jen- this is as close as you're going to get to those ridiculous
miniature books w/ PMS quotes you're so fond of......how id boulder by the
way...?)  sue- glad you got home okay- going thru withdrawl yet?  matt- got
your emails- twice.  double thanks.  hope my biting response hasn't sent you
into therapy- yet.  kk, llkj,etc- hope all is well in lala land- just fyi- i
think red bull is cheaper here- imagine the possibilities!  and for the reat
of the gang- enjoy yourselves at the infamous cougar 5 yr- i will- OF
COURSE- be there in spirit.....and i'm not being cynical, really......
call/write soon, s'il vous plait......

brenda was a test.  stratego failed.  this email is yet more evidence.

the fact that stratego was not aggressively machinating does not impress me

the fact that you are still representing makes me sad.

don't treat me like a fool or one of your bitches.  take a moment and peer

Lenny! jumping in the conversation without missing a beat....good to have
you with us. Nice comedy....but the only fat, bald 30 year old is the
Dogger. (just kidding dog, you's not fat....you's just fluffy). Don is
bald, but not fat. Roby is balding, but just a little "stocky". Clint has a
belly, but is not balding. Other than that, we are all pretty normal
(please use that term loosely).

Your parents would love to have us at their crib. Dog could rummage through
all of your belongings, eat all of your parents' food, and wake them up at
the ass crack of dawn with scrambled eggs and jumby. Roby could show your
mom "a good time". Porteous, Clay, and Myers could talk to your dad about
his company's legal shortcomings. Bernie could sell you all some much
needed life insurance. Clint could smoke, and Dehart could clear his lungs
so that he could ski without falling dead on the slopes. Gooch could lend
Don the money to build an addition to your maw's bathroom (so that Dog and
Roby could smell it up). And Naquin could try to get with your sister, take
notes of the whole weekend's proceedings, and make copies for all of us to
remember them by.

Porthole....see if Timmy, Tricia, Mike Thomas, etc. would be interested in
going on the trip...Lenny....see about all of your Houston Fiji buddies
(house bitch, Tim, Val, etc.). Tell Tim we'll let him bring his new wife
with him, too, although that might mean that there could be up to 3 Phi
Mu's on the trip....quorum could be met, and "the Phi Mu Crew" might be in
full effect; God help us.

Clint, what about Freret and Dawn (that might make 4 Mu's)?

Anyone else we can think of who might be interested in this trip (Jan 10 -
14th)?

Some of our fresh arrivals include Amores  Perros  (that's Love's a Bitch for all those who no habla  espanol), an Academy Award
 Nominee for Best Foreign  Language Film (it lost to that pesky Crouching Tiger)  that many considered one of the best films of last year.  Continuing on the Oscar-tip, we also have Academy Award
  Nominee Juliette Binoche in The  Widow of St. Pierre  and Songcatcher ,  a folksy romance (think O Brother Where Art Thou?,  but good) starring Aidan Quinn and Tumbleweeds' Janet  Mcteer.   And  this is just the beginning of some of the great films that  will be appearing on CinemaNow   in the coming months. February promises to be our biggest  month ever (okay, it's the shortest month, but it will seem  huge). Lots of new films, special promotions, contests,  added downloads and more. I'm giddy just thinking about  it.  Enjoy  the films!    CinemaNow Watch Movies Here!     [IMAGE] ?  Copyright 2001 CinemaNow. All rights reserved. Privacy  Policy .

I think there is a happy medium between our feelings for Emily.  Speaking as
a realist, I don't think she's as cool as you think she is.  She does some
stuff that seems selfish and calculating, which is totally different than
the person she "publicly" portrays.  That makes me suspicious.  Also keep in
mind that she treats me differently than she treats you.  I liked her a lot
better when she treated me like a friend.

Regardless, your advice seems sound.  AND, we will get another chance to
stare at Sandy's body.

   Jai,
   I haven't written you a long e-mail ina while, so I thought it was about
   time - just for old times sake!
   I guess there is also something I wanted to say...so here goes.
   When we first started e-mailing and hanging out,  you were alot of fun
   (well, you still are),  and I thought it was the beginning of a
   friendship.
   Then after a short time,  I realized that there was more.  I just went
   with
   it and went with what I thought felt right.  Recently,  for me at least,
   everyone seems have involved themselves in a simple situation ,  making
   everything more complicated and confusing (I guess this is my payback
   for
   being such a big mouth/ gossiper about everyone else).

   Now,  everything just seems weird.
    What happened to that "waitress/ customer" bond we once had???....(I
   thought I would throw that last part in here to lighten the mood of this
   e-mail).

   Everything just happened so quickly,  that looking back it's hard to
   believe
   that all this happened in a month.  I guess why I'm writing you this is
   to
   let you know that I think your an amazing person,  and someone that I
   consider a friend.  At the same time,  this friendship is not anything
   that
   I'm going to force.

   I'm not expecting a response from this e-mail and I'm not asking for
   anything.  I just wanted to let you know where I was coming from.  What
   better way to do it then over e-mail - afterall,  isn't that how this
   all
   started?

   Emily

	That could only come from an American. In this time of war as a Brit I can only turn to Churchill.

	"We shall not flag or fail. We shall go on to the end to find some cash. We shall fight Electricite de France, we shall fight the Level Seas, Transoceans ,and Global Coals we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength aginast the monopoly producers, we shall defend our bonuses, whatever the cost may be. We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight at the loading ports, we shall fight in the power stations and in the mines, we shall fight in the sampling laboratories, we shall never surrender any cash."

	have a great thanksgiving. good bless America.

	Subject:	Thanksgiving



	Today is Thanksgiving.  A uniquely American holiday, it is one that I personally value the most.  It has no religious significance, and is not tied to any historical pagan celebration.  It does not spring from mythology and carries with it very little baggage.  No presents are exchanged; decorations are few and spare; there is little commercial pressure to buy, travel, celebrate, or do anything to excess.  (The possible exceptions are the temptations to overeat and watch too much football.)

	Thanksgiving is a holiday designated by men and women - a day specifically set aside to enjoy friends and family and to ponder our good fortune.  As most of you know, the first Thanksgiving was held in New England - a bountiful feast during which the American forefathers joined with Native Americans to celebrate a good harvest.  This celebration drew a line under a dreadful year of enormous suffering - inadequate food supplies, disease and death. 

	This is a very difficult time for all of us at Enron.  I want to take a few minutes of your time to share with you some of my thoughts - for even now, it is important to count our blessings and recall some of the many things for which we can be thankful.  I am thankful for the way all of you have pulled together each day, doing your best to make the most of a really tough situation.  I am moved by the kind words many of you have shared with me.  I have been impressed by your willingness to look forward, stay the course, and maintain your sense of humor.  Your loyalty and commitment have sustained me during some of our darkest moments.  I am grateful for friends, family, and the opportunity to live and work in a free and open society.  Mostly, I am so very proud of you - your talents, your flexibility, your work ethic, your willingness to hang in there when things seem to be spinning out of control.

	Thanks for constantly reminding me how lucky I am to be working with you.  

	John Sherriff

Subject: Amen, brother


At their annual meeting before the beginning of the football season,
the top southern football programs decided to have Golden phones
installed in each of their respective offices. One day a recruit named
Marcus walked into Jackie Sherrill's Miss. State office and saw his
Golden phone sitting there. "Wow," Marcus exclaimed, "What's that?"
 Jackie responded, "Well son, that's my Golden Phone; it's a direct
line to Heaven. "Wow, that's pretty neat," Marcus responded. "Do
you think I could make a call on that phone?"  "Well yes, but it's
going to cost you about $100. You can make the check out to the
Mississippi State University Football Foundation," replied Jackie.
"That's a lot of money. I don't think I should spend that much.
Thanks anyway," Marcus replied as he left the office.

A few weeks later Marcus took a visit at the campus of Texas
A&M University and went into Coach R. C. Slocum 's office where
again he saw a Golden phone.  "What exactly is that phone for?"
asked Marcus.  Coach Slocum replied, "That's my direct line to
Heaven."   "Do you think I could make a call from that phone?"
asked Marcus.  "Well sure, but it's going to cost you about $200,
and you can make the check out to the Texas A&M University
Foundation." replied Slocum.   "Oh never mind, I don't have that
kind of money. Thanks though."  Marcus shook his head and left
Coach Slocum's office.

The next weekend, Marcus took his official visit to Louisiana State
University campus and made the office of Coach Saban his first stop.
Upon arriving, the first thing Marcus noticed was the Golden phone
on Coach Saban's desk.  Marcus asked if that was a direct line to
Heaven.  When Coach Saban replied that it was, Marcus again asked
if he could make a call using the phone.  "Well sure you can, but it
will cost you 35 cents," replied Saban.  Upon hearing this, Marcus'
eyes got real big and he said, "Really?  Then why did Coach
Sherrill and Coach Slocum tell me it would cost so much more?"
Coach Saban looked up from behind his desk and smiled, saying,
"Because, son, here at LSU, it's a local call."

L S U --- GO TIGERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Where the Hell were you guys last weekend?!  Of course, I saw only 2 of my
pledge brothers (Class of '69).  But, I saw a bunch of the brothers from the
class of '71 (whose 30th Reunion it was - mine was 2 years ago!).  I was
hoping to meet some of you jackoff idiots who I didn't know.  I thought
Chuck Paul was going to be there, but if he was I didn't get to renew -
kai -.

Brother Dent, as another Brother Dent, you may not remember but we finally
met a few years ago at the A@M Student Center when you were having a book
signing before the A@M/ Baylor game and I got you to sign a copy of "The
Junction Boys" for my stepson , Jim Bavouset, who was an Aggie Beta.  We had
a nice long chat remembering some of the times from back in the 70's when
you were the Sports Editor for the Daily Campus and I was working my ass off
over in the corner of the campus in law school.  You gave me a business
card, and I've been remiss in not contacting you since that serindipitous
occasion when I finallly met you.  I hope that you'll acept this - my
apology for not contacting you before now.  I've actually thought about it
several times before now.

So,  after reading all of these posts from all of you guys from classes just
after mine (and it hurts me that more of my own classmates and guys before
me haven't found it appropriate to write on this Board), I'm quite impressed
to see how close all of you guys have remained after all of these years -
just like I was to see all of my good friends and Brothers from the class of
'71 this past weekend.  I saw a few guys I haven't seen in over 25+ years -
and we picked up as if there hadn't been any time that elapsed between.
Damn, it's great to be a BETA!

y'all sure y'all really want me to come home?  i wonder...

i would like to ask all y'all to use your imagination a bit so that i may
make my first attempt at the powerfully tricky and thankless task of
modifying group behavior in the clan sanders.

imagine that you had a massive and grotesquely noticeable birthmark shaped
just like a swastika on your forehead.  any sort of limb will do - the point
is, it is something of which you are always fully and painfully aware.
next, imagine that everyone you love began each conversation with you by
mentioning it, not cognizant of the fact that of course you know about it
and it does not please you to hear the constant refrains asking about it.

exaggeration for effect aside, y'all need to know that answering the
question "when are you coming home" every time i pay a dime to give a holler
back home gets purty doggone tiring.  it ain't at aggravation point yet,
but...  suffice to say i know by now how y'all feel, okay?

of course if YOU should care to ring the good and gentle folk at nippon
telephone and telegraph, you may say whatever you want.  the single
exception to this rule is the Great She-Elephant herself, who not only
retains the right to nag but who also has earned it.  have i bragged about
how much of an uberfrau she has been lately?  truly stalwart stuff - jazz
documentary taped, bitchin' xmas present, and even chunked some green into
the bank for us.  and just this morning took a mate of mine visiting Foat
Wuth for the weekend out for lunch!  Viva Camilla!  or in nipponese, she is
a sugoi oka-san!

but for not listening to my tape of jazz interpretations of broadway musical
tunes (and i KNOW you haven't listened to it, mama), you may step on up and
lend me your eyes, you ol' avocado eatin', bridge masterin', Jerry Jones
hatin', Mansfield escapin', wine spillin', no high (or low) heel wearin',
cookie selling girl scout at the door slammin', nicotine cravin', taxbill
complainin' but no church tithin', chili and rice cookin' old petal!
(apparently that is yorkshirespeak for darling)

well that is enough insults for a spell - got a wee carried away there.
just wanted to say hey to y'all and throw out the following info, namely
that the next visit will come in the autumntime.  colorado is playing UT in
austin on october 21st, and the frivolity of such an aiming point makes it
irresistable.  count on mid to late october unless notified otherwise....

hope this finds all y'all well.  please know that the love flowing from
hereabouts has not abated one iota - if anything, it has the strength of ten
grinches!  keep well -

rollo

Subject: Hangover Classification


Hey JB - You don't how any of these feel do you?
Later - Jenny

Hangover Classification

1 Star Hangover:
 No pain. No real feeling of illness. Your sleep last night was a mere
 disco nap which is giving you a whole lot of misplaced energy. Be  glad
 that you are able to function relatively well. However, you are still
parched. You can drink 10 sodas and still feel this way. Even
vegetarians are craving a steakbomb and a side of gravy fries from any
truck stop USA.

2 Star Hangover:
No pain. Something is definitely amiss. You may look okay but you have
the attention span and mental capacity of a staple gun. The coffee you =
chug
to try and remain focused is only exacerbating your rumbling gut, which =
is craving rootie tootie fresh and fruity pancake breakfast from IHOP. =
Last night has wreaked havoc on your bowels and even though you have a =
nice demeanor about the office, you are costing your employer valuable =
money because all you really can handle is surfing internet porn and =
writing junk e-mails.

3 Star Hangover:
Slight headache. Stomach feels crappy. You are definitely a space shot
and so not productive. Anytime a girl walks by you gag because her =
perfume
reminds you of the random gin shots you did with your alcoholic friends =
after the bouncer 86'd you at 1:45 a.m. Life would be better right now =
if you were in your bed with a dozen donuts and a meatball sub watching =
the E! fashion awards. You've had 4 cups of coffee, a gallon of water, 3 =
Snapples and a liter of diet coke- yet you haven't peed once.

4 Star Hangover:
Life sucks. Your head is throbbing and you can't speak too quickly or
else you might puke. Your boss has already lambasted you for being
late and has given you a lecture for wreaking of booze. You wore nice

You're right, we need to do better at keeping in touch.  Gerald and I live in
the same town, and we still hardly see each other!  Great to hear from you.

I know it's got to be the hardest thing to leave for six months, especially with
the new baby when mama needs you the most.  Do you guys have any family in town
at least?  You're wife is probably involved with a network of military wifes at
least.  It's hard for me to leave for even a couple of days.  The week after
next I am in Dallas for a week of training, that'll be the longest I've been
away.

Well, my wife just went to the movies with my oldest, Sophie (she's four).  I'm
home with my two boys who are both napping, so I actually have a minute to
write.  I am about to make lunch for my neighbor who is from South Africa.  His
family just left for SA for two months, so I'll probably have him over often.
We're about to cook some Elgin sausage, remmeber where that is Paul?  I was in
Austin for work on Friday (drove there) and stopped to get some.  The road trip
was quite eventful: saw a few wreck and one car was even on fire.

You probably don't catch national weather Paul, but we just had a
once-in-a-century storm here in Houston (that's what they're calling it on the
news anyway).  Some places in the Houston area had 35" of rain in the last two
days!  We had about 20" in my area, no flooding though.  Gerald, how did you
fare?  So we've been declares a natural disaster area and all of that.


Other than that, not a whole lot going on.  Work is going well:  I got promoted
in Feb and am in line for another in August, so I can't complain - Frito-Lay is
a good stable company that treats it's employees well.  Let's see what else?
just got a new car that I am excited about.  I had a little Ford Focus 5spd for
my comuter car, but got tired of all of the shifting in traffic on the Beltway.
So I found a 1999 Buick Regal GSE with only 22k on it, in immaculate shape.  I
know, a Buick sounds kinda lame, but as far as Buicks go, this the only one I
would own.  It has leather, sunrfoor, sporty wheels, killer 220-watt stereo,
with a 240HP supercharged engine with room for 5 to boot!  I loaded up the
family and cargo to go to the Valley during Memorial Day, it even got 28 MPG!
Beats the hell out of the 14 or so in the Suburban, with gas prices these days.
Gerald, are you still in the market for a SUV?   I think you were interested in
the Toyota Sequoia or the Acura MDX?  You'd better just stick with the 5-series
Bimmer, I know I would if I were in your shoes!

OK, guys, gotta get to cookin those sausages.  Bieraugel, hang in the there out
at sea and keep us proud!

Ernie and Gerald, well dudes, we're doing just what we said we were not
going to do.  Fall out of touch again.  Here is the latest.  I am out on my
ship for six months now.  We left June 4th and we get back in November.
It's a bitch to be gone from the family for that long but it very busy so it
goes fast for me.  We had our fourth (and probably last) kid on May 13th.
Her name is Chloe Elizabeth.  She is perfect.  My two year old (Kate) was
very surprised when we brought her home.  Carson said he wanted a brother
and Kelly wants to hold her all the time.  You can check some pictures out
at www.geocities.com/pbieraugel.  Take it easy you guys and stay in touch.
Paul.

Bend like a reed in the wind? It's funny you should say that, since I've been 
reading a lot about Buddhist philosophy lately. I stayed with a couple in 
London who practice Buddhist meditation pretty regularly. Ever since then 
I've thought something like that would do a world of good for my mental 
health, being that I've always been more of a giant steel piling than a reed 
when the wind kicks up. I did let her have it, don't worry; but my Catholic 
guilt always gets the best of me, and I assure you I'll be extending all 
kinds of undeserved compassion by this evening.

As far as the sick thing goes - screw that. That's one occasion you cannot 
take lying down, or bending like a reed as it were. You sabotage that thing 
with vitamin C and some uber-multi-vitamin and echinacea and hot water with 
lemon and honey and 14 hours of sleep a night UNTIL IT RUNS SCREAMING FROM 
YOUR BODY. I hate being sick...almost as much as I hate bending like a reed. 

Speaking of Woody Allen - I saw his new one, "Small Time Crooks," last night. 
I'd give it an unenthusiastic "mediocre." Rent it if you've exhausted all 
other options. Tonight I think we're going to check out "Traffic" - I've 
heard rave reviews. Or otherwise it's "Cinema Paradiso" for the 
sixty-thousandth time, but this time on the big screen. The deciding factor 
will be money, and beer. "Traffic" will cost twice as much as "Cinema," but 
the theater showing "Cinema" has comfy couches and serves beer, so I'll end 
up spending twice as much as I would at "Traffic." Do you see the moral 
dilemma here? 

I'm sorry to ramble, but today happens to be alarmingly devoid of surprises. 
Having said that, I'm practically positive some catastrophe will occur in the 
next 30 seconds, so I'm going to go now.

I can't believe that bitch would just wander into the house full of ire and 
phasers set to kill. I hope you let her have it. Some friend! She was just 
trying to get your goat. Knows to how to press your buttons and will continue 
to until she grows up. If I were you I'd follow the Buddhist path--extend 
compassion to her, don't let your state of mind be controlled by what she 
does, bend like a reed in the wind, etc. Anyhoo . . .

I started to get a little sick last night. Think I might have been running a 
fever, so I came home and went to bed early. But I don't always sleep so 
well. The bed I'm?using gives me the distinct impression that I'm sleeping on 
a grade, that I'm slipping into a pit or a valley. My dreams?are always about 
climbing out of things. And then Hector the dachshund sleeps on the bed with 
me and even though he's only about a foot and a half long, it always seems 
like he takes up all the room. Oh, I'm just complaining. Cross your fingers 
that I don't get sick.

"Croupier " I've always wanted to see. Glad you give it the thumbs up. I 
think I'm going to head downstairs and watch a movie myself. Perhaps Woody 
Allen's "Manhattan," an old fave I haven't seen in years.

Talk to you soon. Oh yes, and about the weekend. Of course I give you the 
"flaky"?time allowance you need. I would demand the same for myself. If you 
decide to come down, you don't even have to tell us until Friday or Saturday. 
You don't even have to tell us at all. You could just come and not see us and 
head back Sunday if you want. We are that tolerant of flakiness here. No, 
seriously, if you feel like coming it would be wonderful to see you. If not, 
another time will come.

   Hey Steph!

   I just got back from Italy!  Got a last minute assignment on the 7th to
   travel on the 10th and just returned on the 16th.  It was cool b/c it
   was
   Italy but a longer and less busy trip would have been better!

   How long are Nancy & Michael in town?  I'd love to meet up with yall.

   I've got to tell you that I've got this person who is visiting me this
   weekend (actually Thurs-sun).  He's been a good friend for a long time
   and I
   like him a lot. If I meet up with you guys, I may bring him along if
   that's
   alright.

   I'm going to my grandparents house for Thanksgiving.  Going to be
   strange
   b/c Todd's not there and it's going to be the thing that everyone's
   thinking
   but now saying - you know what I mean?

   My phone #s are 281-483-2241 work and 713-533-9785 home and I can't

   my cell right now.

   We need to do dinner or pre-dinner drinks (or just skip dinner) and

1 star hangover (*)

No pain. No real feeling of illness. Your sleep last night was a mere disco
nap which is giving you a whole lot of misplaced energy.  Be glad that you
are able to function relatively well.   However,you are still parched. You
can drink 10 sodas and still feel this way.  You are craving a steak bomb
and a side of gravy fries.



2 star hangover (**)

No pain, but something is definitely amiss. You may look okay but you have
mental capacity of a staple gun. The coffee you chug is only acerbating
your
rumbling gut, which is craving a rootie tootie fresh and fruity pancake
breakfast from IHOP. Last night has wreaked havoc on your bowels.



3 star hangover (***)

Slight headache. Stomach feels crappy. You are definitely not productive.
Anytime a girl walks by you gag because her perfume reminds you of the
random gin shots you did with your alcoholic friends after the bouncer 86'd
your ass at 1:45 a.m. Life would be better right now if you were in your
bed
with a dozen donuts and a meatball sub You've had 4 cups of coffee, a
gallon
of water, 3 Snapples and a liter of diet coke yet you haven't peed once.



4 star hangover (****)

Life sucks. Your head is throbbing and you can't speak too quickly or else
you might puke. Your boss has already lambasted you for being late and
given
you a lecture for reeking of booze. You wore nice clothes,but that can't
hide the fact that you missed an oh-so crucial spot shaving, (girls,it
looks
like you put your make-up on while riding the bumper cars). Your eyes look
like one big vein and your hair style makes you look like a reject from the
class picture of Revere High, '76.



5 star hangover(*****)

a.k.a. "Dante's 4th Circle of Hell." You have a second heartbeat inyour
head
which is actually annoying the employee who sits in the nextcube.  Vodka
vapor is seeping out of every pore and making you dizzy. You still have
toothpaste crust in the corners of your mouth from brushing your teeth.
Your
body has lost the ability to generate saliva, so your tongue is suffocating
you. Death seems pretty good right now. You definitely don't remember who
you were with, where you were, what you drank, and why there is a stranger
still sleeping in your bed at your house.



6 star hangover (******)

Otherwise known as the "Infinite Nutsmacker"You wake up on your bathroom
floor. For about 2 seconds you look at the ceiling, wondering if the cool
refreshing feeling on your cheek is the bathroom tile or your vomit from 5
hours ago. It is amazing how your roommate who was as drunk as you, but
somehow manages to get up before you the next morning...You try to lift
your
head. Not an option. It is when you turn your head too quickly only to
smell
the funk of 13 packs of cigarettes in your hair, and suddenly you realize
you were smoking, but not ultra lights... some jackass handed you Marlboro
reds, and you smoked them like it was your second full time job. You look
in
the mirror only to see remnants of the stamp "Ready to Rock" faintly atop
your forehead... that explains the stamp on the back of your hand that has
magically appeared on your forehead by alcoholic osmosis. You have to be to
work in t-minus 14 minutes and 32 seconds and the only thing you can think
of wearing is your "hello kitty" pajamas.....

Ever notice how a 4  year old's voice is louder than 200 adult  voices?
----------------------------
Several years ago, I returned home  from a trip just when a storm hit
with crashing thunder and severe lightning.  As I came into my bedroom
about 2 a.m., I found my two children in bed with  my wife, Karey,
apparently scared by the loud storm. I resigned myself to  sleep in the
guest bedroom that night. The next day, I talked to the  children, and
explained that it was O.K. to sleep with Mom when the storm was  bad, but
when I was expected home, please don't sleep with Mom that night.  They
said ok. After my next trip several weeks later, Karey and the  children
picked me up in the terminal at the appointed time. Since the plane  was
late, everyone had come into the terminal to wait for my  plane's
arrival, along with hundreds of other folks waiting for their  arriving
passengers. As I entered the waiting area, my son saw me, and came  running
shouting, "Hi, Dad! I've got some good news!" As I waved back, I  said
loudly, "What's the good news?" "Nobody slept with Mommy while you were  away
this time!" Alex shouted. The
airport became very quiet, as everyone  in the waiting area looked at
Alex, then turned to me, and then searched the  rest of the area to see
if they could figure out exactly who his Mom  was.
----------------------------
An acquaintance of mine who is a  physician told this story about her
then 4 yr. old daughter. On the way to  preschool, the doctor had left
her stethoscope on the car seat, and her  little girl picked it up and
began playing with it. 'Be still, my heart,'  thought my friend, 'my daughter
wants to follow in my footsteps!'
Then the  child spoke into the instrument: "Welcome to McDonald's. May I
take your  order?"
-----------------
A certain little girl, when asked her name,  would reply, "I'm Mr.
Sugarbrown's daughter." Her mother told her this was  wrong, she must
say, "I'm Jane Sugarbrown." The pastor spoke to her in Sunday  School,
and said, "Aren't you Mr. Sugarbrown's daughter?" She replied,  "I
thought I was, but mother says I'm not."
-----------------
A Sunday  school teacher asked her little children, as they were on the
way to church  service, "And why is it necessary to be quiet in church?"
One bright little  girl replied,"Because people are sleeping."
-----------------
At the  beginning of a children's sermon, one girl came up to the altar
wearing a  beautiful dress. As the children were sitting down around the
pastor, he  leaned over and said to the girl, "That is a very pretty
dress. Is it your  Easter dress?" The girl replied almost directly into
the pastor's clip-on  mike, "Yes, and
my Mom says it's a bitch to  iron."
-----------------
And my personal favorite --- A little girl goes  to the barber shop with
her father. She stands next to the barber chair,  while her dad gets his
hair cut, eating a snack cake. The barber says to her,  "Sweetheart,
you're gonna get hair on your Twinkie." She says, "Yes, I know,  and I'm
gonna get boobs too."

Subject: Re: [smu-betas] 76ers - it's time to hump it

Where the Hell were you guys last weekend?!  Of course, I saw only 2 of my
pledge brothers (Class of '69).  But, I saw a bunch of the brothers from the
class of '71 (whose 30th Reunion it was - mine was 2 years ago!).  I was
hoping to meet some of you jackoff idiots who I didn't know.  I thought
Chuck Paul was going to be there, but if he was I didn't get to renew -
kai -.

Brother Dent, as another Brother Dent, you may not remember but we finally
met a few years ago at the A@M Student Center when you were having a book
signing before the A@M/ Baylor game and I got you to sign a copy of "The
Junction Boys" for my stepson , Jim Bavouset, who was an Aggie Beta.  We had
a nice long chat remembering some of the times from back in the 70's when
you were the Sports Editor for the Daily Campus and I was working my ass off
over in the corner of the campus in law school.  You gave me a business
card, and I've been remiss in not contacting you since that serindipitous
occasion when I finallly met you.  I hope that you'll acept this - my
apology for not contacting you before now.  I've actually thought about it
several times before now.

So,  after reading all of these posts from all of you guys from classes just
after mine (and it hurts me that more of my own classmates and guys before
me haven't found it appropriate to write on this Board), I'm quite impressed
to see how close all of you guys have remained after all of these years -
just like I was to see all of my good friends and Brothers from the class of
'71 this past weekend.  I saw a few guys I haven't seen in over 25+ years -
and we picked up as if there hadn't been any time that elapsed between.
Damn, it's great to be a BETA!

All right Shack.  The picture is making me respond to these diatribes, seeing how my puss is front and center in the photo.  (By the way how many of you old farts from '75 can name the others in the picture?) 
I get the impression that you all think -kai- is dead among the class of '76.  That is absolute bulls**t!  I still see many of my pledge brothers on a regular basis as well as many of you "older" Betas.  (Had dinner with John Miller last night - and he even paid!) 
My home has always been and will always be open to any Beta who gets his ass to Dallas (except Drow cause he's already here). 
In fact, the SMU class of '76 is indeed hosting a stunning event for alums this Saturday night at the Highland Park estate (on Beverly Drive) of some SAE that I never heard of (apparently a member of the "lucky sperm club")  There will be valet parking and more SAE and Phi Delt alums than you can shake a stick at.  They will be all sitting around with their trophy wifes talking about the size of their Porches and bond portfolios (since they all got out of the stock market 18 months ago).  All this for only 75 bucks.  Hmmm, do I want to go there and enjoy a lovely evening with my fellow classmates, or do I want to walk over one block to Mark Paul's and listen to you whiners that have the wherewithall to make it to Dallas bitch and moan about the '76 pledge class.  Could be a tough decision. 
If it wasn't for Beek and Elvis last year, I suspect that you members of the '75 class would have been sitting at home watching reruns of Cartoon Carnival (right Arends?). 
Just remember it was the wisdom and vision of all you whiners that put the guys in that picture together (right C-Paul?)  So quit bitchin and get to Dallas this weekend.  We'll figure out something fun to do!

Last year the class of 75 held the only DORG recorded in University Park history; initiated the firstest and onlyest EWogolin.com; manned a Beta tent with more people than the class of 74, 75 & 76 combined; were banned from O'jedas for 1 year for just being us and still had room for cocktails at the Mules house on Sunday morning. 
You guys are pathetic - No worse, you guys are geese.

Subject:  Prescott Case

This is interesting - the other side of the story.  Those Beavs aren't such
bad boys!  -K




Interesting reading from someone calling himself "Grackle" on the Beaver
Dam at Beaver Sport Central.  Here's what he had to say regarding the
Prescott
trial:

I've attended much of the trial and here are the pertinent facts:

1. Victor Becerra, the accuser/victim: (a) lied about how much he drank
that night-- for example he told the attending doctor at Good Sam (where he
had
his battered face treated) that he'd had half a beer that night. He also
told the grand jury that he'd had "at most a beer" before going over to
the party where the fight occurred. In fact, witnesses testified that he'd
one
beer AND consumed at very potent mixed drink (a "consuelo")-- a consuelo
(Corey here, El Presidente' makes the best consuelos in Corvallis)
consists of SIX shots of vodka mixed with juice or the like.

2) Becerra also lied about not having struck any blows. Not only did he
strike blows, he struck FIRST and suffered the consequences. First,
Becerra pushed Prescott after telling him that he and his "boys"
(Prescott's
friends at the party-Junior Addams, Newsom, Weathersby) were't welcome at
the
party-Prescott then decked him AFTER more less pawing at Becerra twice to
get him out of his face (in between Prescott's mild pawing at Becerra,
Becerra taunted him by telling Prescott he hit like "a bitch").
Subsequently, things died down for a minute or so, and then Becerra
proceeded to ambush a VERY drunk Addams who, at that time, was bending
down to fix his shoe (previously, Addams had not been involved in any
physical
confrontation). Just exactly what did Becerra do to Adams? He grabbed him
by the head and kneed him in the face-knocking Adams down and splitting his
lip. Then, all hell broke loose-with many people fighting each other and
with Becerra getting the worst of it -- kicked and punched. ALL of these
facts are in the testimony from reliable witnesses and the DA doesn't even
deny any longer that Becerra was the aggressor.

3) My conclusion: First, Becerra only got what he asked for by kneeing
Adams in the face with no provocation from Addams. The fact that Addams'
friends
beat the heck out of Becerra for the cheapshot was the risk Becerra took
for cheapshotting Adams in the first place. Charges should NEVER have been
brought (the thing was a brawl started by Becerra), but since they were,
why wasn't Becerra charged with assault as well?

4) A coach today told me that this case has already hurt recruiting-the
word's out that Corvallis will go after blacks and prosecute them before
running a really thorough investigation. I agree-this case should NEVER
have been prosecuted and since it was, why weren't the non-blacks involved
charged as well?? This is something we all need to be concerned about. I
intend to write the District Attorney (Heiser) expressing my opinion on
the matter.

Bitching is what I do, so I will continue to bitch.  Please look us up some

we need to leave at 4 am or so to make it to the border.

1 star hangover (*)

No pain. No real feeling of illness. Your sleep last night was a mere disco
nap which is giving you a whole lot of misplaced energy.  Be glad that you
are able to function relatively well.   However,you are still parched. You
can drink 10 sodas and still feel this way.  You are craving a steak bomb
and a side of gravy fries.



2 star hangover (**)

No pain, but something is definitely amiss. You may look okay but you have
mental capacity of a staple gun. The coffee you chug is only acerbating
your
rumbling gut, which is craving a rootie tootie fresh and fruity pancake
breakfast from IHOP. Last night has wreaked havoc on your bowels.



3 star hangover (***)

Slight headache. Stomach feels crappy. You are definitely not productive.
Anytime a girl walks by you gag because her perfume reminds you of the
random gin shots you did with your alcoholic friends after the bouncer 86'd
your ass at 1:45 a.m. Life would be better right now if you were in your
bed
with a dozen donuts and a meatball sub You've had 4 cups of coffee, a
gallon
of water, 3 Snapples and a liter of diet coke yet you haven't peed once.



4 star hangover (****)

Life sucks. Your head is throbbing and you can't speak too quickly or else
you might puke. Your boss has already lambasted you for being late and
given
you a lecture for reeking of booze. You wore nice clothes,but that can't
hide the fact that you missed an oh-so crucial spot shaving, (girls,it
looks
like you put your make-up on while riding the bumper cars). Your eyes look
like one big vein and your hair style makes you look like a reject from the
class picture of Revere High, '76.



5 star hangover(*****)

a.k.a. "Dante's 4th Circle of Hell." You have a second heartbeat inyour
head
which is actually annoying the employee who sits in the nextcube.  Vodka
vapor is seeping out of every pore and making you dizzy. You still have
toothpaste crust in the corners of your mouth from brushing your teeth.
Your
body has lost the ability to generate saliva, so your tongue is suffocating
you. Death seems pretty good right now. You definitely don't remember who
you were with, where you were, what you drank, and why there is a stranger
still sleeping in your bed at your house.



6 star hangover (******)

Otherwise known as the "Infinite Nutsmacker"You wake up on your bathroom
floor. For about 2 seconds you look at the ceiling, wondering if the cool
refreshing feeling on your cheek is the bathroom tile or your vomit from 5
hours ago. It is amazing how your roommate who was as drunk as you, but
somehow manages to get up before you the next morning...You try to lift
your
head. Not an option. It is when you turn your head too quickly only to
smell
the funk of 13 packs of cigarettes in your hair, and suddenly you realize
you were smoking, but not ultra lights... some jackass handed you Marlboro
reds, and you smoked them like it was your second full time job. You look
in
the mirror only to see remnants of the stamp "Ready to Rock" faintly atop
your forehead... that explains the stamp on the back of your hand that has
magically appeared on your forehead by alcoholic osmosis. You have to be to
work in t-minus 14 minutes and 32 seconds and the only thing you can think
of wearing is your "hello kitty" pajamas.....

Dear Ernesto , 

Welcome to the pleasure of planning an event for your asshole friends.
This has been a long standing tradition that the person that gets sucked or suckered
into planning an outing for the group gets bitched at non stop until the event happens.
The next step is "the event" that will be the turning point of this bitching.
There are two outcomes,
1.	Everyone has a good time and you will bitch back and it will be lessened to good friendly humor
2.	Everyone is pissed b/c they drove 100 miles , they play bad and blame you for picking a bad place to
	play, they kill you and bury you in a sand trap on the number 12 hole , finish the round and never mention
	your name again.

All I have to say Ernie is good luck on everyone play GOLF well this Sunday.

Live the next few days to the fullest , they might be your last.

Long live Ernesto

Dutch

Please read the message below (from Mark).  He asked about it, I looked it
up and got us a tee time.  If anybody wants to get a tee time somewhere
else, that is fine with me.  Just let me know so that I can cancel the tee
times in Kingwood.

With Richard playing and the boys from Austin playing, I think that Kingwood
is a happy medium.  We could try Brock park if that's what you guys want.
Who the hell lives by Brock?  I actually think that the drive to Kingwood is
better than the drive into 5th ward or whatever ward it is.

I don't mind making a drive to play in Austin or Beaumont or Katy.  It's
golf!!!!

No.  They have a tournament on Sunday morning.  Their first available tee
time is 1:15.
Damn, and I was hoping Mark would wear his Hillrod wig.

Sorry, any other suggestions?

Hey again!
Thanks for the quick response!  Damn!  Anyway, I'm bummed that you don't
have your ticket down here for that weekend, but there are PLENTY of other
weekends to come visit.  I'll be here for a while.  We'll plan something
soon.  I think that weekend I may ask for a couple days off and drive up to
Bend.  I wonder if it's cheaper to drive than to fly?  I'll let you know
what I'm doing and maybe you can come down and visit...or I'll be up in
Portland soon anyway.

Sooooo - Your house sounds SO awesome!  That's such a cool neighborhood,
too!  I can't believe you're moving on Friday.  I know what you mean about
things like that sucking all of your money away.  kate, I'm sooo sick of my
job these days.  I'm seriously going to spend my weekend looking for fun
things to do with my life.  I really want to be a massage therapist!  How
fun would that be.  I just want to do something that I like doing and not
something that i have to do because i need money.  I guess I need money
anyway, but it's brutal!

We are too young for this I swear.  If you're ever ready to move somewhere
exotic, let me know.  I'm down to go whenever!  It's funny that you said you
look like a real-life ash tray...I seriously got out of my car this morning
on my way to work and caught a glimpse of myself in the window reflection
and had to stop and drop my jaw.  I seriously look like a puffy-eyed old
hag!  Its highly disturbing.  I'm calling my hairdresser NOW to make an
appointment for a cut and color.  :)  don't i sound so cheesy?  I love it!

So write me soon!  How's amber doing?  Still with that new guy, malcom?  :)
Hows your boy life?  Any prospects?

Write more soon!  I'm bored.

Love ya!
Joan

Joaner Boner -
Well, in my usual slacker fashion, I haven't bought my plane ticket yet -
so I totally think you should go to Sunriver. I might come visit you there
if there's room. But an S.F. visit is imminent, I swear. I'll call you soon
to discuss the alcoholism of your co-worker/boyfriend, as well as the
techniques for acquiring this sexy body for the new year. Work is consuming
my life and eating me whole - very chaotic what with hiding all the power
from you guys and whatnot. Imagine the pressure. Another reason it might
not be the best time for me to come is that I'm moving on Friday. Amber and
Molly and I found a big, beautiful house in NE, near Grant High - it's
kickass. But it's sucked away all of my money and will probably take over
every free moment for the next month just to get it set up. If you want,
you should stop by for a sleep over on your way to Bend. We'll throw a
party. And what's up with the wrist disease? Are you not taking your
calcium or something? I'm convinced that these wacky desk jobs are aging us
youthful beauties prematurely. At least that's the excuse I like to give
when I come in to work looking like I just bathed in a life-sized ashtray.
Call me soon - I'm really curious to find out why Brooks is doing the
chicken dance EVER let alone in your room in the middle of the night.
Wheeew!

Happy Sexy Body New Year,
Kate

Subject:  Sexy Body for the New Year!!!


Hey Kate -
My subject line is a duplicate of an email I received this morning from
some
beauty .com site.  Steve Cross puts me on all of these stupid mailing
lists,
so I thought I'd be retarded and put that in my subject line because it's a
stupid subject!

Anyway, how are you doing these days?  I wanted to write and see if you
really got your ticket to come visit over President's Day weekend!  I
totally want you to come down!!!  I'd be so excited.  If you don't, though,
I think I'm going to look into going up to Bend for the weekend to chill in
SunRiver and snowboard a little!  Maybe you could meet me there and stay w/
me at my parents house?  Ash is going up for sure.  If you're coming down
here, that's GREAT!  I'd be SOOO excited.

I'm on complete crack today, if you can't tell.  I have carpal tunnell,
too.
Last night I woke up at 2am to Brooks coming home from a drunken night out
and he started doing the chicken dance in my room and almost knocked over
my
entire shelf, tv, etc.  Then he started babbling about nothing, passed
straight out and started totally snoring.  So I didn't get back to sleep
until like 4:30 and had to wake up at 6.  I was livid this morning.  I'm
such a bitch, but I need my sleep!  Dammit.

Anyway, write soon!   I miss you!

Body:
Yo Lenny,
Glad you finally pulled your big head out of Chemosabe's ass and decided to
chat with us.  Thanks for looking us up when you came to New Orleans, I
guess since none of us drink Jamison and wack off to the Sundance film
festival we're not cool...

Anyways, thanks for letting us stay at your maw's place when we go skiing.
Yes I'm going bald but your maw said that if you look good with hair then
you'll look good without it- so this year I'll shave my sack as an added
bonus...  Don't worry about saving for me a place to sleep, I'll just make a
matress out of dog hair from those slobbering, gaseous, farting bulldogs
your maw has.

Wish you were coming on the ski trip, but I realize the gay olympic trials
are in South Beach at the same time, so I understand.  Hope you qualify.

cjrob

> >  NOTE: Please take  time to read this slowly. If you pay attention to the first two judges, the reaction of the third is even better.

This is what it is like for the poor sap that is in charge of softball, flag football, etc.  Kingwood is fine for me.  You did a fine job Ernie.  Remember you can't please everyone, especially our group of bitchers.

>>> "Quigley, Dutch" <Dutch.Quigley@ENRON.com> 11/08/01 07:17AM >>>
Dear Ernesto ,

Welcome to the pleasure of planning an event for your asshole friends.
This has been a long standing tradition that the person that gets sucked
or suckered
into planning an outing for the group gets bitched at non stop until the
event happens.
The next step is "the event" that will be the turning point of this
bitching.
There are two outcomes,
1.	Everyone has a good time and you will bitch back and it will be
lessened to good friendly humor
2.	Everyone is pissed b/c they drove 100 miles , they play bad and
blame you for picking a bad place to
	play, they kill you and bury you in a sand trap on the number 12
hole , finish the round and never mention
	your name again.

All I have to say Ernie is good luck on everyone play GOLF well this
Sunday.

Live the next few days to the fullest , they might be your last.

Long live Ernesto

Dutch

             The Top 15 New U.S. Army Weapons for 2001


15> The Britney Spear -- A deadly assault weapon with razor sharp,
    retractable twelve inch nipples which reduce men to drooling
    idiots.

14> R-23 Multi-Environment Inhalation Assistance Device for
    Short-Term, Repeatable Infantry Stimulus -- Okay, it's
    actually just a $750 crack pipe.

13> RoboReagan -- Oh, come on.  Did you *really* think he was
    hospitalized for a broken hip?

12> The Heche Bomb -- Rather than killing countless civilians like
    its thermonuclear predecessor, detonation of this warhead
    simply bewilders the enemy by wandering amongst them, knocking
    on their doors and making strange remarks.

11> Compassionate Carbine -- Kills just as effectively, but a
    small sound chip in the stock says, "I'm sorry" with each
    bullet fired.

10> Ultra Anthrax Plus -- Similar to regular Anthrax, but with
    a hint of lemon for a clean, refreshing scent!

 9> Sharkbomb -- Fills the target area with thousands attorneys,
    leaving it bogged down by legal haggling.

 8> Army of One -- Pvt. First Class Frank Richards will be
    dispatched to finally eliminate those pesky Iraqis.
    We expect him to be far more effective than a full dose
    of the Army, without all of the unpleasant side effects.

 7> The Atomic Balm -- Deadly Chapstick that comes in three
    luminescent colors:  Irradiated Iraq Indigo, Glowing
    Gorky Green and Malignant Mao Mauve

 6> Land Mimes -- Will repulse, frustrate and anger the enemy;
    now with potent "trapped in a box" mechanism.

 5> "Star Wars" Defense System - Network of ground- and orbital-
    based weapons designed to prevent George Lucas from entering
    U.S. airspace with another lame "prequel."

 4> SHDI (Strategic Hairpiece Defense Initiative) -- Uses
    satellite laser technology to track Sam Donaldson.

 3> Don't Ask Don't Telegraph -- Global communication without
    leaving the closet!

 2> The Subliminable Obsiconfusionary Mispronunciator -- Confuses
    foreign leaders by introducing gibberish into speeches.
    Best of all, it's stealthiable.



 and Topfive.com's Number 1 New U.S. Army Weapon for 2001...


 1> The Lewinsky Land Mine -- Get anywhere near it and it'll
    blow your nuts off.

>>
>> >>
>>
>> >>These are notes from an inexperienced chili taster named FRANK, who was
>>
>> >>visiting Texas from New Jersey and fell into it:
>>
>> >>
>>
>> >>"Recently I was lucky enough to be the 10,000th attendee at the State
>>
>> >>Fair in Texas, and was asked to fill in to be a judge
>>
>> >>at a chili cook-off. Apparently the original judge #3 called in sick at
>>
>> >>the last moment, and I happened to be standing
>>
>> >>there when the call came in. I was assured by the other two judges
>>
>> >>(Native Texans) that it would be a fun event and a true
>>
>> >>taste of Texas hospitality. They assured me that the chili wouldn't be
>>
>> >>all that spicy, and besides they told me I could
>>
>> >>have free beer during the tasting, so I accepted. Here are the
>>
>> >>scorecards from the event:
>>
>> >>
>>
>> >>Chili # 1: Mike's Maniac Mobster Monster Chili
>>
>> >>
>>
>> >>JUDGE ONE: A little too heavy on tomato. Amusing kick.
>>
>> >>JUDGE TWO: Nice, smooth tomato flavor. Very mild.
>>
>> >>FRANK: Holy shit, what the hell is this stuff? You could remove dried
>>
>> >>paint from your driveway with it. Took me two beers
>>
>> >>to put the flames out. Hope that's the worst one. These Texans are
>>
>> >>crazy.
>>
>> >>
>>
>> >>Chili # 2: Arthur's Afterburner Chili
>>
>> >>
>>
>> >>JUDGE ONE: Smoky, with a hint of pork. Slight Jalapeno tang.
>>
>> >>JUDGE TWO: Exciting BBQ flavor, needs more peppers to be taken
>>
>> >>seriously.
>>
>> >>FRANK: Keep this out of reach of children! I'm not sure what I am
>>
>> >>supposed to taste besides pain. I had to wave off two
>>
>> >>people who wanted to give me the Heimlich maneuver. They had to
>>
>> >>walkie-talkie in 3 extra beers when they saw the look on my face.
>>
>> >>
>>
>> >> Chili # 3: Fred's Famous Burn Down the Barn Chili
>>
>> >>
>>
>> >>JUDGE ONE: Excellent firehouse chili! Great kick. Needs more beans.
>>
>> >>JUDGE TWO: A beanless chili, a bit salty, good use of red peppers.
>>
>> >>FRANK: Call the EPA, I've located a uranium spill. My nose feels like I
>>
>> >>
>>
>> >>have been snorting Drano. Everyone knows the
>>
>> >>routine by now. Barmaid pounded me on the back; now my backbone is in
>>
>> >>the front part of my chest. 'm getting shit-faced.
>>
>> >>
>>
>> >> Chili # 4: Bubba's Black Magic
>>
>> >>
>>
>> >>JUDGE ONE: Black bean chili with almost no spice. Disappointing.
>>
>> >>JUDGE TWO: Hint of lime in the black beans. Good side dish for fish or
>>
>> >>other mild foods, not much of a chili.
>>
>> >>FRANK: I felt something scraping across my tongue, but was unable to

who told you if you look good with hair you will look good without it?  that sounds like a george costanza.  hair is important to women under 45.  i wish i could make this ski trip and see you in action again, but south beach calls.

Yo Lenny,
Glad you finally pulled your big head out of Chemosabe's ass and decided to
chat with us.  Thanks for looking us up when you came to New Orleans, I
guess since none of us drink Jamison and wack off to the Sundance film
festival we're not cool...

Anyways, thanks for letting us stay at your maw's place when we go skiing.
Yes I'm going bald but your maw said that if you look good with hair then
you'll look good without it- so this year I'll shave my sack as an added
bonus...  Don't worry about saving for me a place to sleep, I'll just make a
matress out of dog hair from those slobbering, gaseous, farting bulldogs
your maw has.

Wish you were coming on the ski trip, but I realize the gay olympic trials
are in South Beach at the same time, so I understand.  Hope you qualify.

cjrob

>>
>> >>
>>
>> >>"Recently I was lucky enough to be the 10,000th attendee at the State

>>
>> >>at a chili cook-off. Apparently the original judge #3 called in sick at

>>

>>

>>
>> >>all that spicy, and besides they told me I could
>>
>> >>have free beer during the tasting, so I accepted. Here are the
>>
>> >>scorecards from the event:
>>
>> >>
>>
>> >>Chili # 1: Mike's Maniac Mobster Monster Chili
>>
>> >>
>>
>> >>JUDGE ONE: A little too heavy on tomato. Amusing kick.
>>
>> >>JUDGE TWO: Nice, smooth tomato flavor. Very mild.
>>
>> >>FRANK: Holy shit, what the hell is this stuff? You could remove dried
>>
>> >>paint from your driveway with it. Took me two beers
>>
>> >>to put the flames out. Hope that's the worst one. These Texans are
>>
>> >>crazy.
>>
>> >>
>>
>> >>Chili # 2: Arthur's Afterburner Chili
>>
>> >>
>>
>> >>JUDGE ONE: Smoky, with a hint of pork. Slight Jalapeno tang.
>>
>> >>JUDGE TWO: Exciting BBQ flavor, needs more peppers to be taken
>>
>> >>seriously.
>>
>> >>FRANK: Keep this out of reach of children! I'm not sure what I am
>>
>> >>supposed to taste besides pain. I had to wave off two
>>
>> >>people who wanted to give me the Heimlich maneuver. They had to
>>
>> >>walkie-talkie in 3 extra beers when they saw the look on my face.
>>
>> >>
>>
>> >> Chili # 3: Fred's Famous Burn Down the Barn Chili
>>
>> >>
>>
>> >>JUDGE ONE: Excellent firehouse chili! Great kick. Needs more beans.
>>
>> >>JUDGE TWO: A beanless chili, a bit salty, good use of red peppers.
>>
>> >>FRANK: Call the EPA, I've located a uranium spill. My nose feels like I
>>
>> >>
>>
>> >>have been snorting Drano. Everyone knows the
>>
>> >>routine by now. Barmaid pounded me on the back; now my backbone is in
>>
>> >>the front part of my chest. 'm getting shit-faced.
>>
>> >>
>>
>> >> Chili # 4: Bubba's Black Magic
>>
>> >>
>>
>> >>JUDGE ONE: Black bean chili with almost no spice. Disappointing.
>>
>> >>JUDGE TWO: Hint of lime in the black beans. Good side dish for fish or
>>
>> >>other mild foods, not much of a chili.
>>
>> >>FRANK: I felt something scraping across my tongue, but was unable to

Number 2 is the good stuff, sounds like a Sal maneuver.

Jeff, I'm sorry my parents did that last night.  I will ask them not to do
that again.  And I am not upset about us not getting married or moving in
together.  I would like for our relationship to evolve and grow into
something like that.  All I was saying is that we have a communication
problem if you think we've talked about it and I don't think we have.  If I
ever thought you wanted me to move in with you, I would have done it.  That
has nothing to do with selling my house.  But I'm not upset about it either.
You seem to be putting a lot of words in my mouth in this email about what I
want that I'm not telling you about and none of it is true.

But most importantly, I was NOT calling you a liar or an asshole.  When I
said honest, I was talking about being straightforward and communicating in
a way that doesn't make me have to guess what you're really saying.  It had
nothing to do with lying and I never accused you of lying.  I hope you
understand that.  And I certainly never EVER called you an asshole last
night.  Jeff, I really don't think this has to be an argument.  But it's
very sad to me that you don't think we care enough about each other to be
committed to this relationship.  That's a pretty serious blow.

Prentice:
I'm happy to talk.  However, if you're unhappy because 1) I haven't asked
you to marry me, or 2) I haven't asked you to move in together, or 3) I
haven't asked you to have children, then you need to say so.  I'm very
upset to think that the only time I hear what you feel, or what your mother
believes you feel, or what your father believes you feel, is when we're
having dinner with your parents and they impose their limited view of our
relationship on the situation.  I'm not interested in debating my personal
relationship with you with your parents as a substitute for our
communicating---that's not a relationship.  Nor am I interested in living
my life according to what your parents or my parents or anyone else's
parents wish they'd done.  If I had ever had someone call you the way
Cameron called me on Saturday night, you would have screamed at me for
days.  Yet, when it's the other way, there's always a difference, always a
reason.  It seems like rather than communicate we are continually engaged
in a rhetorical exercise.  It 's very upsetting, and it's the sort of
one-way street that has me so deeply depressed about how we interact.

If you feel that I'm dishonest, or too dominant or not committed to the
relationship, then you need to say so---I shouldn't have to hear it in
vague terms from your parents over dinner.  And if you want to move in
together, or get married, or have children, then perhaps it would be
constructive for you to say so, and offer ways in which we would make that
happen.  From my perspective, all you've ever considered is 1) not selling
your house---for a variety of reasons that I don't understand or 2) buying
another place with Cameron.  But I'm not dating you and your sister, I'm
dating you.  So it seems to me that if you were committed to it, you would
search a solution.  Instead, it seems to me, none of those things occur,
but I'm an asshole for not having moved in with you, or married you or had
children with you.  That's lose-lose and everyone can call me an asshole,
but it won't change things.

It seems to me that two things have to happen for people to make a
commitment.  First, they have to care for each other, and the way we
interact, it's hard to say objectively that we pass that hurdle.  You have
frequently asked your parents to stop arguing, that it upsets you too much,
but that's what we spend most of our time doing.  Second, each person has
to be emotionally mature enough to undertake the responsibilities that come
with the commitment.  I've always wanted to be your partner, not your older
brother, and not your father.  I want an equal partnership where both
individuals are pouring into the relationship, even when it's difficult,
even when it's inconvenient.   If you're looking for a different dynamic in
a relationship, then we need to get it clear.  I don't think we pass these
two hurdles and so I don't think we're quite ready for the commitment,
though I've been working hard at trying to get there, and think we could.
But if we're not ready, I'm not going to do it to please your parents or my
parents or anyone else.

We can talk all day long about what an asshole I am, but I'm not willing to
do that anymore.  And if that's a requirement, then I will fail and we
shouldn't waste our time.  It takes two, pure and simple.  I'm very sorry
that work is overwhelming right now and that I go to school and am in the
process of fulfilling something I've always wanted to do--have property on
the coast.  If you feel that we can't have the relationship you want or
need because of my schedule, then you need to tell me.

If you want to talk about these issues, that's great, but I just feel that
"you never said this,"  and "no, this is what I said," and all the spinning
and debating is a diversion that doesn't get to the real issues.   I was
very upset that after the conversation we had with your parents, which I am
very unhappy about, you call to me I lied  about something.  After this
long, if you want to discuss my dishonesty, then I think we need to take a
hard look at why we're in this at all.  So I'm happy to talk, but not on
the phone, and not about who's the bigger asshole, or who's a lying
son-of-a-bitch.

Subject: "Texas Chili"



I have it on good authority that this is a true story; A True Texas Story: 



???????????????These are notes from an inexperienced chili 
taster named FRANK, who was visiting Texas from New Jersey... 
"Recently I was lucky enough to be the 10,000th attendee at the State 
Fair in Texas and was asked to fill in to be a judge at a chili 
cook-off. ??Apparently the original Judge #3 called in sick at the 
last moment, and I happened to be standing there when the call came 
in. ?I was assured by the other two judges (Native Texans) that it 
would be a fun event and a true taste of Texas hospitality. ?They 
assured me that the chili wouldn't be all that spicy, and besides, 
they told me I could have free beer during the tasting, so I 
accepted. ?Here are the scorecards from the event." 

???*****Chili # 1: Mike's Maniac Mobster Monster Chili 
???????????????????????JUDGE ONE: A little too heavy on tomato. 
Amusing kick. 
???????????????JUDGE TWO: Nice, smooth tomato flavor. Very 
mild. 
???????????????FRANK: Holy shit, what the hell is this stuff? You 
could remove dried paint from your driveway with it. Took me two 
beers to put the flames out. ?Hope that's the worst one. These Texans 
are crazy  
???*****Chili # 2: Arthur's Afterburner Chili 

???????????????JUDGE ONE: Smoky, with a hint of pork. Slight 
Jalapeno tang. 
???????????????JUDGE TWO: Exciting BBQ flavor, needs more peppers to 
be taken seriously. 
???????????????FRANK: Keep this out of reach of children! 
I'm not sure what I am supposed to taste besides pain. I had to wave 
off two people who wanted to give me the Heimlich maneuver. They had 
to walkie-talkie in 3 extra beers when they saw the look on my face. 

???*****Chili # 3: Fred's Famous Burn Down the Barn Chili 

???????????????JUDGE ONE: Excellent firehouse chili! Great kick. 
Needs more beans. 
???????????????JUDGE TWO: A beanless chili, a bit salty,good use of 
red peppers. 
???????????????FRANK: Call the EPA, I've located a uranium spill.  
My nose feels like I have been snorting Drano. Everyone knows the 
routine by now. ?Barmaid pounded me on the back; now my backbone is 
in the front part of my chest. ?I'm getting shit-faced. 

??????*****Chili # 4: Bubba's Black Magic 

???????????????JUDGE ONE: Black bean chili with almost no spice.  
Disappointing. 
???????????????JUDGE TWO: Hint of lime in the black beans. Good side 
dish for fish or other mild foods, not much of a chili. 
???????????????FRANK: I felt something scraping across my tongue, 
but was unable to taste it. ?Sally, the bar maid, was standing 
behind me with fresh refills; that 300 lb. bitch is starting to look 
HOT,just like this nuclear-waste I'm eating. 

?????*****Chili # 5: Linda's Lethal Lip Remover 

???????????????JUDGE ONE: Meaty, strong chili. Cayenne peppers 
freshly ground, adding considerable kick. Very impressive. 
???????????????JUDGE TWO: Chili using shredded beef; could use more 
tomato. ?Must admit the cayenne peppers make a strong statement. 
???????????????FRANK: My ears are ringing, and I can no longer focus 
my eyes. ?I farted and four people behind me burst into flames. 
The contestant seemed offended when I told her that her chili had 
given me brain damage. ?Sally saved my tongue from bleeding by 
pouring beer directly on it from a pitcher. ?It really pisses me off 
that the other judges asked me to stop screaming. ?Screw those 
rednecks! 

?????????*****Chili # 6: Vera's Very Vegetarian Variety 

???????????????JUDGE ONE: Thin yet bold vegetarian variety chili.  
Good balance of spice and peppers. 
???????????????JUDGE TWO: The best yet. ?Aggressive use of peppers, 
onions, and garlic. ?Superb. ? 
???????????????FRANK: My intestines are now a straight-pipe filled 
with gaseous, sulfuric flames. ?No one seems inclined to stand behind 
me except that slut Sally. ?I need to wipe my ass with a snow cone! 

?????????***Chili # 7: Susan's Screaming Sensation Chili 

???????????????JUDGE ONE: A mediocre chili with too much reliance on 
canned peppers. 
???????????????JUDGE TWO: Ho Hum, tastes as if the chef literally 
threw in a can of chili peppers at the last moment. I should note 
that I am worried about Judge Number 3. He appears to be in a bit of 
distress as he is cursing uncontrollably. 
???????????????FRANK: You could put a grenade in my mouth, pull the 
pin, and I wouldn't feel a damn thing. I've lost the sight in one 
eye, and the world sounds like it is made of rushing water. My shirt 
is covered with chili that slid unnoticed out of my mouth. My pants 
are full of lava-like shit to match my damn shirt. At least during 
the autopsy they'll know what killed me. ?I've decided to stop 
breathing. ?It's too painful. ?Screw it! ?I'm not getting any anyway. 
If I need air, I'll just suck it in through the 4-inch hole in my 
stomach. 

???????????????*****Chili # 8: Helen's Mount Saint Chili 

???????????????JUDGE ONE: A perfect ending... this is a nice blend 
chili, safe for all, not too bold but spicy enough to declare its 
existence. 
???????????????JUDGE TWO: This final entry is a good, balanced 
chili, neither mild nor hot. ?Sorry to see that most of it was lost 
when Judge Number 3 passed out, fell and pulled the chili pot on top 
of himself. ?Not sure if he's going to make it. ?Poor Yank.

                         NOTE FROM CHRIS:

             According to a book written by a former
           Cambridge University researcher, a parrot in
            Manhattan can read the mind of its owner.

               "But Chris," you say, "How do I know
                if MY pet has psychic abilities?"
              Fear not!  Here's how you can tell...


           The Top 13 Signs Your Pet Can Read Your Mind


13> You think about having him neutered and the next time you're
    taking a bath, Rover brings you the toaster.

12> They start throwing feces before you even get the typewriters
    out of their cartons.

11> When you fake throwing the ball, he fakes being fooled.

10> "Bwawk!  Polly wanna new gold cage, or else Polly's telling
    Larry King about your rubber hose fetish and what you did
    with that watermelon.  Bwawk!"

 9> Well *someone* ordered the cat-size purple silk turban and
    crystal ball squeaky toy.

 8> You ask for your slippers.  Rover brings you Penthouse.

 7> He times his litter box usage so that total poop-smell
    permeation in your apartment occurs at EXACTLY the same
    moment your date arrives.

 6> The freakin' ferret *always* blocks your Triple-Word Score
    move.

 5> You toss your "Inauguration '93" commemorative Frisbee over
    by the sunbathing babes, and good ol' Buddy comes back with
    two bikini tops.

 4> Spot's able to guess 10 times out of 10 that it's Alpo for
    dinner.

 3> No matter where you hide the key to the liquor cabinet, by the
    time you get home from work, Fido's halfway through the peach
    Schnapps, watching "Beaches," and crying like a baby.

 2> You get the strange feeling that your cat is ignoring you on
    a whole *new* level.

                      Rumination of the Day

        If it's true that unprotected sex with someone is
         like having sex with everyone they had sex with,
           and everyone *they* had sex with, and so-on,
           then that must mean that in some roundabout
          way most of us have had sex with Kevin Bacon.

Subject:	RE: Dudes...

Hey Guys!  I just got back from traveling two weeks in China, so I am now able to answer my emails.  A friend of mine here at Enron has a brother that lives in China and he got married to a Chinese national.  So I decided to join them for the wedding and sightseeing.  The sights were pretty amazing.  Great Wall, Forbidden City, Tianamen Square, etc.  Definitely culture shock though.  I know what it feels like to be a rock star now.  I was pretty much stared at wherever I went.  I am sure they think I look like a big nosed western devil freak.  The food wasn't as bad as I thought, although I did get the trots the last two days in country.  I knew I shouldn't have eaten the mutton.  

Fortunately I missed the flood of the century, Ernie!  I heard about it the first week in China.  Wasn't much I could do from China, so I just kept my fingers crossed and fortunately the house was safe and sound when I got back.  Some jackass drove up on my front yard and left some tire tracks.  There must have been high water in the street that he was trying to avoid.  Doooh!!

Other than that everything is going fine.  Doing the old dating thing!  Boy is that a ton of laughs.  Women at this age are definitely interesting.  I spend most of my time avoiding questions like, "Where is this relationship headed?"  Uh excuse me, but we only met last week!  

Congratulations, Paul on little Chloe.  I checked out the pics on your website and the family looks great.  Bieraugel you still look the same as the last time I saw you, but  Whoa, is that a little gray hair I saw on you Paul?  Oh well, we all have chinks in our armor.  Seriously though it is a beautiful family and I know it must be tough to be away from them.  Are you going to be staying in the Navy for awhile?  10 more years and you can retire eh!

Ernie,  Sounds like things are going well at work.  Congrats on the promo.  We definitely need to do a better job of getting together here in Houston.  You need to get the wife and we need to have dinner one night or something!  The Buick sounds prime.  240HP ought to take care of it.  Sounds better than the shaka-mobile.  What the hell ever happened to that car anyway?  I still love to tell stories about that car.  You can't beat a K-mart lawn chair for comfortable automobile seating.  Ernie, I think my focus is on the 5 series BMW.  Unfortunately my stock portfolio has delayed my auto purchase for awhile.

Let's pledge to all do better at keeping in touch.  It is great to hear from you guys.  We need to plan a little get together when you get back from sea.  It has been to damn long. Take care and be safe, Bruddas.  

Gerald

You're right, we need to do better at keeping in touch.  Gerald and I live in
the same town, and we still hardly see each other!  Great to hear from you.

I know it's got to be the hardest thing to leave for six months, especially with
the new baby when mama needs you the most.  Do you guys have any family in town
at least?  You're wife is probably involved with a network of military wifes at
least.  It's hard for me to leave for even a couple of days.  The week after
next I am in Dallas for a week of training, that'll be the longest I've been
away.

Well, my wife just went to the movies with my oldest, Sophie (she's four).  I'm
home with my two boys who are both napping, so I actually have a minute to
write.  I am about to make lunch for my neighbor who is from South Africa.  His
family just left for SA for two months, so I'll probably have him over often.
We're about to cook some Elgin sausage, remmeber where that is Paul?  I was in
Austin for work on Friday (drove there) and stopped to get some.  The road trip
was quite eventful: saw a few wreck and one car was even on fire.

You probably don't catch national weather Paul, but we just had a
once-in-a-century storm here in Houston (that's what they're calling it on the
news anyway).  Some places in the Houston area had 35" of rain in the last two
days!  We had about 20" in my area, no flooding though.  Gerald, how did you
fare?  So we've been declares a natural disaster area and all of that.


Other than that, not a whole lot going on.  Work is going well:  I got promoted
in Feb and am in line for another in August, so I can't complain - Frito-Lay is
a good stable company that treats it's employees well.  Let's see what else?
just got a new car that I am excited about.  I had a little Ford Focus 5spd for
my comuter car, but got tired of all of the shifting in traffic on the Beltway.
So I found a 1999 Buick Regal GSE with only 22k on it, in immaculate shape.  I
know, a Buick sounds kinda lame, but as far as Buicks go, this the only one I
would own.  It has leather, sunrfoor, sporty wheels, killer 220-watt stereo,
with a 240HP supercharged engine with room for 5 to boot!  I loaded up the
family and cargo to go to the Valley during Memorial Day, it even got 28 MPG!
Beats the hell out of the 14 or so in the Suburban, with gas prices these days.
Gerald, are you still in the market for a SUV?   I think you were interested in
the Toyota Sequoia or the Acura MDX?  You'd better just stick with the 5-series
Bimmer, I know I would if I were in your shoes!

OK, guys, gotta get to cookin those sausages.  Bieraugel, hang in the there out
at sea and keep us proud!

Subject:  Dudes...

Ernie and Gerald, well dudes, we're doing just what we said we were not
going to do.  Fall out of touch again.  Here is the latest.  I am out on my
ship for six months now.  We left June 4th and we get back in November.
It's a bitch to be gone from the family for that long but it very busy so it
goes fast for me.  We had our fourth (and probably last) kid on May 13th.
Her name is Chloe Elizabeth.  She is perfect.  My two year old (Kate) was
very surprised when we brought her home.  Carson said he wanted a brother
and Kelly wants to hold her all the time.  You can check some pictures out
at www.geocities.com/pbieraugel.  Take it easy you guys and stay in touch.
Paul.

As we all know, Blanchard was a GDI his first semester at LSU.  While living in Power dorm, Blanchard once overheard one of the Pi PHi for boys that he was hanging out with say "Hey, Dude, Sorority girls are hot!"  Blanchard, being from Paincourteville and not being what we would call a 'master' of the English language, though that this 'fresh' Pi Phi meant "All greek girls are good in bed."  So what did Blanchard do.  He went out and found the first GREEK girl he could, and he started dating her.  After many pleasant years, (some of which I will not mention for Tim's sake, and mine)  Tim and his Greek Goddess are engaged.  Yes, that's right.  Tim took Lenhart's advice (because we all know that Lenhart is the authority on relationships with the opposite sex; I mean, who wouldn't take his advice) and Tim decided to start his life sentence with a lovely girl who has bunch of friends who all give it up like it was going out o! f style.  
 
Tim's wedding is on THE DAY OF THE MISSISSIPPI STATE GAME.  For those of you who are not Tiger fans (which seems to be most of you these days), that is Oct. 20th.  I know, it is an away game, which is better than having a wedding on a home game.  But some of us who are fans like to go to the out of town games.  True story, here.  I went to a wedding with Louise and her mother on Friday night.  You have not lived until you take two dates to a wedding, one of whom is engaged to your good friend and the other whom cannot speak the language.  Anyway, after the wedding that we attended, Louise's mom asked me if I would prefer Tim's wedding ceremony be in either half English and half Greek, or all in Greek.  I responded "I do not care.  I will be listening to the LSU game on my headphones anyway."  I know what some of you are saying, it is only one game.  Yes, and I am sure that was the only weekend they could hav! e it since so many of us from New Orleans have been to a wedding at the Greek Cultural Center, because all of us from New Orleans have been to numerous weddings / goat roasts there.  Anyway, it is a done deal, and we are all happy for the couple.
 
The real point of this e-mail is to organize Tim's bachelor party.  We have it planned for the weekend of September 22 (what a novel idea!!!  Plan a wedding event on a weekend where there is neither an LSU event, nor Jazz Fest!!!)  We are planning to go to Vegas.  As per our current plans, we would leave on that Thursday (the 20th, I think) and return on Sunday.  'Paw Paw' Blanchard heard that in September, his game of choice really starts hitting, that of course would be the nickel slots.  'Paw Paw' already has his Panama Jack hat, his         "Geaux Dinar-deaux" T-shirt, his jams, and his black socks with brown leather sandals packed and ready.  His fanny pack is stuffed with Twinkies and silver dimes.  He is really fired up about the $1.99 shrimp cocktail (early bird special, of course.)
The plans are to get there Thursday night (Nicky, get more drink tickets.)  Thursday night we can get settled, possibly gamble a bit.  On Friday, maybe play golf (although I will probably be too drunk / hung over / missing for an early tee time.)  On Friday night, we can go "clubbin'", as I am sure The Tricky Texas Trio (Lenhart, Landry, and Mitch) will want to do.  On Saturday, Tim wants to wake up early, get the sports section of the Advocate, drink coffee, and bitch about the Tigers.  Instead, we are going to watch and bet on College Football all day.
Saturday night, Tim wants to go see Sigfried and Roy.  However, we are not doing that.  If he wants to see gay men play with caged tigers, he can find out the next time Nesbitt tries out for the LSU cheerleading team.  Instead, either SaturDay or Friday night, myself and a select group (yet to be determined, but including Lenhart if he is not doing his best Ricky Martin impression at Club C2K) will go on a recon mission to the Deja Vu.  Therefore, on Saturday night, we will have entertainment in the room that some of us have seen before, and who know what is expected of them (that way Lenhart will not make the entertainment  cry when he asks them to fuck his Elway blow-up doll).  Remember Tim.  If you use a strap on, it is not considered cheating.  I am a future lawyer.  I should know.
This weekend is September 22.  There is no excuse for you to come up with when you have this much notice.  Out of money?  Bullshit.  Save up until then.  Have to work?  Bullshit.  Take a vacation day.  Actually, September will be the first month that I will be gainfully employed.  But, I know that my boss, the Honorable G.Thomas Porteous, will let me off for one day if debauchery will be had, although I may have to put a few hundreds on black for him periodically throughout the weekend.
For those of you who will be recently married, I already have an excuse for you.  "Honey, Tim came to all OUR wedding functions.  The least I can do is return the favor."
For those of you that will be married shortly after Tim, I also have an excuse. "Baby / Schmoopy / I wish your tits were as big as Mindy/, if want other people to come to our wedding functions, then I have to attend theirs."  For all of you single guys, no excuse.
Please respond to this e-mail at your earliest convenience, or I will see ya'll this weekend.  All plans are subject to change.  (Chad, if you want to send an e-mail to only me, hit 'Reply to sender.'  If you hit 'Reply to all'. it sends the message to all of the RECEPIENTS of the original message.  I know that you said Law School was such a stupid idea compared to Business School, but I think you could learn from some of our lessons, such as it is better to remain silent and be thought of as a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt.)
 
Hope this e-mail finds you doing well.

Subject:	RE: Dudes...

Hey Guys!  I just got back from traveling two weeks in China, so I am now able to answer my emails.  A friend of mine here at Enron has a brother that lives in China and he got married to a Chinese national.  So I decided to join them for the wedding and sightseeing.  The sights were pretty amazing.  Great Wall, Forbidden City, Tianamen Square, etc.  Definitely culture shock though.  I know what it feels like to be a rock star now.  I was pretty much stared at wherever I went.  I am sure they think I look like a big nosed western devil freak.  The food wasn't as bad as I thought, although I did get the trots the last two days in country.  I knew I shouldn't have eaten the mutton.  

Fortunately I missed the flood of the century, Ernie!  I heard about it the first week in China.  Wasn't much I could do from China, so I just kept my fingers crossed and fortunately the house was safe and sound when I got back.  Some jackass drove up on my front yard and left some tire tracks.  There must have been high water in the street that he was trying to avoid.  Doooh!!

Other than that everything is going fine.  Doing the old dating thing!  Boy is that a ton of laughs.  Women at this age are definitely interesting.  I spend most of my time avoiding questions like, "Where is this relationship headed?"  Uh excuse me, but we only met last week!  

Congratulations, Paul on little Chloe.  I checked out the pics on your website and the family looks great.  Bieraugel you still look the same as the last time I saw you, but  Whoa, is that a little gray hair I saw on you Paul?  Oh well, we all have chinks in our armor.  Seriously though it is a beautiful family and I know it must be tough to be away from them.  Are you going to be staying in the Navy for awhile?  10 more years and you can retire eh!

Ernie,  Sounds like things are going well at work.  Congrats on the promo.  We definitely need to do a better job of getting together here in Houston.  You need to get the wife and we need to have dinner one night or something!  The Buick sounds prime.  240HP ought to take care of it.  Sounds better than the shaka-mobile.  What the hell ever happened to that car anyway?  I still love to tell stories about that car.  You can't beat a K-mart lawn chair for comfortable automobile seating.  Ernie, I think my focus is on the 5 series BMW.  Unfortunately my stock portfolio has delayed my auto purchase for awhile.

Let's pledge to all do better at keeping in touch.  It is great to hear from you guys.  We need to plan a little get together when you get back from sea.  It has been to damn long. Take care and be safe, Bruddas.  

Gerald

You're right, we need to do better at keeping in touch.  Gerald and I live in
the same town, and we still hardly see each other!  Great to hear from you.

I know it's got to be the hardest thing to leave for six months, especially with
the new baby when mama needs you the most.  Do you guys have any family in town
at least?  You're wife is probably involved with a network of military wifes at
least.  It's hard for me to leave for even a couple of days.  The week after
next I am in Dallas for a week of training, that'll be the longest I've been
away.

Well, my wife just went to the movies with my oldest, Sophie (she's four).  I'm
home with my two boys who are both napping, so I actually have a minute to
write.  I am about to make lunch for my neighbor who is from South Africa.  His
family just left for SA for two months, so I'll probably have him over often.
We're about to cook some Elgin sausage, remmeber where that is Paul?  I was in
Austin for work on Friday (drove there) and stopped to get some.  The road trip
was quite eventful: saw a few wreck and one car was even on fire.

You probably don't catch national weather Paul, but we just had a
once-in-a-century storm here in Houston (that's what they're calling it on the
news anyway).  Some places in the Houston area had 35" of rain in the last two
days!  We had about 20" in my area, no flooding though.  Gerald, how did you
fare?  So we've been declares a natural disaster area and all of that.


Other than that, not a whole lot going on.  Work is going well:  I got promoted
in Feb and am in line for another in August, so I can't complain - Frito-Lay is
a good stable company that treats it's employees well.  Let's see what else?
just got a new car that I am excited about.  I had a little Ford Focus 5spd for
my comuter car, but got tired of all of the shifting in traffic on the Beltway.
So I found a 1999 Buick Regal GSE with only 22k on it, in immaculate shape.  I
know, a Buick sounds kinda lame, but as far as Buicks go, this the only one I
would own.  It has leather, sunrfoor, sporty wheels, killer 220-watt stereo,
with a 240HP supercharged engine with room for 5 to boot!  I loaded up the
family and cargo to go to the Valley during Memorial Day, it even got 28 MPG!
Beats the hell out of the 14 or so in the Suburban, with gas prices these days.
Gerald, are you still in the market for a SUV?   I think you were interested in
the Toyota Sequoia or the Acura MDX?  You'd better just stick with the 5-series
Bimmer, I know I would if I were in your shoes!

OK, guys, gotta get to cookin those sausages.  Bieraugel, hang in the there out
at sea and keep us proud!

Ernie and Gerald, well dudes, we're doing just what we said we were not
going to do.  Fall out of touch again.  Here is the latest.  I am out on my
ship for six months now.  We left June 4th and we get back in November.
It's a bitch to be gone from the family for that long but it very busy so it
goes fast for me.  We had our fourth (and probably last) kid on May 13th.
Her name is Chloe Elizabeth.  She is perfect.  My two year old (Kate) was
very surprised when we brought her home.  Carson said he wanted a brother
and Kelly wants to hold her all the time.  You can check some pictures out
at www.geocities.com/pbieraugel.  Take it easy you guys and stay in touch.
Paul.

Dear Ernesto ,

Welcome to the pleasure of planning an event for your asshole friends.
This has been a long standing tradition that the person that gets sucked
or suckered
into planning an outing for the group gets bitched at non stop until the
event happens.
The next step is "the event" that will be the turning point of this
bitching.
There are two outcomes,
1.      Everyone has a good time and you will bitch back and it will be
lessened to good friendly humor
2.      Everyone is pissed b/c they drove 100 miles , they play bad and
blame you for picking a bad place to
        play, they kill you and bury you in a sand trap on the number 12
hole , finish the round and never mention
        your name again.

All I have to say Ernie is good luck on everyone play GOLF well this
Sunday.

Live the next few days to the fullest , they might be your last.

Long live Ernesto

Dutch

long live ernie! long live ernie! ernie for mayor!  i agree with
everything except the fact that i think we would bury you earlier
on, probably at the turn at hole number 10 (especially if there
isn't any brock-dog-like sausages available at the course).  i
think it will be great, and don't forget that no one ever had any
problems driving to willis to play golf at texas national before.
quit your whinning and play golf, in my case i'll just hack at

Subject:	RE: Dudes...

Hey Guys!  I just got back from traveling two weeks in China, so I am now able to answer my emails.  A friend of mine here at Enron has a brother that lives in China and he got married to a Chinese national.  So I decided to join them for the wedding and sightseeing.  The sights were pretty amazing.  Great Wall, Forbidden City, Tianamen Square, etc.  Definitely culture shock though.  I know what it feels like to be a rock star now.  I was pretty much stared at wherever I went.  I am sure they think I look like a big nosed western devil freak.  The food wasn't as bad as I thought, although I did get the trots the last two days in country.  I knew I shouldn't have eaten the mutton.  

Fortunately I missed the flood of the century, Ernie!  I heard about it the first week in China.  Wasn't much I could do from China, so I just kept my fingers crossed and fortunately the house was safe and sound when I got back.  Some jackass drove up on my front yard and left some tire tracks.  There must have been high water in the street that he was trying to avoid.  Doooh!!

Other than that everything is going fine.  Doing the old dating thing!  Boy is that a ton of laughs.  Women at this age are definitely interesting.  I spend most of my time avoiding questions like, "Where is this relationship headed?"  Uh excuse me, but we only met last week!  

Congratulations, Paul on little Chloe.  I checked out the pics on your website and the family looks great.  Bieraugel you still look the same as the last time I saw you, but  Whoa, is that a little gray hair I saw on you Paul?  Oh well, we all have chinks in our armor.  Seriously though it is a beautiful family and I know it must be tough to be away from them.  Are you going to be staying in the Navy for awhile?  10 more years and you can retire eh!

Ernie,  Sounds like things are going well at work.  Congrats on the promo.  We definitely need to do a better job of getting together here in Houston.  You need to get the wife and we need to have dinner one night or something!  The Buick sounds prime.  240HP ought to take care of it.  Sounds better than the shaka-mobile.  What the hell ever happened to that car anyway?  I still love to tell stories about that car.  You can't beat a K-mart lawn chair for comfortable automobile seating.  Ernie, I think my focus is on the 5 series BMW.  Unfortunately my stock portfolio has delayed my auto purchase for awhile.

Let's pledge to all do better at keeping in touch.  It is great to hear from you guys.  We need to plan a little get together when you get back from sea.  It has been to damn long. Take care and be safe, Bruddas.  

Gerald

You're right, we need to do better at keeping in touch.  Gerald and I live in
the same town, and we still hardly see each other!  Great to hear from you.

I know it's got to be the hardest thing to leave for six months, especially with
the new baby when mama needs you the most.  Do you guys have any family in town
at least?  You're wife is probably involved with a network of military wifes at
least.  It's hard for me to leave for even a couple of days.  The week after
next I am in Dallas for a week of training, that'll be the longest I've been
away.

Well, my wife just went to the movies with my oldest, Sophie (she's four).  I'm
home with my two boys who are both napping, so I actually have a minute to
write.  I am about to make lunch for my neighbor who is from South Africa.  His
family just left for SA for two months, so I'll probably have him over often.
We're about to cook some Elgin sausage, remmeber where that is Paul?  I was in
Austin for work on Friday (drove there) and stopped to get some.  The road trip
was quite eventful: saw a few wreck and one car was even on fire.

You probably don't catch national weather Paul, but we just had a
once-in-a-century storm here in Houston (that's what they're calling it on the
news anyway).  Some places in the Houston area had 35" of rain in the last two
days!  We had about 20" in my area, no flooding though.  Gerald, how did you
fare?  So we've been declares a natural disaster area and all of that.


Other than that, not a whole lot going on.  Work is going well:  I got promoted
in Feb and am in line for another in August, so I can't complain - Frito-Lay is
a good stable company that treats it's employees well.  Let's see what else?
just got a new car that I am excited about.  I had a little Ford Focus 5spd for
my comuter car, but got tired of all of the shifting in traffic on the Beltway.
So I found a 1999 Buick Regal GSE with only 22k on it, in immaculate shape.  I
know, a Buick sounds kinda lame, but as far as Buicks go, this the only one I
would own.  It has leather, sunrfoor, sporty wheels, killer 220-watt stereo,
with a 240HP supercharged engine with room for 5 to boot!  I loaded up the
family and cargo to go to the Valley during Memorial Day, it even got 28 MPG!
Beats the hell out of the 14 or so in the Suburban, with gas prices these days.
Gerald, are you still in the market for a SUV?   I think you were interested in
the Toyota Sequoia or the Acura MDX?  You'd better just stick with the 5-series
Bimmer, I know I would if I were in your shoes!

OK, guys, gotta get to cookin those sausages.  Bieraugel, hang in the there out
at sea and keep us proud!

Ernie and Gerald, well dudes, we're doing just what we said we were not
going to do.  Fall out of touch again.  Here is the latest.  I am out on my
ship for six months now.  We left June 4th and we get back in November.
It's a bitch to be gone from the family for that long but it very busy so it
goes fast for me.  We had our fourth (and probably last) kid on May 13th.
Her name is Chloe Elizabeth.  She is perfect.  My two year old (Kate) was
very surprised when we brought her home.  Carson said he wanted a brother
and Kelly wants to hold her all the time.  You can check some pictures out
at www.geocities.com/pbieraugel.  Take it easy you guys and stay in touch.
Paul.

 God Finally Gives Shout-Out Back To All His Niggaz <http://graphics.theonion.com/pics_3731/head_god_gives_shout-out.gif>


      SOUTH BRONX, NY-The Lord Almighty finally responded to nearly two decades of praise in hip-hop album liner notes Monday, when He gave a shout-out back to all His loyal niggaz.

 	   <http://graphics.theonion.com/pics_3731/god_gives_shout_out.jpg>	
Above: Rappers Method Man and Redman give big ups to God (inset). 	

      "Right about now, I want to send a shout-out to each and every nigga who's shown Me love through the years," said the Lord, His booming voice descending from Heaven. "I got mad love for each and every one of you niggaz. Y'all real niggaz out there, you know who you are. Y'all was there for me, and it's about time I'm-a give some love back to God's true crew."

      "All y'all niggaz, y'all be My niggaz," the Lord added.

      As of press time, God has thanked nearly 7,000 of His niggaz, including those in New York's Bad Boy and Ruff Ryders posses, the No Limit soldiers and Cash Money Millionaires holdin' it down in New Orleans, Nelly and the whole St. Lunatics crew, Busta and the rest of the Flipmode Squad, His peeps from back in the day, and all the real ruffneck niggaz in lockdown. He also sent shout-outs to everybody in the Old School, as well as to Lil' Bow Wow and all the other new niggaz just coming up.

      "Mad props to P. Diddy, Jay-Z, DMX, Lil' Kim, Mystikal, Eve, Ja Rule, Jadakiss, Trick Daddy, and Xzibit. And one love to Meth, RZA, GZA, Ghostface, and the rest of My real niggaz in the Wu-Tang Clan," the deity said. "These My beloved niggaz, with whom I be well-pleased."

      Now nearing the 48-hour mark, the Lord's first-ever reciprocal shout-out shows little sign of slowing down. Based on estimates of the number of rappers who have thanked Him in liner notes over the past 20 years, hip-hop experts say the historic shout-out is likely to continue through early next week.

      In addition to rap's current stars, God offered shout-outs to the original hip-hop heads, including such pioneers of the art form as Grandmaster Flash, Busy Bee, Melle Mel, Jazzy Jay, Kool Moe Dee, Afrika Bambaataa, DJ Red Alert, the Cold Crush Brothers, Fab 5 Freddy, Kurtis Blow, Kool Herc, and the Funky 4+1.

      God also offered shout-outs to the many DJs, record labels, magazines, TV shows, and radio stations that have tirelessly supported hip-hop over the years. Among them are Def Jam, Tommy Boy, Jive, Roc-A-Fella, Rap Pages, The Source, Right On!, The Box, Funkmaster Flex, Ed Lover and Dr. Dre, WBLS 107.5, KISS-FM, and Hot 97.

      "For supporting the many artists who have supported Me so faithfully, I say thank you," God said. "All praise to Devante Harrell, Wanda Simmons, LaShell Thomas, and everybody else at Uptown/MCA for making this possible."

  <http://graphics.theonion.com/pics_3731/god_gives_shout_out_jump.jpg>	 	
Above: A pair of shout-out tablets handed down by the Lord. 	

      As a further sign of His love for the hip-hop community, God assured the nation's rappers that He is taking good care of all their peers currently with Him in heaven.

      "Tupac, Notorious B.I.G., Eazy-E, Scott LaRock-some of y'all niggaz are already up in this bitch," the Lord said. "For those of you who were left behind, know that the Lord has got your dead homies' backs. Faith [Evans], I promise I'm taking real good care of your Biggie. He resting in crazy peace, no doubt."

      Thus far, God has not played favorites, thanking such fallen-off acts as Hammer and Vanilla Ice in the same breath as vital artists whose careers are still going strong. The Lord has also seen fit to thank the little-known likes of Baby Tragic, DJ Phreek Malik, and Da Ill Collector-MCs so obscure that virtually no one within the hip-hop community has heard of them. All rappers, God explained, are equal in His sight, and none are too small to escape His notice.

      "God sees even the smallest sparrow fall," said Dr. Cornell West, Harvard University professor of African-American studies and philosophy of religion. "The same is true of MCs: Whether a major superstar or a complete unknown, all rappers are His children, and He loves them all."

      The sheer volume of names notwithstanding, the nation's rappers are deeply touched by God's gesture of tribute and appreciation, with many stating that they "feelin' Him."

      "God is the Original," Brooklyn-based rapper Mos Def said. "The world is ruled by the wealthy and the wicked, but all respect due to the Creator who made this world and who will one day bring justice to the wicked and righteous alike."

      Despite the overwhelmingly positive response among rappers, the Lord is drawing fire in certain circles for His use of the word "nigga." On Monday's Larry King Live, conservative activist Rev. Calvin Butts, a longtime ally of the Lord, blasted Him for His "shocking, unexpected use of the racially loaded N-word." Some concerned parties, including decency crusader C. Delores Tucker, Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT), and members of the San Francisco-based What About The Children? Foundation, are calling for a boycott of church services until God issues an apology.

      Reacting to the controversy, many in the hip-hop community are rushing to the Lord's defense.

      "The word 'nigga' means different things depending on how it's used and who's saying it," rap legend and Public Enemy frontman Chuck D said. "Judging from context, God obviously wasn't being derogatory. He was using 'nigga' as a blanket term of affection for all His true supporters on the rap scene. At one point, He said, 'I wanna give a shout-out to Ad-Rock, MC Serch, and my man Dan The Automator-all y'all is real niggaz in My all-benevolent sight.' Considering the fact that Ad-Rock and Serch are Jewish, and the Automator is Asian-American, it's clear God isn't talking about race here. He's just paying respect to all those who have paid respect to Him."

      "God's the ultimate playa, so naturally He's going to have some haters," rapper Ice Cube said. "But these haters need to realize that if you mess with the man upstairs, you will get your ass smote. True dat."

I just feel that things have gotten so bad that maybe it's in part a
reaction on your part that you don't think I'm committed, and that hurts,
too.  After last nite's discussion with your parents, that's all that I
could surmise.

I announced to my Corporation that I wouldn't be accepting a promotion
because I'm committed to you.  Yet there's no recognition of that
whatsoever.  But even with that commitment, I don't think we're ready, at
least not right now; but I've been working toward the time when we are
ready.  But lately it just seems to have deteriorated to a horrible state.
And I'm tired of your Mother making it seem "perverse" that we're not
married, and I don't need to have her continue repeating it.

I am also very tired of your Mother's insinuations---and less than
insinuations.  I can talk very comfortably and rationally with your Dad and
I value those discussions.  But your Mother's constant implications that
your some big victim and I'm a very big asshole has worn very thin and it's
inappropriate and rude.  It's particularly troublesome coming from someone
with a less than untarnished relationship history.  As you know, I don't
react well to dogmatism and preaching.  Your Dad takes a very different
tack.

Jeff, I'm sorry my parents did that last night.  I will ask them not to do
that again.  And I am not upset about us not getting married or moving in
together.  I would like for our relationship to evolve and grow into
something like that.  All I was saying is that we have a communication
problem if you think we've talked about it and I don't think we have.  If I
ever thought you wanted me to move in with you, I would have done it.  That
has nothing to do with selling my house.  But I'm not upset about it
either.
You seem to be putting a lot of words in my mouth in this email about what
I
want that I'm not telling you about and none of it is true.

But most importantly, I was NOT calling you a liar or an asshole.  When I
said honest, I was talking about being straightforward and communicating in
a way that doesn't make me have to guess what you're really saying.  It had
nothing to do with lying and I never accused you of lying.  I hope you
understand that.  And I certainly never EVER called you an asshole last
night.  Jeff, I really don't think this has to be an argument.  But it's
very sad to me that you don't think we care enough about each other to be
committed to this relationship.  That's a pretty serious blow.

Prentice:
I'm happy to talk.  However, if you're unhappy because 1) I haven't asked
you to marry me, or 2) I haven't asked you to move in together, or 3) I
haven't asked you to have children, then you need to say so.  I'm very
upset to think that the only time I hear what you feel, or what your mother
believes you feel, or what your father believes you feel, is when we're
having dinner with your parents and they impose their limited view of our
relationship on the situation.  I'm not interested in debating my personal
relationship with you with your parents as a substitute for our
communicating---that's not a relationship.  Nor am I interested in living
my life according to what your parents or my parents or anyone else's
parents wish they'd done.  If I had ever had someone call you the way
Cameron called me on Saturday night, you would have screamed at me for
days.  Yet, when it's the other way, there's always a difference, always a
reason.  It seems like rather than communicate we are continually engaged
in a rhetorical exercise.  It 's very upsetting, and it's the sort of
one-way street that has me so deeply depressed about how we interact.

If you feel that I'm dishonest, or too dominant or not committed to the
relationship, then you need to say so---I shouldn't have to hear it in
vague terms from your parents over dinner.  And if you want to move in
together, or get married, or have children, then perhaps it would be
constructive for you to say so, and offer ways in which we would make that
happen.  From my perspective, all you've ever considered is 1) not selling
your house---for a variety of reasons that I don't understand or 2) buying
another place with Cameron.  But I'm not dating you and your sister, I'm
dating you.  So it seems to me that if you were committed to it, you would
search a solution.  Instead, it seems to me, none of those things occur,
but I'm an asshole for not having moved in with you, or married you or had
children with you.  That's lose-lose and everyone can call me an asshole,
but it won't change things.

It seems to me that two things have to happen for people to make a
commitment.  First, they have to care for each other, and the way we
interact, it's hard to say objectively that we pass that hurdle.  You have
frequently asked your parents to stop arguing, that it upsets you too much,
but that's what we spend most of our time doing.  Second, each person has
to be emotionally mature enough to undertake the responsibilities that come
with the commitment.  I've always wanted to be your partner, not your older
brother, and not your father.  I want an equal partnership where both
individuals are pouring into the relationship, even when it's difficult,
even when it's inconvenient.   If you're looking for a different dynamic in
a relationship, then we need to get it clear.  I don't think we pass these
two hurdles and so I don't think we're quite ready for the commitment,
though I've been working hard at trying to get there, and think we could.
But if we're not ready, I'm not going to do it to please your parents or my
parents or anyone else.

We can talk all day long about what an asshole I am, but I'm not willing to
do that anymore.  And if that's a requirement, then I will fail and we
shouldn't waste our time.  It takes two, pure and simple.  I'm very sorry
that work is overwhelming right now and that I go to school and am in the
process of fulfilling something I've always wanted to do--have property on
the coast.  If you feel that we can't have the relationship you want or
need because of my schedule, then you need to tell me.

If you want to talk about these issues, that's great, but I just feel that
"you never said this,"  and "no, this is what I said," and all the spinning
and debating is a diversion that doesn't get to the real issues.   I was
very upset that after the conversation we had with your parents, which I am
very unhappy about, you call to me I lied  about something.  After this
long, if you want to discuss my dishonesty, then I think we need to take a
hard look at why we're in this at all.  So I'm happy to talk, but not on
the phone, and not about who's the bigger asshole, or who's a lying
son-of-a-bitch.

Hi Folks,

If you're like me, (and I know many of you are) this game can take on a life
and death seriousness.   The topsy turvy season may be good for Neilson
Ratings but not so good for your blood pressure.   Sometimes, the best thing
to do is laugh a little.   With that said, I'm forwarding a column I found
entertaining from one of our favorite Sportswriters, Bill Simmons of
ESPN.com

I do this every so often.   And I always get a bunch of email yelling about
"I didn't sign up for this" and to "keep it serious and on Football".   Save
your breath.   Unsubscribe instructions are at the bottom of this email.

Let's jump to Mr. Simmons.   You can find the original article here

Lighten Up,

Joe


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Whazzup with the NFL?

By Bill Simmons, ESPN.com

With apologies to CNNSI's Peter King, here are 10 things I think I think
after six weeks of the NFL season:


1. I think this has been the strangest NFL season in recent memory. The
media usually starts their "This has been the strangest season ever!" buzz
around Week 5 or Week 6 -- it's an NFL October Tradition, right up there
with my girlfriend asking on Sunday at noon if I want to go apple-picking,
me following that question up with the answer, "What are you, insane?" and
her storming out of the house -- but this season really has been the
strangest season of all-time.

Consider the following things:

Twenty of the 31 NFL teams have records of .500 or better.

The short list of quality teams this season includes Chicago, San Diego and
San Francisco (combined record last season: 12-36).

Out of the nine consensus Super Bowl "contenders" from the preseason, only
three of them (Green Bay, St. Louis and Philadelphia) have winning records.
The other six (Indy, Tampa, Baltimore, Tennessee, Denver and the Giants) are
a combined 15-18.

After the favorites went 35-21 against the spread in the first four weeks,
the underdogs went 22-4-2 over the next two weeks. (22-4-2! That's
impossible!)

The Patriots are slightly above-average as a football team, maybe even a
little better when you factor in their coaching staff and team chemistry ...
and there isn't an NFL team they couldn't beat if they played well and get
two or three breaks. No 2001 victory is out of their grasp. Seriously. And
just for the record, I feel the same way about the Browns and Falcons.

Along those same lines, other than St. Louis, there isn't a reliable
favorite in the league anymore. Remember the days when you could count on a
contender to bounce back from an embarrassing defeat the following week?
(What happened to Denver and Baltimore last week? Didn't they get the memo?)
Remember the days when you could throw two quality home teams into a
two-team tease and assume they would cover at home (like Tampa, New Orleans
and Indianapolis, for instance)? Remember the days when the home team was
money on Monday nights (like this week with the Giants)? I miss those days.
And so does my wallet.

So what's left? I'm not sure. We already achieved Pete Rozelle's vision of a
parity-driven NFL two seasons ago, when the 200-to-1 underdog Rams cruised
to a Super Bowl title. Now we've reached a point where the league has become
predictably unpredictable. It's a gambler's worst nightmare.

(Which reminds me...)


2. I think the local weatherman in hell will report "Temperatures in the
midteens all weekend" before I wager on a team that prominently features Jon
Kitna again.

2a. I think that there's excruciating, there's really excruciating ... and
then there's the experience of watching Carolina's Chris Weinke throwing two
interceptions inside the 10-yard-line in the first half against a brutal
Redskins team, then singlehandedly giving the 'Skins life with 10 minutes
remaining in a 14-0 game (by tossing a screen pass right to LaVar Arrington
for a 67-yard interception and touchdown). Can everyone who wagered on the
Panthers last Sunday file a class-action suit against Weinke? Has this ever
been done before?

2b. I think the lesson here, as always, is "Never wager on a team with a
crappy QB." And I knew this! I knew this. Normally I'd fine myself, but the
financial bloodbath has already been devastating enough. Does anyone know a
good pawn shop in the Boston area?

(Whoops... I'm using my out-loud voice again...)

2c. I think I miss the days when you could recoup your 1 p.m. gambling
losses by wagering on two sturdy 4 p.m. teams in "Message Game" situations.
For instance, Sunday featured Denver coming off an embarrassing loss in
Seattle (and heading into San Diego for an AFC West tilt), as well as the
Packers looking to drive a stake in Minnesota's season and extend their lead
in the NFC Central. In the old days, you could rely on the Mike Shanahans
and Brett Favres of the world to save your butt. Not anymore.

As I told my buddy J-Bug last night, "This has become a league which I am
unfamiliar with." All of the gambling rules accrued over the years ... you
might as well throw them out the window. I give up.


3. I think I always get excited for those Coors Light commercials with Barry
Sanders for one reason: Sanders possesses the strangest hairline of anyone
on the planet. And just for the record, that includes Shane Battier, Roy
Firestone, Elton John and Brad Daugherty.

(Note: Somebody needs to release the Barry Sanders Wig for Halloween this
month, along with the Dave Campo Wig, the Troy Aikman Concussion Mask, the
Dave Wannstedt Fake Mustache, the Al Groh Blow-Up Doll and the Fred Taylor
"Pull Your Own Groin" Start-Up Kit. I'm telling you, NFL Collectibles should
have a whole Halloween Department. It's a no-brainer. They could even
release an "NFL Legends," collection so we could finally get our hands on
the Bruce Coslet Wig. Can somebody make this happen, please?)


4. I think it took 16 frustrating years, but Doug Flutie finally found the
right NFL team. It's funny how life works out -- had the Bills decided to
keep him over Rob Johnson, Flutie would have spent his twilight years on a
rebuilding team. Instead, he's the proverbial "Right Guy, Right Place, Right
Time," on a team where he doesn't have to carry the offensive load -- unless
it's absolutely necessary (like Sunday, when Denver stacked the line against
the sublime LaDainian Tomlinson, putting the game in Flutie's hands).

4a. I think Tampa Bay made an enormous mistake going for Brad Johnson over
Flutie ... and I think it probably costs Tony Dungy his job within the next
one to four months.

4b. I think it's fair to say that the list of "Reliable Quarterbacks Who Can
Consistently Win Games" has been whittled down to four: Brett Favre, Kurt
Warner, Jeff Garcia and Flutie. That's it. That's the list.

Think about it. Daunte Culpepper and Donovan McNabb make too many mistakes.
Brian Griese, Rich Gannon and Mark Brunell are only as good as the people
around them. Peyton Manning is slapping together a Karl Malone-type career
(and his Ewing Theory potential is jumping off the charts). Steve McNair and
Chris Chandler can't stay healthy. Drew Bledsoe has been hideously exposed
by Tom Brady (more on this in a second).

Look at the list again: Favre, Warner, Flutie and Garcia. Three of those
four guys were forced to prove themselves in other professional leagues
before another NFL team even gave them a chance.

(I ask you again ... is this a weird NFL season or what?)


5. I think we've reached the section of the "10 Things" column where I'm
supposed to talk about non-sports items, like high school field hockey and
Starbucks.

(Racking my brain ...)

(All right ...)

I'm ashamed to admit this, but Monday night I went to see the new Drew
Barrymore movie "Riding in Cars with Boys," accompanying the Sports Gal as p
art of our "She won't bitch about the fact that I spend seven hours every
Sunday watching football if I escort her to an occasional chick flick and
don't bitch about it" deal. Savvy, huh?

I only have two hopes with chick flicks: that they're short and that there's
a cute actress prominently involved. Needless to say, since "Riding in Cars"
lasted for 140 interminable minutes and the wheels came off the "Drew
Barrymore is a babe" bandwagon about three years ago, I spent the last 45
minutes trying to pull a piece of metal off the bottom of my seat so I could
jam it into my jugular vein. Even the Sports Gal didn't like the movie that
much, and this is coming from a person who was peeved that the Academy Award
committee snubbed "The Wedding Planner" last spring.

Five disturbing phenomenons about the chick flick:

Every chick flick has a scene where either A) a male baby pees on somebody,
B) there's a wedding, and/or C) there's an unredeeming male character who
lets somebody down. This is apparently a rule. If you can work all three of
those scenes in the same movie, the director apparently gets a $50,000
bonus.

Whenever I see a chick flick, there's always a moment when I accidentally
make eye contact with another boyfriend or spouse at the theater and we
quickly glance away. It's like seeing somebody in the adult section of a
video store -- you're just hoping nobody will recognize you and things will
move along as quickly as possible.

I'll sum up the storyline from every chick flick: "Men suck."

There's always a specific threesome sitting somewhere in the theater during
every chick flick -- one girl sitting between two guys. Why two? I have no
idea. Usually, they seem like platonic friends, the girl isn't very
attractive, at least one of the guys looks like Tim Burton, and the guys
overlaugh at every joke in the movie, to the point that you start rooting
for one of them to choke to death on a Sour Patch Kid. Again, I'm not sure
what's going on here.

Every time you block out the fact that you're watching a chick flick,
something funny happens and everyone in the theater starts laughing, a
high-pitched cacophony of giggles that reminds you, "Hey, I'm at a chick
flick." That's usually when I start bludgeoning myself over the head with my
128-ounce Mountain Dew.

Anyway, on a scale of 1 to 10, I'd give "Riding Cars with Boys" a minus-13.
Let's forget this section ever happened ... and if you're attending any
showings of "Serendipity" in the Boston area over the next few weeks and see
someone who looks like me, please don't make eye contact with that person.
For everyone's sake.


6. I think the Tom Brady Era is taking the Ewing Theory to the next level,
especially considering that your buddy Sports Guy predicted a
Ewing-resurgence for the Patriots before Week 3. You had the overhyped,
overvalued superstar who never really won anything and received an
inordinate amount of media attention and fan hype (Drew Bledsoe). You had
the requisite injury during the season that caused everyone to write the
team off (Bledsoe going down in Week 2, possibly for the season). You had
everyone writing the team off.

And then ...

You had the team immediately running off a 3-1 streak, including two "I
can't believe this is happening!" wins (both over Indy), as well as an
improbable comeback win (over San Diego), showing more life than they've
shown in years. Now you have the local media searching for answers to
explain how a team can lose its franchise player and "inexplicably" start
playing better. And everyone keeps saying that the Patriots have come out of
nowhere. You know better.

Just for the record, I officially abandoned my seat on the Bledsoe Bandwagon
at 2:30 on Sunday afternoon, when the Pats took a 28-6 lead in Indianapolis,
and I called my father just to pretend I was Paul Tagliabue, announcing,
"With the first pick of the 2002 expansion draft, the Houston Texans select
... Drew Bledsoe, quarterback, New England Patriots."

(Sounds far-fetched? Remember, they signed Bledsoe to a mammoth contract
extension last spring; they couldn't trade him without absorbing an
impossible salary cap hit. But according to NFL rules, any player who gets
selected in the expansion draft has his contract and cap figure transferred
to the Texans -- even the pro-rated bonus payments -- which means the Pats
could leave Bledsoe unprotected and hope the Texans gobble him up, which
would clear $10 million to $12 million in cap space to spend in free agents
next spring. Mmmmmm ... cap space ...)


7. I think Tampa Bay and Indianapolis should trade coaches -- Dungy
straight-up for Jim Mora. Why don't teams ever trade coaches in sports?
What's the worst thing that could happen? What about Marty Schottenheimer
and two Schottenheimers to be named later for George Seifert and cash?
Couldn't this work or am I crazy?


8. I think Buffalo's Travis Henry always looks like one of those stubborn
buffaloes on the Discovery Channel that fight off four or five cheetahs
before they finally get dragged down. Last week against the Jaguars, he had
57 carries for 65 yards even though he was hit three yards behind the line
by four defenders on every carry. High comedy. His career might not last
until November at this rate.


9. I think Chicago and Pittsburgh are shaping up as the "Out of Nowhere
Teams" in each conference this season -- those basement teams that beef up
against crappy opponents, shock the experts, win 10-11 games and scare the
heck out of the bookmakers in Vegas (given that they were long shots to win
it all before the season). Both teams run the ball effectively, avoid taking
chances on offense, swarm the ball on defense and make plays on special
teams; in other words, they're following Baltimore's 2000 playbook to a tee.

Chicago's resurgence wasn't that improbable, given that somebody strange was
coming out of the NFC Central ... but Pittsburgh? Did you ever envision them
at 4-1, when four of their first five were on the road? Now they finish up
with seven of their last 11 at home. Yikes. It's almost enough to make you
forget that Kordell Stewart's still involved. Almost.

Keep in mind, just in case the Bears or Steelers stumble over the next few
weeks, there are an inordinate amount of other "Out of Nowhere" candidates:
San Fran (4-1), San Diego (4-2), Cleveland (4-2), Atlanta (3-3) and New
England (3-3). For all we know, all of those teams might make the playoffs
this season ... but the schedule seems to favor Chicago and Pittsburgh over
everyone else. For all we know, all of those teams might sneak into the
playoffs. It's been that kind of season.

10. I think that "Any Given Sunday" was a flawed movie, to say the least,
crippled by brutal editing, suicidal casting decisions and a script that
meandered all over the place. And yet one scene makes it all worth it. You
know the one. It's the scene when Al Pacino (as coach Tony DeMarco) throws
the movie on his back before the Big Game:

"You know, when you get old in life, things get taken from you. That's part
of life. But you only learn that when you start losing stuff. You find out
that life's a game of inches. So is football. Because in either game, life
or football, the margin for error is so small. I mean, one half a step too
late, or too early, and you don't quite make it. One half-second too slow or
too fast, you don't quite catch it. The inches we need are everywhere around
us. They're in every break of the game, every minute, every second."

(Now the players are clapping ...)

"On this team, we fight for that inch. On this team, we tear ourselves and
everyone around us for that inch. We claw with our fingernails for that
inch. Because we know that when we add up all those inches, we know that's
gonna make the #$%#@& difference between winning and losing! Between living?and dying!"??(Now the players are screaming along with every word...)??"I'll tell you this -- in any fight, it's the guy who's willing to die who's?gonna win that inch ... Now I can't make you do it. You gotta look at the?guy next to ya, look into his eyes, and I think you're gonna see a guy who?will go that inch with you."??(The light bulb finally clicks for enigmatic QB Willie Beamon ... he strolls?toward his coach, inspired ...)??"You're gonna see a guy who will sacrifice himself for this team because he?knows when it comes down to it, you're gonna do the same for him. That's a?team, gentleman. And either we heal, now, as a team ... or we will die as?individuals. That's football, guys. That's all it is."??(Dramatic pause)??"Now, what are you gonna do?"??(Complete Pandemonium in the locker room. Chills galore. And the team bursts?out of the locker room in slow motion ...)??And I can't think of a better way to end this column.???/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/???Back to "Serious Stuff" now...??Joe??/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/??Bryant Analytics, Inc.

A preview of next season's MNF call:


--------------------
AL MICHAELS: Hello and welcome to another edition of ABC's Monday Night
Football, tonight broadcasting from beautiful Fed Ex Field in
Washington,
D.C. I'm Al Michaels, and joining me in the booth are two new members of
the ABC family, Dennis Miller and Dan Fouts.

DENNIS MILLER: Wow, Monday Night Football. I don't want to appear
nervous,
but I'm under more strain right now than Linda Tripp's capri pants. I
have
to tell you, I'm conflicted about this. I usually like to be the
outsider,
the rabble-rouser, the iconoclast, but I also like a nice seat at a
sporting
event.
And this seat is as nice as they get - except I think I took one of
Boomer's
old squeak toys up the *** when I sat down.
DAN FOUTS: I was a quarterback.
MILLER: Thanks for that insight, Mr. Peabody. Dan Fouts, everyone. I'm
looking over here, and he's giving me that same blank stare I see when I
put
my dog on the phone. Hey, this isn't the Senior Tour, Chi Chi. Try to
keep
up.
MICHAELS: Tonight the New England Patriots will try to get started on
the
right foot after a disappointing 8-8 showing last season. They take on
the
Washington Redskins, whose owner, Daniel Snyder, has paid out $65
million
in
free agent salaries and bonus payments in the offseason and is looking
for
results.
MILLER: Snyder is throwing around cash like a screech monkey playing
with
a
pop-up Kleenex dispenser. But he's a real hard-*** - it must be great to
coach this team. Norv Turner comes to work every day, hands his balls to
Gus, the 80-year-old equipment guy, who puts them in a footlocker behind
the
Stairmaster until the end of the game. Did you catch that one ***
-chewing
Turner received last season? Lee Harvey Oswald got off easier in that
little
room at the Dallas P.D. And when Turner finally got out of there you
could
tell he was looking around, desperately praying for Jack Ruby to show up
and
end his ****ing misery.
MICHAELS: The teams are on the field, and we're almost set for the
kickoff.
FOUTS: I was the quarterback. I didn't go on the field for the kickoff.
MILLER: Jesus, Shaggy, saunter on back to the Mystery Machine and take a
breather, OK? Why don't you pick up your brain off that pile of papers
it's
holding down and see what happens when you plug it in? The game's
starting,
and I feel like Corporal Agarn trying to explain supply and demand to
the
****ing Hakowis.
MICHAELS: As always, the Fuji Blimp makes its annual appearance at
Monday
Night Football. Glad to have you back, gentlemen.
MILLER: It is balloooooooooon! (high-pitched cackle).
MICHAELS: Starting at quarterback for the Redskins will be Jeff George,
whom
I guess one could call a journeyman at this point in his career.
MILLER: I have to admit, when I saw George on the roster I thought he
had
as
much chance of making the team as Linda Hunt on the set of Baywatch.
This
guy's been around - he's called a lot of plays under a lot of centers.
He's seen more giant asses than a guest chair on the Jerry Springer
Show.
MICHAELS: Snyder spent plenty in the offseason to sign star players such
as
Deion Sanders and Darrell Green on defense.
MILLER: Yeah, but look at that Fantasia broom army of social misfits the
Redskins call an offensive line. I have a feeling that George's
appearance
tonight is going to be shorter than Mini-Me stooping over to pick up one
of
Dr. Evil's monocles.
MICHAELS: George drops back to pass, moves out of the pocket and finds
the
veteran Michael Westbrook, who is tackled after an 11-yard gain.
MILLER: Look, I'm new, I don't know that much about defensive schemes.
But
it seems to me right there that the middle was as vacant as an interview
with Posh Spice.
FOUTS: I was in a Miller beer commercial, and your last name is Miller.
MILLER: Hey, Aristotle, save some of the probing insight for the rest of
us,
OK? How come I'm getting the funny feeling that this is an episode of
The
Munsters, and I'm Marian, the normal one? Now, I don't want to get off
on
a
rant here, but the useful comments coming from your side of the booth
could
be counted on the one hand of a bad wood shop teacher. I can still see
the
jelly on your forehead where the electroshock terminals were attached.
When
I took this job, they didn't tell me that I would be teamed with Pepe
the
Human Hamster on one side, and on the other a broken-down ex-quarterback
who
makes Jethro Bodine look like David Niven. I want to find the psychotic
network programmers who thought up this train wreck and point out that
this
**** has to be harder to watch than a sausage being made.
FOUTS: I like sausage.
MILLER: Ah **** it, where's my propeller hat?
MICHAELS: The handoff is to Stephen Davis, who is tackled at the 39-yard
line by defensive tackle Henry Thomas. But there's a flag on the play.
MILLER: I'd have to say that was the poorest result since O.J. took the
lie-detector test. And look at that ref, will ya? He's got more nervous
tics
than a Belfast valet.
MICHAELS: That play will be brought back, making it first and 20 from
the
49-yard line.
MILLER: Hey, who took my Raisinettes? Damn you, Roone Arledge! Damn you
to
hell!
MICHAELS: George back to pass ... and the throw to Westbrook falls
incomplete. Ty Law covering on the play.
MILLER: I don't want to be a downer here, but how about throwin' the
freakin' ball to the other side of the field, you know, cha-cha? You've
got
Westbrook drawing a bigger crowd than Anna Kournikova at the
maximum-security lockdown at Rikers, while meanwhile the kid on the
other
side is lonelier than a hooker at a Star Trek convention.
MICHAELS: To be fair, there have only been four plays so far.
MILLER: Come on Al, you missing link. That receiver is being shunned
like an Amish kid with a nipple ring. The left side of the field is to
George as a shower is to the French. You've got a better shot at hearing
Charlie
Sheen give the keynote address at a Promise Keepers rally than you do of
ever -
MICHAELS: Sorry to break in on you, Dennis, but Washington is guilty of
a
false start, and that will set them back another five yards.
MILLER: The ref is whipping out that flag like it's the only lighter at
a
crack house.
Later that evening:
MICHAELS: So your final score is Washington 17, New England 10. We're
headed
off to San Francisco for our next Monday night broadcast, hope to see
you
there.
MILLER: I may be late; I don't fly. It'll be me in my Chevy Nova playing
Mad
Max with the Madden Cruiser all the way down Route 66, and you'll know
I'm
winning when Pavorotti starts hurling six-legged turkeys out the
skylight
for ballast.
MICHAELS: What will you be doing with your remaining time in Washington,
D.C.?
FOUTS: Doing a little sightseeing.
MILLER: I'll be back at the hotel, masturbating like a red-assed monkey
watching the Banana Channel.
MICHAELS: So from all of us here at Monday Night Football, see you next
week...

guy's been around - he's called a lot of plays under a lot of centers.
He's seen more giant asses than a guest chair on the Jerry Springer
Show.
MICHAELS: Snyder spent plenty in the offseason to sign star players such
as
Deion Sanders and Darrell Green on defense.
MILLER: Yeah, but look at that Fantasia broom army of social misfits the
Redskins call an offensive line. I have a feeling that George's
appearance
tonight is going to be shorter than Mini-Me stooping over to pick up one
of
Dr. Evil's monocles.
MICHAELS: George drops back to pass, moves out of the pocket and finds
the
veteran Michael Westbrook, who is tackled after an 11-yard gain.
MILLER: Look, I'm new, I don't know that much about defensive schemes.
But
it seems to me right there that the middle was as vacant as an interview
with Posh Spice.
FOUTS: I was in a Miller beer commercial, and your last name is Miller.
MILLER: Hey, Aristotle, save some of the probing insight for the rest of
us,
OK? How come I'm getting the funny feeling that this is an episode of
The
Munsters, and I'm Marian, the normal one? Now, I don't want to get off
on
a
rant here, but the useful comments coming from your side of the booth
could
be counted on the one hand of a bad wood shop teacher. I can still see
the
jelly on your forehead where the electroshock terminals were attached.
When
I took this job, they didn't tell me that I would be teamed with Pepe
the
Human Hamster on one side, and on the other a broken-down ex-quarterback
who
makes Jethro Bodine look like David Niven. I want to find the psychotic
network programmers who thought up this train wreck and point out that
this
**** has to be harder to watch than a sausage being made.
FOUTS: I like sausage.
MILLER: Ah **** it, where's my propeller hat?
MICHAELS: The handoff is to Stephen Davis, who is tackled at the 39-yard
line by defensive tackle Henry Thomas. But there's a flag on the play.
MILLER: I'd have to say that was the poorest result since O.J. took the
lie-detector test. And look at that ref, will ya? He's got more nervous
tics
than a Belfast valet.
MICHAELS: That play will be brought back, making it first and 20 from
the
49-yard line.
MILLER: Hey, who took my Raisinettes? Damn you, Roone Arledge! Damn you
to
hell!
MICHAELS: George back to pass ... and the throw to Westbrook falls
incomplete. Ty Law covering on the play.
MILLER: I don't want to be a downer here, but how about throwin' the
freakin' ball to the other side of the field, you know, cha-cha? You've
got
Westbrook drawing a bigger crowd than Anna Kournikova at the
maximum-security lockdown at Rikers, while meanwhile the kid on the
other
side is lonelier than a hooker at a Star Trek convention.
MICHAELS: To be fair, there have only been four plays so far.
MILLER: Come on Al, you missing link. That receiver is being shunned
like an Amish kid with a nipple ring. The left side of the field is to
George as a shower is to the French. You've got a better shot at hearing
Charlie
Sheen give the keynote address at a Promise Keepers rally than you do of
ever -
MICHAELS: Sorry to break in on you, Dennis, but Washington is guilty of
a
false start, and that will set them back another five yards.
MILLER: The ref is whipping out that flag like it's the only lighter at
a
crack house.
Later that evening:
MICHAELS: So your final score is Washington 17, New England 10. We're
headed
off to San Francisco for our next Monday night broadcast, hope to see
you
there.
MILLER: I may be late; I don't fly. It'll be me in my Chevy Nova playing
Mad
Max with the Madden Cruiser all the way down Route 66, and you'll know
I'm
winning when Pavorotti starts hurling six-legged turkeys out the
skylight
for ballast.
MICHAELS: What will you be doing with your remaining time in Washington,
D.C.?
FOUTS: Doing a little sightseeing.
MILLER: I'll be back at the hotel, masturbating like a red-assed monkey
watching the Banana Channel.
MICHAELS: So from all of us here at Monday Night Football, see you next
week...

The joy of going to college in Texas....
UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS I live in a town where you stand out if you don't have a
purple Mohawk, facial piercing chained to nipple piercing, a homosexual
lover, or hang out at the Magnolia Cafe. More people go to my school than
live in Australia. I honestly believe that Ricky Williams is a god. I am
open-minded and spiritually in tune - except towards people who are
closed-minded and spiritually out of tune. You can see my dorm from Chicago
for it is as tall as Florida would be if it stood up. I protest everything
-except protests. I am a gold card carrying member of Amnesty International.
I am openly bi-curious. I am a Longhorn.

TEXAS A&M UNIVERSITY I live in a town the size of a piece of
bacteria on a fly's ass. I spend Friday nights practicing my yells. 
I can whoop better than anyone can in my battalion. I beat up faggots for
fun. If
I'm not yelling, drinking with my battalion, or beating up faggots 
for fun, I am at the Dixie Chicken. My father went to school here, just as
his father
did before him, and his father before him. My brother went to tu. They never
found his body after he came home that first Christmas in college. I won't
walk on the grass. I look forward to the day I, too, will do the elephant
walk. I believe it is cool to do something because they tell me it is
tradition. If something is not a tradition and we accidentally do it, we
then make it one. I can call UT "tu" if I want. I am an Aggie. BAYLOR
UNIVERSITY I live by homeless vagrants, whom I turn my
nose up I look just like everyone else at my school. The NoZe Brothers are
the coolest things since khakis and sandals. I have an Abercrombie and Fitch
everything. I can co-ordinate outfits and ensembles better than anyone in my
upscale apartment complex. I have radar that lets me know where the closest
ATM is. If I can't find one it's okay. I have ten credit cards all of which
to my parents. My town is so conservative that anyone who kisses on the
mouth
before three years of marriage is drug through the town. I like me. I should
be an underwear model. I am a Bear.

TEXAS TECH UNIVERSITY I live on a piece of dirt so flat that we call the
four degree incline at the intersection of 19th and Brownfield the big hill.
I get dirt in my eyes, hair, and teeth when I walk to class. I can out drink
anyone from any other school because that is what we do. If I'm not drunk by
4:30pm, I'm high. I can't buy beer within 50 miles of where I>live - so I
trek to the strip, which my friends and I
all consider a true paradise on Earth. I don't go to many football games. I
don't go to any organizational meetings. I don't really go to anything. Not
even class. I like the fact that Will Rogers' horse's ass points to College
Station. I fry cow balls. I know where Buddy Holly used to live. I am
desperately trying to find a rival within our conference to make fun of. Our
football players get caught by the NCAA. If I'm not drunk by 4:30pm, I'm
high. But I'm usually drunk by 4:30pm. Or I'm high. I am 
a Red Raider.

THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH TEXAS (UNT) I am either a film geek or a musician.
If I am neither then you will find me hanging out on Fry Street dressed in
my punk garb. I think my school sucks yet I still attend school here. I wear
t-shirts and hats from either A&M or UT because I wish I could've gotten in
there. On Thursdays you will find me shaking my thang at the Groovey Mule or
down in Deep Ellum. I think Denton is the scuzziest town ever and I bitch
about all the pot holes in the roads when I am driving anywhere in the city.
Most of the people here are weird. Noone
stays on the weekends. Noone has ever even heard of my school. On Sundays,
the whole town goes to church at Denton Bible. Damn, I really wish I
could've gotten into one of the other Texas colleges. I am a mean green
Eagle. Cawwww!
TEXAS CHRISTIAN UNIVERSITY (TCU) I am in a frat or sorority of course. I
drive a Lexus or Mercedes, and if I pass all my classes then Daddy said he
would buy me that little condo on Hulen next semester. I wear my diamonds
and heels for football games and get dressed for bed and  THEN go to the
basketball games. Anyone and everyone goes to the Pub or Scooners, or to
Longhorns and dance with old Mexican cowboys. We are having a J.Crew built
in the bookstore next year and our send home credit cards apply at ALL times
and locations. Where the girls' hair is as fake as their tans. The freshman
15 means nothing more to me than a new wardrobe. Where the girl to guy ratio
is four to one and the only one getting any action is the rapist. Where the
girls are girls, and so are the guys. I'm a Frog.

SOUTHERN METHODIST UNIVERSITY (SMU) See the listing for Texas Christian
University above...change 'Hulen' to 'Mockingbird'. I'm aMustang.

SFA STATE UNIVERSITY I am drunk or having sex right now. I went to class
once. That about sums it up. I am a Lumberjack.

THE UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON I work all day or all night. I attend school
part-time. I'm trying to get a degree, any degree, to help get a decent job.
I live with my parents, and spend as little time on campus as possible.
Football games?? You mean we have a football team??? When say my school is
in an urban setting, I'm serious. In the shadows of the fourth largest city
in the U.S., right in one of the most crime-ridden areas I go to school. I
wish I could go to A&M, or any other big school and get a real degree. I
wish I hadn't flunked out when I was attending a real
school. I'm a Cougar.

SOUTHWEST TEXAS STATE UNIVERSITY (SWT) I tried to get into a real school,
but couldn't. I spend most weekends tubing down the river in New Braunsfels
drunk and/or high and naked, or getting drunk and acting stupid. I'm a
Bobcat.

SAM HOUSTON STATE UNIVERSITY (SHSU) I am a big time band nerd.
My favorite hobby is playing with my instrument. There are no attractive
people at my school because we're all band geeks. At night, my flute is my
best friend. I'm studying music so that I can become a licensed band geek
leader and warp the minds of future generations. What the hell is a Bearkat,
anyway?

TARLETON STATE UNIVERSITY I am a roper ("kicker"). My life revolves around
bovines and sheep, and I like studying "animal husbandry", if you know what
I mean. I either wear Wranglers that cut the circulation off to my unit, or
Rockies that give me a major camel toe. I have a belt buckle the size of a
dinner plate. My favorite beer is Coors Lite. I have a gun rack in the back
of my pickup, which is a diesel with dual wheels. I am a Texan.

EAST TEXAS STATE Who cares? Does anybody go there? Isn't that
like a community college?

Heinifer,

A few corrections:  Jeff and Cathy call each other "boo" not "pooh".  
Secondly, with your threats of my arse being kicked, I must say that violence 
solves nothing, but if you wanna dance tonight, bring it on.  Third, it is 
not a "supposed" conference call just because you didn't plan it or have the 
idea, IT IS A GO!  Fourthly, & oh yes Fourthly is a word, anyone who wants to 
can "present"  their ideas & suggestions  (or demands if your a Nazi) on the 
conference call.

Lastly, 
I can't wait to get drunk in a foreign country with all of you.

It'll be too cold and I'll complain about being cold the whole time. Plus,
it's not as interesting as Spain. Matt, you could wear cute little
bullfighter pants, with knee-high white socks and a sexy beret atop your
noggin. The hot-blooded, salsa-dancin', dark skinned, beautiful spanish
maidens will be falling all over you. You don't want frompy, belching,
stinky armpit German women chasing you around, do you? Or, do you?

Eric, to your little Illinois/Nazis comment below that you didn't copy me
on, well...You suck! And you'll pay later for that, dear.

What's the problem with Germans?  I tend to like them . . . very strong
and verile people.  A handsome people.  Plus, they love to drink beer.
AND, I would like to wear some of those little shorts that have
suspenders attached with cute little buttons and dance a little jig with
a big stein in my hand.  What is wrong with that?

A LONG DAY

THE DAILY RECKONING

LONDON, ENGLAND

WEDNESDAY, 6 JUNE 2001

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

*** No inflation...no worries. Stocks up again. Will the
Dow hit a new high? Maybe. Crazier things have happened.

*** And wouldn't Mr. Bear be delighted! All those
suckers...I mean, investors...with their picnic backets.

*** Productivity, sales, debt, juice, Trotskyites...and the
usual stuff!


* * * * * * * * * Advertisement * * * * * * * * * * *

Dragon-sized Profits in China - 75% in less than two weeks!

Get first-hand investor intelligence from an experienced
speculator and core profits of 75%, 700%, even 4,000%.
You'll join an exclusive circle of investors who are
alerted to spectacular opportunities within 15 minutes of
their discovery. To find out how you can cash in on three
"special situation" bargains poised for mind-boggling
profits, click here:

http://www.agora-inc.com/reports/CASE/WinBig/

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

*** Long bonds, gold, and the gap between inflation indexed
bonds and regular 10-year treasury notes all are down -
apparently confirming Mr. Greenspan's observation that
inflation is no problem.

*** No inflation, No worries. Or so investors seemed to be
saying yesterday, as they rushed in to buy stocks. The Dow
Jones Industrial Average powered ahead 114 points and the
NASDAQ jumped 78 points, or 3.6%.

*** Among the winners on the day were stocks that have been
big losers all year. Names like Lucent, Cypress
Semiconductor and Xilinx topped the leader-and in board.
Xilinx, the specialty semiconductor chipmaker, cheered
investors by reporting that its rapidly deteriorating
profitability is deteriorating less rapidly. The stock rose
10%.

*** Meanwhile, back in Reality Land, the NAPM's services
index fell once again in May and April factory orders
plunged 3%.

*** What kind of miracle economy is this? "The productivity
of U.S. workers logged its sharpest fall in eight years ."
declares a Reuters report, "while signs of wage pressure
emerged with the largest gain in labor costs in more than a
decade."

*** Productivity of workers outside the farm sector fell at
an annual rate of 1.2 percent during the first three months
of the year. Unit labor costs, meanwhile, shot up at a 6.3%
annual.

*** This month's issue of Red Herring offers "66 Experts
Predict When The Economy Will Recovery." The experts are
sure it won't take long - overwhelmingly expecting recovery
with 9 months. But wait..what's this...they've got Mary
Meeker, the dot.com shill, and, oh my God, Ira Magaziner,
Hillary Clinton's health care sidekick, included as
'experts."

*** And for now, no amount of bad news seems to dim
investor optimism. After all, the stock market is "looking
ahead," or so we are told. Is it looking ahead like a 4-
year-old looks ahead to his birthday party? Or rather, like
the driver in a careening racecar looks ahead to a brick
wall?

*** "The bulls' numbers are growing, bolstered by a feeling
that the economy may be bottoming out after a marked
slowdown," the Journal story stated. "All told, investors
in April put $21 billion into stock mutual funds, after net
withdrawals of $20.6 billion in March, according to Lipper
Inc. Inflows continue in May."

*** The latest investor sentiment indicators confirm the
ebullient mood. ISI's survey of institutional investors
finds that they are more bullish than they have been at any
time in the last five years.

*** The Chicago Board Options Exchange produces a nifty
index known as the "VIX" that tracks option pricing to
gauge the mood of investors. And the VIX currently signals
the highest level of bullishness since last August. The
current VIX reading is close to the extreme levels reached
immediately before previous market peaks like that of July
1998 and March of last year.

*** In May, Wall Street brought out more than $49 billion
in new stocks [offerings].the most since October 2000.

*** Charles Biderman, editor of Liquidity Trim Tabs sees
the record issuance of new stocks and bonds as a negative
for the stock market - the thinking being that the more
investors buy these new issues, the less they buy the
stocks that are already trading. And if folks don't buy
existing stocks because they are busy buying new ones, the
stock market will have a tough time gaining ground.

Eric Fry

And more notes.

*** Clickety clack, clickety clack. The Eurostar doesn't
really make much in the way of noise. In fact, it's quiet
on the 7:15 to London. Not like 18 months ago - when
business were passing each other investment tips and loudly
yucking it up over how much money they were making.

*** I picked up a copy of The Times... The English papers,
I'm happy to report, don't pretend to the same high-minded
seriousness as their American counterparts. Instead, in the
first few pages we find stories murder, mayhem, jealous
lovers and tearful tales of tiny tots drowned in backyard
pools. My favorite is a report of two men who worked as
counselors for sex offenders at a prison. They became so
discomfited that they sued the Prison Service and were
awarded more than half a million dollar in damages for the
"psychological horrors" they suffered.

*** In a Paris newspaper, Liberation, I am promised a
shocking revelation from Lionel Jospin's past. I imagine
pedophilia..necromania.Republican tendencies...instead I
discover that the Prime Minister was once a member of
Trotskyite wing of the loony left. Weren't nearly all
France's soft socialists - when they were younger, of
course - connected to more radical factions?

*** And here, dear reader, I feel the need to make a full
disclosure - lest it come out later whilst I am in the
middle of a presidential campaign or running hard for the
post of master-at-arms at some looney, futile right wing
romance. I, too, once attended a meeting of the Trotskyite
Revolutionary Workers League..or was it the Revolutionary
Trotskyite Proletarian Alliance?.

*** I remember it well. I was student at the time; I
thought it would be a good place to meet girls.. The
clandestine meeting - held in what appeared to be a school
auditorium - was chock-a-block with gabby intellectuals and
a very few genuine 'workers.' The building had no smoke
alarm system, of that I was sure, so thick was the pall of
smoke from gauloise cigarettes. Beyond that, there were
endless tiresome speeches.and then everyone rose, raised
his right fist and joined in singing the "International" -
the theme song of the group. I decided then and there that
I wanted nothing more to do with a group that sang that
badly and had so few good looking women...

*** This may be a good summer to visit Europe - while the
dollar is still strong. (I realize that I gave this same
advice last summer. The euro has not risen, but it has not
fallen either...so the bargains remain.)

*** "If you're looking for a castle somewhere," Forbes
quotes Sotheby's head of International Realty, "and don't
want to spend a lot of money," look to the Loire Valley.
You can "still find a little chateau - yes, a chateau - for
about $500,000," gushes Forbes. On the second point, Forbes
is right. You can buy a chateau for $500,000. But like so
much information, it is dangerously misleading. Once you
have paid for your chateau, your expenses are just
beginning.

*** In fact, If you want to see for yourself, both the joys
and pitfalls of owning a chateau in France, you may want to
join one of the groups that is coming to stay in my money
pit this summer. International Living is bringing a group
on June 24th. Follow this link...

["A Long Day" was written during a visit to the Normandy
Beaches in April of last year. Today is the 57th anniversary
of D-Day.]

A LONG DAY

I thought of the famous painting by Norman Rockwell. A
deeply furrowed and weathered farmer from out on the plains
sits on the runner of his pickup truck, while his son
awaits the train. The son is going off to college and is
full of the bright expectations of youth. The father is
more concerned with how he will get the next crop in
without his son's help. The picture appeared to be from the
late `30s.

There, in section D of the American cemetery, on the bluff
overlooking the English Channel, was the simple cross that
marked the grave of Nils Wennberg, private first class,
from South Dakota. Is that what happened to the boy, I
wondered.

The 6th and 7th of June, 1944, were black days for the
Nindel family of Indiana. The crosses at Omaha Beach record
that two Nindel boys, Preston and Robert, died within 24
hours of each other on those two days - two of the nearly
10,000 American casualties.

Also of interest was the grave of Jimmie Montcrieth - whose
heroism on the 6th of June was so remarkable that he was
awarded a Medal of Honor - posthumously. Montcrieth ran
from position to position, exposing himself to enemy fire,
rallying his troops and managing somehow to advance against
the German bunkers. He was killed - but the bunkers were
taken.

"All I remember," said Stanley, a stout oysterman and
carpenter, and D-Day veteran, whom I worked with back in
the `60s, "was jumping in the water and running up to the
beach. I had never been shot at before. I didn't care for
it. Guys were getting shot all around me. And I has so much
sh...[gear] hanging off me, I could barely move. But I made
it to the beach and crouched behind the dunes and started
shooting back. I didn't know what I was shooting at. But I
hoped to hell I hit some son of a bitch in a German
uniform."

"Stanley," I once asked during the terminal phase of the
Vietnam War...when the draft lottery numbers were being
handed out, "couldn't you have gotten out of it? Didn't you
have polio or something?" Stanley had had polio as a child
and walked with a limp.

"Hell no. I didn't tell them about the polio. Besides I
didn't want to be sitting around here with my thumbs up my
[bleep] while everybody else was getting their [themselves]
shot up. Of course, it was different back then...."

I walked along the beach where Stanley must have come
ashore. I tried to imagine what it was like. The German's
reinforced concrete bunkers are still there. They still
look massive, impregnable and unassailable. How could
anyone have gotten to safety across the open beach and up
the sandy bluff? And yet, they did. By the end of the day
on June 6, there were 150,000 troops on the continent. As
Hitler remarked, "The God of War has gone over to the other
side."

The God of War had indeed changed allegiance. Rommel, in
charge of the German defense west of the Seine, committed
suicide. His successor, Kluge, followed in his footsteps -
shooting himself a few months later.

Less obedient to the God of War was von Choltitz, in charge
of the German garrison in Paris. Hitler ordered him to
destroy the city. But von Choltitz may have been in Paris
too long. He disobeyed orders. He surrendered Paris,
intact.

The American cemetery at Omaha Beach is the setting of the
first and last scenes of "Saving Private Ryan." As in the
film, there were a number of WWII vets wandering among the
crosses and stars of David. Like the father in the Rockwell
painting, they wore baseball caps - often with indicators
of their military affiliations - and bore the creases of
age and hardship. Accompanied by younger relatives, they
walked slowly, reverentially.

Most were very friendly and open - relaxed, as Americans
tend to be. One older guy seemed to be stunned, though. It
was as though he was trying so hard to recall something,
that he had forgotten where he was and what he was doing.

I wondered what they were thinking...and what memories they
brought with them. And how things could have changed so
much...so that even though these events happened during
their lifetimes - it is as if they happened a thousand
years ago.

I thought, too, about how all the great changes and
challenges of our century were over before I was born. The
baby boomers have faced nothing like the Depression, or
Electrication, or Automobilization, or National Socialism,
or WWII. We have had an easy time of it. Let's hope it
stays that way.

Your very humble correspondent,

Bill Bonner
