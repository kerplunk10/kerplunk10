Hi
Just wanted to let you all know that Mike mailed some pictures of
Cameron to you guys yesterday.  Cooper--- I think you're mom told me
that you moved recently within your building.  I realized this this
morning and it probably went to your first apartment so you might be on
the lookout for yours.  Christie -- i think i only sent one wallet for
you, just let me know if you want another one for Mike, as I have plenty
left.   Anyway, i hope you all enjoy the additional pictures for your
"Cameron shrine" :)

take care,
Camille

PS--- Mike & I went to the driving range yesterday and I actually
enjoyed it!  Gripping a golf club is a strange sensation (to say the
least).  I actually hit the ball more times than I missed.  My left hand
was a little sore this morning.  My next email to everyone will be from
the LPGA tour (haha)

ha-ha (ha-ha) noun

   Sunk fence.

[From French haha, reduplicative of ha!, exclamation of surprise, that might
come out when tripped by such an obstacle.]

   "They covet our haha fences, tucked out of view by ditches and so named
   because of their surprise value."
   Tina Kelley, Zoo Nice To See You: Woodland Park Basks In Spotlight,
   The Seattle Post-Intelligencer, Sep 19, 1995.

Instead of explaining in a thousand words what a ha-ha looks like,
I'll show you a picture: http://www.yale.edu/yup/images/bormann3.jpg
Etymologists claim we got the word ha-ha from ha!, the sound one might
exclaim on getting tripped by that trap, otherwise known as a sunken
fence.  I'm sure they have done their research and are right. But I
can't help thinking it might have been derived from the laughter of
a French aristocrat when an unsuspecting guest tripped while visiting
his chateau.

Ah-ha, that gives me an idea, just in time for this April Fool's Day!
I think I'll call a landscape designer.

"Hi, Mr. Dougwell? I'd like to order a ha-ha around my apartment."
"You'd like to order what?"
"Ha-ha! You think you can do it by next week? I've some visitors coming
 over. And don't forget to bring your Hard Hat and Hack Hammer."

All kidding aside, what's the brouhaha about this thing? In the 18th
century someone came up with the clever idea of a fence that let the
property owner have an unhindered view of the landscape, giving an
illusion of contiguous land, while protecting him from trespass. Here's
a fascinating essay on the deeper meanings of ha-ha:
http://bsc.edu/~jtatter/borders.html

Well, this week's words may give you an impression that I'm playing an
April Fool's prank on you, but that's not true. All words featured this
week, as in any week, are "real" dictionary words.              -Anu

Enron's Lay could get $80M from deal 
Lay's employment agreement with Enron, which is set to expire Dec. 31, 2005, allows the executive to terminate his employment with the company 60 days prior to the Dynegy merger and receive a lump-sum payment of up to $80.8 million, according to a regulatory filing Tuesday.
According to the terms of the employment contract, if Lay quits before a change of control at the company, he is entitled to a lump sum payment equal to the number of years left in his contract multiplied by $20.2 million.
The agreement also allots an amount to Lay for any tax-related penalties if the lump-sum payment is held to constitute an "excess parachute payment," according to the Securities and Exchange Commission filing.
Lay's original employment agreement with Enron was amended in August when he became CEO after Jeff Skilling resigned.
Enron's shares fell 4 cents to $9.20 in recent trading.

Do you want to make a wager on the Horn's record this year?

I am proposing that we will not lose more than two games this year (regular and bowl).

Subject:	1st Draft New Risk Management Policy

OK, here's the working draft "masterpiece" (haha).   Please review and provide comments and feedback by the end of the week (note: Ted and David, we have a conference call scheduled Wednesday for the three of us to discuss).   Also, I'm sending to Price Waterhouse Coopers for their input as well - I need to spend more time reviewing what they sent on Friday to see if I've missed any issues we want to address.

I have not reviewed the details or the (one-RAC) structure with any of the other RAC or risk management functions - please do not distribute yourselves as I'd like to "cushion" the reception. 

Review meetings with these functions begins tomorrow (Tuesday), when I meet with:
?	Dave Gorte,
?	Bill Bradford and Molly Harris
?	Sally Beck's group (Beth Apollo and James New)
?	Treasury (Perkins and later, Despain)
?	Internal Audit (Kilchrist)
?	Legal (Sayre/Taylor)

I'll wait to hear from David/Ted tomorrow morning as to whether I should provide a complete draft to any of these other functions or to Rick Buy at this point, or if I should wait until later in the week when we've all had the opportunity to review.  

As I turn around the next draft, I'll work on a power point presentation for use in the executive meetings beginning the last week of June (Business Unit Offices of the Chairman, Whalley, Causey, Fastow, Skilling).  I made a quick summary of changes in the document attached below; going forward I will refine this and perhaps red-line the current policy to assist our detailed review.  


Thanks for your help,

Cassandra.

Enron's Lay could get $80M from deal 
Lay's employment agreement with Enron, which is set to expire Dec. 31, 2005, allows the executive to terminate his employment with the company 60 days prior to the Dynegy merger and receive a lump-sum payment of up to $80.8 million, according to a regulatory filing Tuesday.
According to the terms of the employment contract, if Lay quits before a change of control at the company, he is entitled to a lump sum payment equal to the number of years left in his contract multiplied by $20.2 million.
The agreement also allots an amount to Lay for any tax-related penalties if the lump-sum payment is held to constitute an "excess parachute payment," according to the Securities and Exchange Commission filing.
Lay's original employment agreement with Enron was amended in August when he became CEO after Jeff Skilling resigned.
Enron's shares fell 4 cents to $9.20 in recent trading.

     For our New York workshop, I would like to put some "meat" on my very
intellectual (HaHa) discussion of the Cover Sheet.  Specifically, I would
like to go through some examples of how the Cover Sheet can be filled out,
i.e., focus on some credit hypotheticals and provide examples of the type
of things that you can add to the Cover Sheet, i.e., arbitration, choice of
venue, waiver of jury trial, language regarding transactions performed in
the WSPP or ERCOT control areas, etc.

     If you have already drafted any provisions to add to the Cover Sheet
or have any ideas for hypotheticals, I'd appreciate your input.  If you are
planning on adding standard provisions to all your EEI Cover Sheets, this
would be an excellent opportunity to allow me to "market" them for you and
explain their need/purpose/applicability.

     Also, I don't suppose anyone has come up with a Gas Schedule to the
EEI Agreement???  Just an idea which I'm not opposed to and which would
lead us in the direction Mark and Chris seemed to be pointing, i.e., a
Master Physical Agreement applicable to numerous types commodities.
Considering GISB is intending to revise its current form for short term
transactions and create a new form for long term transactions, this would
be an excellent opportunity to allow GISB and EEI to work with (and not
against) each other.

     If you, or your company, is not currently on the drafting committee
for GISB's proposed revisions and creation of a new form for long term
transactions (which, by the way, is an important point I want to make to
the GISB group that we do not want two separate forms, one for short and
one for long in the first place), I encourage you to contact GISB @
GISB1@aol.com and get involved.

     Please let me know your thoughts.

     Thanks.

I understand there is an email out, which I haven't received, telling us that 
the people will be moving back into their offices tomorrow.  The next phase 
will start next week.  People have to be out of their offices by August 
23rd.  That'll work out perfectly!  I'll have you packed up and hopefully 
somewhere to put everything.  I've ordered boxes and packing bubbles for your 
photographs.  Anyway, I'm sure you'll get a memo.  He must have put it on the 
slowest possible method of getting to us.

Jim Grace came in yesterday, but I didn't say anything to him.  Dan, of 
course, had to say "how's it going" or something like that.  

Everything is fine here I guess.  I can't think of anything to report.  How 
are you doing?

Nope, not this time around.  No movie star.
Other then the work stuff, things are going well for me too.
I'm glad to hear that all is well for you (ferrarri and all...).  Do you
think they'll give me a car too if I
work for them?
In regards to space, I know what you mean.  I needed so much that I am no
longer married.  It was
not an easy decission or thing to do, but definetely the right one.  I've
been living in South Beach
for the past 8 months and lived with my mom for a little while before that.
Butch is doing well.  He is not reporting to Pedro anymore.  He is under a
new manager under
Ana doing web stuff.  He's been working extremely long hours and under a
lot of preassure.
They had to release new hardware.  I don't think things went very well.
I'll let him know you say hi.

Anyway...I'll call you next week and for sure you will be the 2nd, or maybe
third to know if I make it
out to Houston.

Don't work too hard.

Did they think that you were a movie star at the Sushi Bar?  How are things
going?  It is good to here from you.

I haven't travelled at all, I am now trading natural gas options here at
Enron.  I have been really busy.  I get into work around 6:15 and work
until about 6 on the evening.  I don't even leave my desk for lunch.  They
bring it to me.  I only have a chance to leave my desk for the special
things (haha).

I hope that you are well.  I still miss Florida and all my Floridian
buddies, but things are going well here.  My job is going really well
(promotion, big bonus, company ferrarri....).  Just kidding about the car.
But really everything is going well.  I just miss getting away.  Marriage
is good, but I think that everyone needs their space sometimes (you know
what I mean).

Well I better go.  Call me sometime. My work number is (713) 853-6247.  If
you every make it to Houston be sure to let me know.  Talk to you soon.

John

PS  How is Butch doing?  Tell him hi

Hi!  It has been a long time!  As you know things here are very shaky.  I can't believe the big E has crumbled!  Who would have ever guessed!  Everyone is completely disappointed and mostly pissed off.  I'll have to give you the inside scoop sometime when we get together!  And we need to!  I'll be traveling around making my rounds to find out what's in the market place soon. So, hopefully I'll get a chance to see you.  Any chance of you and Mark coming down?  We have plenty of room for the two of you; you're always welcome.  I love your house!  Thanks for sending the picture.  Its so exciting but its also a lot of work!  I'm glad I'm done!  It's nice to be in the house, but also funny all the work and effort you put in and how exciting it is all those months while you're in the process....all to be completely indifferent with it afterwards!  Its very strange, but what to do?  Natalie, I can't believe is 3!  And a very terrible 3.  My hands are full!  I'm contemplating of putting her in ski school this winter.  She quite the daring child, so I think she'll enjoy.  Ask Mark for me if this is too young.  She won't think so, its mostly my fear. =)  You'll get a kick of the pictures I've attached.  One of them is my depiction a young Penny Lane. Hopefully you saw Almost Famous to understand my analogy!  You'll also notice the Beagle that Bill bought for Natalie.  HAHA! His name is Presley.  She's absolutely in love with him. 

Keep in touch!

Hi Diana...haven't spoken to you in awhile so thought I'd drop you a note.
Hope all is well amongst this crazy market and confusing time.  

I assume you are in your new house and wondered how you are enjoying it as I
can't really imagine EVER moving in.  I am sure it will happen one day!
Below is a picture Mark took yesterday (just proof that it is really moving
ahead!) and thought I'd forward to you...perhaps you could give me your
opinion, based on it's current stage of construction, how much longer I
might be at my in-laws!?!?!?!?

Take care!

I haven't done that in quite awhile!!  I am meeting Ruge and a few other KC Fiji boys, and Blair is coming from Denver.  I haven't been to Manhattan in 3 years or so, and haven't been to a KState f-ball game(in Manhattan) since the 97' season!  It's homecoming, so it should be a pretty fun weekend...of course now that I'm 10 years older than most of the kids there, I may have to be careful I don't get arrested for Child Molesting!!
haha

How's everything else treating you?  I am headed back to Vail around the 5th of Nov., to drive snowcats for the winter....
actually that's my night job....and the job that gets me my insurance and ski pass....I am getting a few photography deals going, so I will be doing that during the daylight hours(oh yeah...and skiing alot!!hehehe).

I actually check my codydownard@hotmail.com account more than this one, so start using that one por favor..

Let me know how everything is going!!

Perge!

Hey there Bill!

I thought I'd drop a quick line just to do a quick introduction of myself.
Your buddy, Brendan, has offered your tour guide ability to me when I visit
Portland in July.  I do have a college friend out there (who I hope to
locate) so you might not have to be stuck with me. :)

Anyhow I'm Nikki.  I'd go more into depth but everytime I write it out it
sounds more like a personal add then an introduction!

Brendan tells me you are about to close on a condo.  Congratulations!  I
can't wait to have a place of my own!  Apartment life is horrible.  My
neighbor and I knock on the bathroom wall at each other in the mornings just
to say "hi".  I'm really serious.  I actually have really great neighbors in
my building and I have to admit, apartment life is a good way to get to know
people.

I don't know what Brendan has told you about me but here's the story.  I was
born and raised in New Mexico and hate it here!  I need trees and green!
Someone once compared landing in New Mexico to landing in a litter box.
Where there's not dirt there's piles of crap.  Now everytime a plane flies
me back home I look around and agree.

So, to say the least I'm a little stir crazy for a new environment.  The
first part of August I will be moving to Newport Beach, California.  Or one
of four other beach communities in that area.  I want to experience that
whole lifestyle for at least a year.  Then I'm moving to Oregon.  I've never
visited or anything I'm just drawn there.  To be perfectly honest it's
because of the two movies "Goonies" and "Kindergarten Cop".  I loved those
movies as a kid and have wanted to move to Astoria ever since.  Now's my
chance.  I just finished college and have a period of resting time before I
go after my master's in Public Health Administration or my MBA.  We'll see
which fits me best later.  I don't feel that at 24 I can really decide the
"best" avenue for the next 50 years of my career so I'm waiting for the life
experience to kick in and lead the way later.

As of yet I have no set plans as to dates, iteneraries, etc and so forth.
I'm a very spontaneous type of person I don't really "do" planning and
scheduling.  I just kind of show up and try to make my own fun.  It's better
that way.  Life can be too organized!

Well now that I've given you a "short" introduction...haha.  I'd love to
hear back from you about any conflicting dates that you might have in July.
Don't worry if they change I won't hold ya to them.  The only time that I am
forecasting for myself is the 12th through the 16th (of July) IF I don't go
to Calgary, Canada.  Currently I'm planning as many trips as I possibly can.
My youth is fading fast and I need to enjoy as much of it as I possible
while I don't have a husband and kids to take care of. :)

Hope to hear from you soon!
Nikki

TXsscott5: hm....but he's on the gas floor?
joefreid: I think...but not sure, will find out
TXsscott5: ok...i can probably track him down....
TXsscott5: mo thinks i was a search dog in a former life
joefreid: haha
joefreid: are you one of those people that can find anything on the internet in less than 2 minutes?
TXsscott5: y
TXsscott5: :-)
TXsscott5: had a huge debate at work yesterday
TXsscott5: is there such a thing as too much water....for consumption purposes
TXsscott5: i was battling almost everyone claiming that the law of diminishing returns applies even to good, old-fashioned water
joefreid: personally? or from a macroeconomic sense (property rights in the West, blah, blah, blah
TXsscott5: personally, as in water in-take into the human body
TXsscott5: and there is such a thing....and it can cause a condition known as water intoxication...
TXsscott5: it's so gratifying to be right ;
TXsscott5: ;-)
joefreid: yes, I buy into the law of diminishing returns.  I've heard of water intoxication and I agree with your assessment
joefreid: that doesn't mean you are right
joefreid: though
TXsscott5: why not?
joefreid: my bad...because you found info on Water Intoxification you are right.  I though you were saying b/c i agreed with you, you were right
TXsscott5: oh...ha
TXsscott5: people were attacking me...saying, "no amount of water can be bad for you" etc. etc.
TXsscott5: and i replied, "at some point your body can't process the water...the system has to overload"
joefreid: too much of anything is bad for you....way to overpower them with your tremendous intellect
TXsscott5: ha
TXsscott5: thx
TXsscott5: i think i've scared them all know
TXsscott5: now
joefreid: Cow them into submission
TXsscott5: i always do....could be why i've heard the words, "you're intimidating" more than once in my lifetime
TXsscott5: oh well....i gotta be me
joefreid: not necessarily a bad thing....when used in moderation
joefreid: Law of Diminishing Returns again...it is everywhere
TXsscott5: ha
TXsscott5: so true
TXsscott5: seriously though....i may have issues w/ challenges and/or the gauntlet being thrown down....i hate being wrong, but i'd rather be wrong than not know the correct answer
joefreid: ...so as long as you can gain the knowledge you are ok?
joefreid: insatiable intellectual curiosity?
TXsscott5: oh, i'll be a little bitter for a while that i was wrong...but i get over it and then i have the knowledge from there on out...so i come out ahead
joefreid: ...I am the guy that will look out the airplane window and marvel how the "wing" provides lift.  The physics of it all and who in the world came up with that?
TXsscott5: that one still gets me
TXsscott5: i mean, really....how cool is that
TXsscott5: this giant heap of metal....airborne
TXsscott5: i took the aviation ground course in college as an elective
joefreid: is it and extrapolation of Bernoulli's Principle
joefreid: ?
TXsscott5: ok...engineer talking to business major
TXsscott5: heard of the principle...but couldn't define it for you 
TXsscott5: ;(
TXsscott5: :-(
joefreid: i realize the whole greater distance over the top of the wing creates a faster wind velocity above than below the wing and therefore causes a pressure differential (low above, high below and this "lifts" the wing.  But it the newtons of lift is dependent upon the shape of the wing, the airflow over it, etc...
TXsscott5: ok.....i'm officially impressed....my dad could talk to you for HOURS
joefreid: That is why for the longest time, maybe even still today, the wings are the most difficult aspect of the plane to reproduce.  Other countries would love for Boeing to outsource the construction of the wing so they could learn how to make it.
joefreid: I'm sure your father would shame me
TXsscott5: no....i doubt, but it would make for some interesting discussion

THanks for the pics!  They're great...one thing, I can not believe you got
another dog!!  That story still kills me! Glad to hear your house has worked
out so nicely...I trust that you've sold your other house and all is good.
I would love to get together with you anytime soon...if you are not going to
be around here in the near future, I will come there and see you.  I've not
been to your trade floor for years now.  Just let me know when you thought
you might be around here and if not, I'll make arrangements to go down
there.  I hope that you're not in a panic yet...you just never know until
the full shakeout hapens what will take place.

I have forwarded you below a couple of pics of the dogs (my parents-in-law's
dog and my dog, Oakley)  Oakley is the chocolate one. I will be sure to keep
in touch with you and pls do the same.
Cheers! <<17080007.jpg>>  <<17080009.jpg>>

		 Subject: Calypso Tribal Letters

Friends,

The statute should be reviewed by whichever lawyer is supporting the project. 

 As I mentioned to Alice Weekley, I am unfamiliar with the recent amendments 
referenced requiring the notice for projects that do not actually cross 
reservation property. The amendment does not surprise me though. 

 In the past, for example, during the Transwestern expansion in '91, we 
developed a comprehensive NAGPRA plan with tribes whose reservations we 
crossed, yet neighboring tribes were included--the thinking by the various 
State Historic Preservation officers was that unearthed remains (bones, 
funerial objects, pottery pieces, holy objects, etc) may have belonged to 
tribes other than those from whose reservation they were ultimately 
unearthed.  It made for a VERY VERY long and complicated plan and 
consultation process....not only when objects were unearthed, but simply 
putting the required anticipatory plan and procedures in place PRIOR to 
construction.  (It gives me a chuckle: my late husband, Leonard Hilton, who 
was in charge of the TW project, is likely rolling in his own grave at the 
mere thought of Enron having to put another of these plans 
together..Haha!!)   As I said, I've not read the amendment , but hopefully it 
only legally requires 'notice'---yet, in my nearly 20 years of practicing 
law, I've rarely seen  a 'notice' that didn't crack the door or sound the 
alarm of further buerocratic opportunity!

For your further information, I have met Billie Ray Cypress personally and 
he's a decent and seemingly reasonable guy with a huge casino on the rez ; 
yet these personal attributes frequently go by the wayside when it comes to 
'perceived economic opportunity'.  
 Chief James Billie,[chief of the Seminoles, 2nd largest/2nd wealthiest tribe 
in North America] on the other hand, is shrewd in business, dictitorial in 
management, and personally , has an ego bigger than Texas, behavior to match, 
and is proud of it!! --which makes him a ton of fun to be with if he likes 
you--he wrestles alligators, writes rock and roll and "plays"in whatever 
stage opportunity is presented him--as long as he can be the center of 
attention.  The Seminoles have not only a tribal web site, James Billie has 
his own!!  Check it out--it's a hoot!!  He has been chief for about 25 years 
(and I'm guessing he's maybe in his early 50's).  The Seminoles have 
recognized significant economic development under James, but he is definitely 
a "My way or the highway" kind of guy--he loves you, hates you, or ignores 
you--and he has a tribal council that is respectfully terrified of him. If 
any activity smacks of anything James Billie doesn't like, he'll know no 
limits in stopping it...remember, this guy wrestles alligators!! No Joke!

I don't recognize the other names on the list, but I think it's clear from 
both the beurocratic issues, as well as the specific tribal issues incident 
to each affected tribe, everything associated with the process should be 
executed with all of this in mind.  I'd be happy to speak with the project's 
lawyer to discuss this further, if information beyond that set forth above 
would be helpful.

Thanks!

--Christie.
