Given the current tremendous energy market volatility and as we stretch

appropriate to postpone the ENA 2000 Offsite to early next year.  I trust 
this meets with your approval and thanks for all the hard work.

Sheri:

Thanks for the response.  Our next dinner is scheduled for September 25, at
the moment I'm not sure who the other invitees would be.  Jerry would
probably have a better idea as he puts together the guest list for each
event and may already have something in mind.  That's actually another
reason why I think we should leave the call tomorrow on the calendar.
Depending on Mr. Skillings availability/interest Jerry might want to
reconfigure his invitee list for the most appropriate mix of people.

Probably the best thing is for the call to go ahead, that way Jerry can

year and Mr. Skilling can decide on the best one for him to attend.

Does that sound feasible to you?

Lynett and Cindy:

Greetings from Houston!

I have a special request for you.  In order for us to prepare our campus
recruiting strategy for next fall, I need information regarding
internship
recruiting.

As you know, we decided to concentrate our spring 2001 effort on intern
recruiting and interviewing.  In order for us to ensure that we are
being
effective with this strategy, I need to know which companies interviewed
for summer interns during the fall 2000 recruiting season.  Companies of
particular interest would be El Paso, Williams, Dynegy, Duke, consulting
firms such as McKinsey, and Big 5 accounting firms.

By providing this information, you would greatly assist our effort for
upcoming years.

Thank you in advance for your assistance.

Sincerely,

Lexi Elliott

things to talk about at this point in time.

Dave,

FYI on the content of this proposed interview.

My suggestion to PR was to have you and/or John L. be the primary 
interviewees, with me sitting by your side to add local commentary (if 
needed).  I was trying to take the story in the following direction:  Enron 
is now applying its successful NA business model to South America...these are 
the things we will be doing now...these are the things we will be doing in 
the future...discuss logic of the split of assets versus commercial business 
units...this is a natural step in the evolution of the South AMerican market 
and in the evolution of Enron...etc.

I have not called you since I figure you are crushed under the post holiday 
"pile".  I will be in Houston Thursday (one day ahead of PRC) in the EB on 
floor 49.

We are surviving down here and moving forward.  I need to pick your brain 
about an agenda for your visit next week when convenient for you (earlier is 
obviously better for us)

Thanks,

Kish

Hi Keith,
Here's some thoughts we have on the story. Of course, like Enron, we're
willing to be flexible, depending on what we find out.

 Since it began in 1985, Enron has always been in the vanguard of U.S.
companies getting into new markets overseas, from India, where the company
made the largest single private investment in the country's history, to
Japan where the company recently announced it will build its first power
plant. How has the company overcome political obstacles and cultural
differences to establish itself internationally?
 This will focus more on South America than the rest of the world. I'll
look
at the transition from working on pipeline projects in South America to the
more service-oriented business in Argentina. Also, what about workers - do
you hire local management and oversee the operations from Houston? IF so,
why? I'll also look at the pipeline and the creation of this natural gas
market in South America. How did the project ultimately turn out for
residents & customers there? What does Enron see in its future in South
America.


I know this is pretty vague, but I expect to do more research in the coming
weeks and have it more ironed out.

Kevin, I'll have a sedan from Beal's (713.731.9233) pick you up at the Four Seasons and bring you to the facility.  Once you get inside, there will be a check-in table - the ladies manning that table can direct you to Jeff.  Would you like me to have the sedan stand by to tke you to the airport or another destination following the panel (which will end between 9:30 and 9:45)?  Please advise.  Thanks, SRS

It would be a HUGE help if a car could meet me at the Four Seasons (1300
Lamar Street) about 7:15.  Just let me know, otherwise I will take a cab.

Where should we meet with Jeff tomorrow at 8:15??

Kevin, I got your message about not being available for dinner -  no
problem.  The other panelists were arriving too late also, so the dinner
was cancelled.

I just wanted to touch base and make sure you had everything thing you need
for tomorrow morning.  I'm attaching a map to the North Shepherd facility;
it's about 10 minutes outside of downtown.  I would be happy to make
arrangements for a sedan to pick you up if you like; just let me know from
where.

The event begins with a buffet breakfast at 7:30 a.m. and your panel will
begin at 8:45 a.m.  Jeff would like to meet with you, David Arnoff  and
John Thornton around 8:15 a.m. to cover any last minute items about the
panel.
I'll be at the North Shepherd facility beginning about 2:00 p.m. CDT today,
so you can reach me on my cell phone (713.854.1426).  Do not hesitate to
call me should you have any questions or need additional information as I
will not have access to e-mail after 2:00 p.m.

be whipped into shape by Thursday, I think that we need to boil it down to a 
few themes that we present at the group meeting.  We then can finish the

Subject: Re: Edited Draft of FERC Presentation


Jim and others,

I think we are suffering from not enough time to fully iterate this, as well 
as little information on what
others are going present.

The basic messages as I see them (and not having trued this up with Mary or 
others) are:

1.  The markets are working consistent with physics and economics; demand is 
up, supplies are down and higher
prices are resulting.
2. Characteristics of the retail markets have resulted in risks being passed 
to end users.  Are such issues
impeding wholesale markets?  If so, perhaps FERC can influence movement in 
this area.
3. We shouldn't equate outcomes at the retail level with bad structure at 
wholesale level.  The key is to
distinguish the retail issues so that FERC can focus on the wholesale issues.
4. Any remaining concerns should be studied further rather than simply 
receiving blame for the outcomes we've
seen:  Whether there is market power?  Whether rather it's a matter of 
scarcity rents?  What are appropriate
scarcity rents?  Is monopsony power on the buyers' side (utilities) causing 
undesirable economic and reliability
outcomes.   (And out of this should be consideration of whether an 
across-the-board $250 cap is the right one,
especially given that the ISO staff itself recognizes that this is a poor 
proxy for what buyers are willing to
pay as scarcity rents.)

That's my 2 cents.  I don't know what Mary's additional thoughts are, nor how 
what other parties will say may
affect what we should emphasize.

Certainly, though, your feedback is invaluable.  If you reply with feedback 
I'll do what I can to see that
Enron's message reflects your preferences.

Hi Kevin,

Thanks for the message. PIRA doesn't have any relationships and/or
agreements with UBS Warburg.

I know Tim Belden in Portland wants to restore several services. Please let
me know the number of people (licensed users) and locations for each
retainer service so I can give you a quote for site licensing fees.

Fletch Sturm (works for me and runs the MW power group) will be following

   Hi Tim,

   Thank you the phone message about your continued  interest in PIRA
   Energy Group. I look forward to hearing from you or Kevin  Presto about
   the PIRA analytical services you want to purchase for  your new
   business. (Kevin, I work for Allan Stewart in  PIRA's electricity group
   and also handle sales/marketing of PIRA's  services.)

   Attached  is a description of PIRA's service offerings and an Excel file
   showing a  price matrix with annual fees.   Our base retainer service is
   for up to 10  users at one site (office location) under a site license
   agreement. One retainer  is $25,000 (e.g., natural gas), two retainers
   are $35,000 (e.g.,  electricity and natural gas) and three retainers are
   $40,000 (add  oil).  Fees for additional services such as emissions
   market  intelligence and the daily electricity demand forecast are shown
   to the right of  the main table. Clients with  users of PIRA's services
   in multiple offices can arrange a site license for  higher usage.

                   This letter is to ask to please check into the

irregularities that are going on in your company Pro-Caribe in Puerto Rico.

In this company there seems to be preference for two employees which are the

favorites between managment, mr. Roberto Aponte and mr. Rafael Medina.  The

two employees do not work rotating shifts they have a steady day job make

more money than the other employees overtime is always given to them a one

our break while  the other employees have to sit back and are not able to do

anything about it because if they do they will be put on suspension and their

company motto is ," If you dont like it quit".  All the recognitions and cash

prices go to these two individuals they always come out employee of the year

or the trimestrial plant operator and then again there not plant operators.

There is no opportunity for other employees to advance at this site because

of the discrimination and abuses  going on towards them and which is clearly

evident.   Actually these two individuals hold the post that when there is an

incoming ship they have to attend to it but lately this ship is not coming in

as ofthen as it used to and yet this individualsstill earn the extra money

without lifting a finger.   Some of the priviliges they have is that they do

not have to work rotating shifts and   they are off on holidays  meanwhile

the other employees have to work the rotating shifts, work holidays and make

less money.  Please mr. Loy it is in your hands to make justice for the other

employees who work hard and yet they dont seem to be appreciated.  All

promotions and recognitions are based on the fact that the two employees have

bought their way to their current positions by bringing in gifts and taking

their employers out to dinner.  This action which i believe is wrong because

it is just like taking a bribe.   Once again mr. Loy i ask for your help and

hope you will be able to investigate and be able to straighten out this

situation.  I have witness these events and i do not like any type of

discrimination i leave it in your hands.

(1) PERSONAL EMAIL: can be kept, discarded,
etc. at will.

(2) BUSINESS EMAIL: do not delete any
business email sent or received for 24 hours.  This 24 hour delay will allow
the network to save a backup copy of the email.  After 24 hours, BUSINESS
EMAIL may be kept, discarded, etc. at will.

(3) WORD PROCESSING FILES OR FILE FRAGMENTS:
do not delete any SAVED FILE or any FILE FRAGMENT.  This policy covers any

you run out of disk space on your personal computer, you may copy files to
the network (where they will be backed up), then delete the files from your
personal computer to create the work space you need.  DO NOT DELETE ANY FILE
BEFORE YOU HAVE COPIED IT TO THE NETWORK.

Body:
Enron's General Counsel sent out an e-mail this morning defining data and document retention policies relating to SEC Investigations and Shareholder Class Action lawsuits.  The e-mail, which appears below, goes on to explain that we should otherwise return to "our normal electronic document retention policy."

I want to remind everybody that the new document retention requirements are in addition to this office's current document retention policy.  Specifically, the policies that we have agreed to with the California Attorney General remain in effect.  As a reminder, I have included our policy below.  Each person in the Portland office needs to be aware of and continue to comply with our data retention policies. 

If you have any questions or concerns please let me know.


The purpose of this message is to update employees on the
status of the California Attorney General's order regarding the preservation
of business information.  Please NOTE THE IMPORTANT POLICIES DESCRIBED
BELOW.

Please continue to ahdere to the following business information retention policies:

(1) PERSONAL EMAIL: can be kept, discarded,
etc. at will.

(2) BUSINESS EMAIL: do not delete any
business email sent or received for 24 hours.  This 24 hour delay will allow
the network to save a backup copy of the email.  After 24 hours, BUSINESS
EMAIL may be kept, discarded, etc. at will.

(3) WORD PROCESSING FILES OR FILE FRAGMENTS:
do not delete any SAVED FILE or any FILE FRAGMENT.  This policy covers any
FILE or FILE FRAGMENT that you have saved on your hard disk or the network.

(4) DATABASES: do not delete any information
in DATABASES.

(5) EXCEL SPREADSHEETS: do not delete any
information in EXCEL SPREADSHEETS.

(6) CALENDARS OR SCHEDULING PROGRAMS: do not
delete any information.

(7) OTHER ELECTRONIC DATA: do not delete any
OTHER ELECTRONIC DATA.

(8) HARD DRIVE CAPACITY: in the event that
you run out of disk space on your personal computer, you may copy files to
the network (where they will be backed up), then delete the files from your
personal computer to create the work space you need.  DO NOT DELETE ANY FILE
BEFORE YOU HAVE COPIED IT TO THE NETWORK.

Attached are two versions of a press release.  We plan to issue one of these before market open tomorrow.  The second version assumes financial close on the remainder of the secured credit facility (I need someone to confirm or deny).  The first version speaks only to the merger and our debt restructuring efforts.  Please review and provide comments as soon as possible to me and Karen Denne (karen.denne@enron.com).  I understand that Jeff McMahon and Jimmy Lee will discuss the attached at 7:00 CST tomorrow.

George,

Thanks for the note and the message. I will try to call you later today, but
will send this note just in case I miss you.

While I am interested in following up with Tim about our project in the NW,
there are two other more pressing reasons for talking with the right guys at
Enron. First, we have just secured the rights to a 1600 MW plant in Texas -
permitting complete and just about ready for financing. We are also close to
securing the rights to a 800 MW project in Oklahoma. So we would like to
talk about tolling, etc. for both of those plants.

Also, word on the street is that Enron is not only selling existing
generating stations, but also its projects under development. I think I saw
a report that your CEO denied this. But, if there is any truth in the
statement, we would like to follow up, especially concerning the development
sites. It may be possible for us to take over development and have a tie
back to Enron for the marketing (and perhaps the operations) of the project.

Hope you are enjoying London,

Cheers,

Chuck

Chas - I left a message on your voice mail regarding Tim Belden, who heads
up our west power desk.  Tim can be reached at 503-464-3820 (Portland).

Tim - Chuck Brown is a principal in Newport Generation (Irvine), and is
developing a gas- fired merchant generating station in the Pacific
Northwest.  He would like to talk with you about a PPA / marketing
agreement for the output of the station.  His number is 949-475-9570.
Please contact Chuck to discuss the details.  Thanks.

I am in London this week and can be reached at 44-20-7783-4160 if either of
you would like any additional information.  Otherwise I leave it in your
capable hands to get together.

Cheers,

George

Ike, it is unfortunate we could not make this work yesterday; but I 
understand your position.  In the interest of facilitating continuing

Dave

Thanks for your September 25 email.  TVA is currently developing the numbers
we agreed to share in our meeting last week, but given the importance of
this effort, TVA is going to need additional time.  Trying to complete the
task by this afternoon did not prove feasible.  We can, however, have this
information ready by October 13.

I will give you a call to discuss a mutually satisfactory method for
exchanging the information.

Regards
Ike Zeringue

Subject: Final Commission Decision on Rate Design

At the continuation meeting held this afternoon, the Commission voted out
the Alternate Proposed Decision on SCE/PG&E rate design.  The vote was 3 to
2, with Bilas and Duque voting "no".

Absent a close reading (which I have not had the opportunity to do yet), it
is difficult to discern all the changes made to the alternate as it was not
put out in a red-lined form.  While the version voted out today contains a
lot more verbiage supporting the previously made resolutions of the issues,
the only real substantive changes made appear to be (1) it lowers the cap on
agricultural customers rate increases from 30% to 20% for agricultural TOU
customers, and to 15% for agricultural non-TOU customers; and (2) it places
an average rate increase cap on industrial customers.  For PG&E, this
average rate increase cap is 12.3 cents/kWh; for SCE its $12.9 cents/kWh.
The decision does not contain alot of explanation on the industrial cap.  I
am assuming that the "average rate increase" refers to the average across
TOU periods.

I will review the Decision more closely, providing a complete summary
tomorrow.  In the mean time, if you have any questions, please call.

Subject: CONFIDENTIAL - Tennessee political contributions

On September 29th I sent you an email regarding requests for personal 
political contributions to Tennessee lawmakers.  If you or any others intend 
to make contributions they need to be handled as soon as possible.   The 
election is less than 3 weeks away and the campaigns are making final 
decisions on media spending.  Attached is a recent plea from our lobbying 
firm in Nashville.

The reason contributions must be personal in Tennessee is because state law 
prohibits contributions from corporations and from political action 
committees that receive financial support from corporations (Enron Corp. 
supports the Enron PAC by paying its expenses such as employee time, office 
materials, etc...).  Tennessee is one of the few states to implement such a 
stringent campaign finance law. 

The decision on whether or not to provide support for key legislators is up 
to the business units with interests in Tennessee. 

If you need further information or would like to discuss this, you can reach 
me at 614-760-7472 or 614-306-4359 (cell).

Subject: CONFIDENTIAL - Tennessee political contributions


Barbara, we are getting tremendous pressure for contributions in these last 
days before the election.  As I have mentioned to you, Enron has been 
referred to specifically by one of the most powerful Senators.  Also, Lt. 
Gov. Wilder's campaign chairman called me in the latter part of last week, 
hoping for significant financial help for end-of-campaign TV buys.  Gif 
Thornton, Robert Gowan, and I are participating heavily; I cannot 
overemphasize the importance of Enron's participation.  The state "money 
crunch" which existed this past year likely will be worse when the General 
Assembly reconvenes (tax collections are coming in below estimates), and all 
existing tax exemptions will be at significant risk.  Please do what you can 
to get some Enron assistance for the candidates which we have discussed now.  
Thanks.  Bill

FYI - Attached is a complaint filed by CARE on April 16 against BC Hydro, Powerex, Mirant and BPA (with the LADWP thrown in as an unnamed respondent).  The complaint is principally directed against BC Hydro and Powerex.  It essentially accuses BC Hydro and Powerex of manipulating the reservoirs in BC and transmission capacity reserved by Powerex on the BPA system to COB and NOB to withhold power during a period of peak demand "to contrive a shortage and test their market power."  CARE accuses BC Hydro and Powerex of violating Section 206 of the FPA, state and federal anti-trust laws, the civil rights of Californians under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and NAFTA.

The complaint is long on sensational allegations and short on facts.  The evidence proffered in the complaint consists of a rant off the YAHOO Message Board by an unnamed power trader in Spokane (we think it is an Avista trader), selected transmission data from the ISO, the LA Times article of April 11, 2001 regarding the ISO's report on Powerex, BPA and LADWP, the ISO report itself, and BC Hydro's residential rate schedule.  CARE requests FERC to initiate an investigation, seeks unspecified refunds and punitive damages and also appears to want FERC to have the Secretary of DOE declare an emergency under Section 202(c) of the FPA and compel deliveries of electricity.

FERC has noticed the complaint and has established May 8 as the due date for interventions and responses.

Rick / Vince,

Good morning.

In my 9/14 e-mail, I advised you of the practitioner-industry CEFER (Center
for Energy Finance Education and Research) Conference we are planning for
Spring 2001.  As you know, we would like to invite Jeff Skilling to be the
keynote speaker at the Thur. evening dinner.  The following day's four
topics consist of Risk management, Deregulation, Real options, and
International/globalization.  The majority of invitees would be
(predominantly U. S.-based) energy-industry practitioners, as well as
several academics.

Given lead time issues in these matters, we have reserved hotel rooms in
Austin for Feb. 22, 2001.  Could I ask you to ascertain Jeff Skilling's
availability for that evening?

Thanks,
Ehud Ronn

My dear friends & teammates: Dave, Max, Steve, Marc, Ricardo, Jaime & Agust?n,

 As we say in Spanish:      "LO PROMETIDO ES DEUDA"

You must remember that  last year I made an invitation to the Mexican team, 
to my house in Puerto Escondido, Oax.
to celebrate the financial closure of the Vitro Project, and the excellent 
results of year 2000.

The dates selected are Friday, Feb. 16 to Sunday, Feb. 18. I have reserved 
Airplane seats on Aereocaribe, leaving
Mexico City on Feb 15, 6:20 P.M., and returning Feb. 18, 8:40 P.M.

This will be an all bachelor's weekend, with Marlin fishing, water skying, 
surfing (if you can do it), etc., etc., etc.
Please reserve the dates, and let me know if you can join in.

Regards, jaime____

Hi Rick,
I'm in the process of planning the U.T. 2001 Fourth Year PPA Fall Lyceum series scheduled for every Wednesday in the fall.  As you know, this series brings to campus distinguished practitioners who address our 4th Year PPAs (the equivalent of college seniors) on current issues in accounting and current trends in business.  Last year, you delivered a presentation in this Lyceum on "Global Equity Markets."
I'd like to invite you back this year to make a presentation on Wednesday, September 12, from 4:00 to 5:15 p.m. (new time) in UTC 2.102A.   This presentation would be in addition to the Enron company presentation scheduled for Monday, September 10 at the same time and place.  Please let me know (1) if the Wednesday date is convenient for you, and (2) the topic you would like to discuss.  Also let me know if I can facilitate your presentation in any way.
Best wishes,
Rick

Subject: FERC Staff Investigations on Midwest and Southeast Bulk Power Systems


On 11/1/00, FERC Staff issued reports on its Investigation of Bulk Power 
Markets in the Eastern Interconnection.  These reports were the result of a 
Commission order earlier this summer.  Enron's Federal regulatory staff 
(Christi, Charles Yeung, and Sarah Novosel) provided a great deal of 
information for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discussed 
many of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff, Scott Miller 
(who recently joined FERC from PG&E Gen).    While the Commission is under no 
obligation to take any of Staff's recommendations, the Commission typically 
looks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues.  Importantly, 
Staff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the 
Southeast and Midwest -- all of which Enron has been asking FERC to implement 
for several years:

Reduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by 
requiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other 
transmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to 
favor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of 
interconnection requests.

While the Staff Hotline is used productively, the Commission can direct Staff 
to conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of 
complaints.

The Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a pro 
forma interconnection process specific to interconnection, rather than simply 
relying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and 
procedures.

Require TPs to retain real-time transmission data on market functions 
pertaining to daily load, internal generation to meet that load, and imports 
and exports.

RTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC, as well 
as standardized criteria for curtailment.  In addition, since even such 
standardized criteria might not "get to the root of the problem" -- that 
control area still control generation -- the Commission could require that 
each RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area.  
Regardless of the implementation of these two options, the Commission could 
standardize ATC and TTC methodology.

Staff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristics 
similar to many other commodities, it is still viewed as "different," with a 
reaction of price caps.  Staff encourages that basic decisions about the 
regulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a 
traditional cost-of-service model to a model that uses markets to price the 
commodity and services.  

DETAILS  (Also, the reports contain good summaries of the generation, 
transmission, state retail, federal reg. and other issues for the region):

Midwest:  The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission 
Providers ("TPs") that control transmission, generation and load.  "As such, 
they have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission service 
to third-parties and strong incentives to favor their own services."  Staff 
received numerous complaints; however, due to the lack of information 
available from TPs, Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated 
incidents or wide-spread.  At the very least, the complaints indicate a lack 
of confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participants 
to rely on transmission access, thus harming the liquidity of the market.  

TLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest, with an 
"enormous" increase in 2000.  The region showed a decline in peak load from 
1999 to 2000 and a growth in new generation since the 1998 price spikes.  
Even though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with 
virtually no price spikes, TLRs climbed to record numbers.  The TLRs were 
highly concentrated:  only 5 flowgates account for 41% of ECAR TLRs and 
another 5 flowgates in MAIN account for 42% in that region.  Notably, even 
though the NERC procedures for Level 3 TLRs mandate transaction curtailment, 
78 of the 191 TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount.  The 
total amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are 
not posted.  Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC, whose 
procedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties.  While the Commission 
has required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open 
Access Transmission Tariffs ("OATT") where the Commission has the power to 
enforce provisions under the Federal Power Act, in practice the Commission 
has generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions, 
including the propriety of TLRs.

TLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market 
because load is not served by the least cost supplier.  TLR procedure is an 
inefficient instrument in mitigating constraints -- curtailment by fiat.  In 
addition, the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increased 
loading on the affected flowgate.  The impact could be mitigated by one 
control area per RTO.

Staff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for 
price caps following the 1998 price spikes.  Some market participants believe 
that the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction 
increased in the Midwest.  

Market participants must keep track of, and follow, a plethora of information 
in order to make energy deals, submit reservations and provide schedules for 
service.  Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission 
access, including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information and 
protocols, particularly for ATC and interconnection requests, and 
discriminatory conduct.  Unbelievably, key data was unavailable to Staff, 
such coincident peak load data, system-wide snap shots for days when TLRs 
were called, and import/export data.  This lack of data creates a market 
inefficiency, because neither market participants nor regulators can fully 
analyze market conditions in real time.  As such, the market is risk adverse, 
eschewing long-term deals for short-term transactions.  Staff also noted that 
because the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU, there is a mixed 
incentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the 
IOU.  (Staff cites Richard Tabors' paper, "Transmission Markets, Stretching 
the Rules for Fun and Profit.")

Staff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site, 
particularly about real time TLRs and curtailments.  Examples were provided 
to Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improper 
implementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss.

The currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems; however, all 
three retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and 
native load.  These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO 
exercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security 
coordinator functions.  Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region 
of 61 control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM.  The 
result is that ATCs can be different on 2 different sides of an interface.  
Staff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staff's own ATC audit 
this summer was consistent with market participant complaints.  Staff is 
weighing follow-up options.  The result of these problems is a lack of 
liquidity.

Staff next noted the problems with unfiled "business practices," especially 
on the next hour market.  Staff's audit of OASIS sites revealed several areas 
of non-compliance.  

Information transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently, 
with equal and timely access to data, including ATC, CBM, TRM, and load flow 
input data.  TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information 
transparent because of native load.  This incentive will still exist under 
RTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC.  ***  "As a 
consequence, the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption 
and have all transactions under the same tariff."  ***  The Commission could 
benefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require the 
TPs to retain data, including current real-time network status.

Interconnection Issues:  IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support.  Also, 
Staff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits 
or failing to complete System Impact Studies timely.  One solution is to have 
the RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities have 
against IPPs.  The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide 
variety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the 
region.

Network service has inherent advantages over point-to-point, citing the 
Entergy source and sink order.  The Commission has relied on "passively" 
receiving informal and formal complaints to determine if discriminatory 
behavior has occurred rather than actively canvassing market participants.  
While Staff cannot conclude that discriminatory practices are widespread, 
there is evidence of discriminatory instances.


Southeast:  The traditional vertically integrated utility ("VIU") model has 
largely persisted in the SE.  This continued control has vastly reduced the 
economic incentives to facilitate IPP activities.  In many cases, the VIUs 
have dampened IPP involvement without violating any Commission regulation due 
to the inherent flexibility of the current rules.

Staff cites examples of delays in performing system impact studies, 
transmission hoarding in the name of serving native load growth and 
manipulation of ATC.  TPs have shown little inclination to improve the 
transmission system and use many TLRs.

There is also a lack of market information that has stymied the development 
of markets in the SE.  ATCs change constantly that leads to uncertainty and 
there is no clearinghouse for electric power prices.

TVA, despite having taken steps to participate in reformed markets, has acted 
as a bulwark against the development of competitive energy markets in the 
SE.  This is significant because of TVA's size and location.  IPPs have 
reported TVA's discouragement of siting in TVA through excessive time to 
perform studies, excessive fees, and rejection of requests to perform 
interconnection studies.

In addition, Staff cites the Florida Sup. Ct. decision against merchant 
plants as significantly impeding the competitive market in Florida.

Staff discusses the significant flow of power from the Midwest to the SE this 
summer.  Much of this resulted from the import of cheaper coal power, than 
the use of gas fired peakers due to higher gas prices.  Peak prices were 
radically lower this summer because utilities appear to have been better 
prepared for peak events through the use of forward contracts, increased 
generation capacity on line and reduced number of forced outages.  

SE utilities reported that they have not used market-based rates to 
extensively increase sales.  (Less used than in the midwest.)

The SE region lacks information, which has retarded the Staff's efforts to 
discern the truth about the numerous complaints about transmission in the SE 
(including ATC and TLRs).  Market participants seem to have less confidence 
in the SE market than in any other market region.  This appears to be 
justified based on Staff's investigations.  This lack of confidence 
discourages investment and participation in the markets.  Staff concludes 
that the Commission may need to be more prescriptive in terms of how 
transmission is allocated in the SE RTOs, since there are market concerns 
that the incumbents will continue to dominate operations.  The investigation 
found numerous problems in bad ATCs and TTCs and poor OASIS postings.  In 
addition, several OASIS audit logs actually erased historical data.  Staff 
thinks that additional affiliate transaction information should be posted.  
Staff could not obtain summer demand data and the Commission's lack of 
jurisdiction over TVA made it difficult to obtain transmission access 
information.

The Staff investigation revealed unclear interconnection procedures and lack 
of adherence to schedules and arbitrary cost estimates and deposits.  In 
addition, the TPs have reserved a huge amount of network transmission 
capacity, much of it reserved shortly after the IPP approached the TP to 
interconnect.  Staff cites the recent Skygen order in which Southern denied 
Skygen's request for transmission stating that the only option was the 
construction of an 80 mile 500 kv line that would take 8 years to complete.  
Staff solutions include allowing network requests by IPPs and limiting 
self-build capacity in the incumbent's territory.

ATC variations are a big problem in the SE.  SERC coordination of a 
standardized ATC is a long process and may not be resolved soon without 
direction from the Commission.  An improved method and improved communication 
are needed.

The SE experienced a 354% increase in TLRs this summer.  This increase raises 
the issue of whether curtailment has become an impediment to the competitive 
operation of the market in the SE.  Staff cites information provided by 
Charles Y. that an Ameren TLR was not implemented according to NERC 
criteria.  Staff also wonders if transmission is being oversold since TPs do 
not generally refund transmission revenues when TLRs are implemented.  RTOs 
must have a broad geographic area to internalize much of the constraints.  In 
addition, RTOs will adopt pricing mechanisms that obviate recourse to TLRs.  
However, if control areas are retained, VIUs will retain mixed incentives.

*** As noted in the Midwest report, the manner in which load is calculated 
weighs heavily on the value of this information.  This is an issue that the 
formation of RTOs may not resolve.  Eliminating native load exceptions -- ie, 
treating all load equally -- and placing all transactions under the same 
tariff may be an option that provides the right incentives for the provision 
of transparent and standardized information.

Finally, Staff describes specific problems with TVA and FP&L, TVA is a 
"problem area" for the Eastern Interconnect grid.  TVA is a transmission 
bottleneck due to the many TLRs called this summer.  The current federal law 
and lack of Commission jurisdiction are impediments to the development of 
deep and robust power markets in this area.  TVA simply has no strong 
incentive to provide effective and efficient transmission service.  In 
addition, the Commission does not have full information on TVA.  Staff lists 
a number of complaints against TVA, including unjustifiably increasing the 
tag deadline and allowing TVA Marketing, but not others, to sink and park 
power.  Staff concludes that recent proposals by TVA to enhance the 
development of markets and its system do not appear to have great potential.

A Staff audit of FP&L revealed violations of standards of conduct, including 
confidential information on FP&L's transmission system (including interchange 
information for other entities) posted on EMS systems that were available to 
FPL's merchant function.  Staff's report found that FP&L does not have an 
established procedure for review of EMS to ensure that information is not 
displayed in error.  It is "up to individual Managers discretion."  ((FRCC 
web site report dated 9/8/00)).  Violations such as these undermine 
competition.

Hi Jeff.

I am Mike's brother, Ronnie, living in San Diego and a member of the San
Diego Chapter of YPO.  With all the propaganda being spread about the
electricity and energy crisis we are experiencing here in California, I
thought it would be worthwhile to invite you to town to give us an
insider's view on what is really going on (aka, the "truth").  Is there
anyway you can find time in your busy schedule to visit us over dinner
with a short talk and a question and answer period.  The sooner the
better.

I will schedule a "special" meeting of our chapter to accommodate any
dates that work for you.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Enron has contracted with Cognitive Arts to develop a web-based training 
system to be available for use by all of Enron,s management.

The goals of this project are to:

Enhance communication in the five key areas identified from the recent ETC 
survey (the percentages indicate the number of employees agreeing with the 
following statements):
59%: Decisions are not communicated well
54%: Employees do not feel free to voice their opinions openly
55%: The company doesn,t act effectively on employee suggestions
70%: Communication is not good across departmental lines
61%: Employees are not encouraged to challenge established procedures and 
policies

You have been identified as someone who?gives?valuable feedback.  I am asking 
for approximately one and a half hours of your time to have an informal, 
on-camera conversation with  Cognitive Arts so that we can capture your 
stories and insights for inclusion into the system.  CogArts will be in 
Houston conducting these interviews during the week of October 23rd.  If you 
are available to  take part in these interviews, CogArts and myself  will 
contact you the week of October 16th to brief you on  the specific topics 
that will be covered and to answer any questions you may have.  Please let 
Stacey Dempsey, ext. 30945,  know if you would be available for an interview 
and when would be a good time for me to answer your questions.  Thank you for 
your support.

Also, I am attaching a document that briefly desribes the interview process- 
what to expect, how to prepare and it gives some suggestions on how you can 
shape your responses to make them as effective as possible.

Gil,

Jeff asked me to let you know that he really appreciates this opportunity, but his time in the office is at such a premium right now due to his heavy travel schedule, it would be difficult at best to work them in.  He has turned down several invitations to join boards because he just can't commit the time.  So, while he is flattered by their interest, if and when Mr. Quackenbush calls we will decline.

It was nice talking to you.  Glad to hear all is well.

Yours faithfully, Sherri ;-)

Jeff,

Great to see Enron and you doing so well.  Congratulations on the -belated-
CEO ship, the blowout first quarter,
and the recent piece in Bloomberg.

Since we last met Luminant has done a important and impactful work for Enron
(EES, Enron Networks, Global
Sourcing, Broadband among others).  The Oasis and the Websource Intranet
sites are examples of the results of
this work.  Phillippe recently selected Luminant as one five integrators
that Enron will use going forward.

David Quackenbush, Luminants COO, has been personally involved in leading
the work at Enron.  He and
Jim Corey Luminant's CEO would like to have the opportunity of meeting with
you, bringing you up to date
on the work, and inviting you to consider joining the Luminant board.

I am no longer affiliated with Luminant but David asked me to let you know
of their interest.  He will be
following up and seeing if there will be an opportunity for you to meet with
them.

Regards,

Gil Marmol

Mark,

I want to ask you for a favor.

One of my associates, Stinson Gibner, is making a presentation to the MBA 
students at
Texas A&M University next week.

Do you have a Power Point general presentation about Enron, emphasizing our 
growth,
creativity and employment opportunities? We could use it for presentations
we make on campuses to business and science students. There are many 
presentations available on our Intranet site, but the are outdated.

It was nice meeting you in San Antonio.

Subject:	FW: Portland General Electric:  Order Rejecting Tariff Amendments

FERC rejected the request by PGE to modify the Code of Conduct so that they could buy on EnronOnline.  Basically, FERC did not believe that buying thru EnronOnline was a guarantee that consumers in Oregon would not be harmed.  

FERC found that There is, for
     example, no assurance that the posted prices on EnronOnline                                     
     represent prevailing market prices.
          Applicants contend that, since PGE can transact with EPMI
     via EnronOnline only at the posted price, there can be no
     affiliate abuse.  We are not certain, however, that the posted
     price necessarily represents the market price.  While, on the
     surface, Enron Online may bear some resemblance to an index or an
     auction, the posted prices for any product may not be the result
     of a competitive market of multiple buyers and sellers; in fact,
     for sales the posted prices represent what EPMI is willing to
     sell at, and for purchases the posted prices represent what EPMI
     is willing to buy at.

FERC left open the idea that PGE could re-file to fix the affiliate abuse.

As soon as we hear anything else, I'll let you know.

     Enron Power Marketing, Inc.                  Docket No. ER01-2103-000


ORDER REJECTING TARIFF AMENDMENTS WITHOUT           PREJUDICE

                           (Issued July 20, 2001)

          In this order we reject, without prejudice, proposed
     amendments of Enron Power Marketing, Inc. (EPMI) and Portland
     General Electric (PGE) to their respective market-based rate
     tariffs that would allow them to make inter-affiliate sales using
     the EnronOnline trading platform.

     I.   Background

          On May 22, 2001, in separate filings, affiliates PGE in
     Docket No. ER01-2097-000 and EPMI in Docket No. ER01-2103-000
     (collectively Applicants) filed to amend their respective market-
     based rate schedules to allow for inter-affiliate sales through
     the EnronOnline trading platform, and to prohibit communication
     among affiliates regarding the contents of prices posted on
     EnronOnline or the times that PGE will be making trades on
                 1
     EnronOnline.   This amendment does not supplant the existing
     provisions of PGE's and EPMI's currently effective tariffs which
     allow for inter-affiliate sales subject to conditions that the
     Commission generally imposes on inter-affiliate sales where there
     are captive customers, e.g., allowing a public utility to sell to
     its affiliated power marketer only at a rate that is no lower
     than the rate it charges non-affiliates, requiring simultaneous
     offers to non-affiliates, or requiring use of a relevant,
     established index.  Rather, PGE and EPMI propose to amend their
     respective tariffs to add a provision by which they will make

               1
                The EnronOnline system is administered by Enron Networks,
          an Enron Corp. subsidiary.  EnronOnline is a free, Internet-
          based, transaction system which allows EPMI's customers to view
          real time prices from EPMI's traders and transact instantly
          online.  EnronOnline is not an EPMI application, but rather
          EnronOnline is a trading platform used as a tool by EPMI in
          buying from and selling power to third parties.







          Docket Nos. ER01-2097-000 -2-
          and ER01-2103-000

     inter-affiliate sales via EnronOnline, with restrictions
     different than those in place but that, they state, will still
     prevent affiliate abuse.  Applicants state that the Commission's
     requirements have become outdated due to recent developments in
     electronic commerce and, in particular, the Commission's
     requirement that "PGE post on its website notice of a potential
     purchase or sale with EPMI prior to PGE entering into the
     transaction with EPMI prohibits PGE from using EnronOnline, since
     EnronOnline offers only instantaneous transactions that do not
     provide for a waiting period before consummating the
                  2
     transaction."   According to Applicants, this deprives PGE of the
     ability to buy or sell power "from perhaps the largest marketer
                                                                3
     in its region, to the detriment of PGE and its ratepayers."

     II.  Notice of Filing and Interventions/Protests

          Notices of the filings were published in the Federal
     Register, 66 Fed. Reg. 29,939 (2001) (Docket No. ER01-2097-000),
     and 66 Fed. Reg. 30,180 (2001) (Docket No. ER01-2103-000), with
     motions to intervene and protests for both due on or before
     June 12, 2001.  None was filed.

     III. Discussion

          The Commission allows power marketers and their public
     utility affiliates to sell to one another at market-based rates
     when it can be assured that there is no possibility of affiliate
     abuse.  As the Commission has explained, affiliate abuse can
     occur when a traditional public utility with captive customers
     sells power at below-market prices to, or purchases power at
     above-market prices from, an affiliate without captive customers
     (such as a power marketer affiliate).  One way in which the
     Commission has sought to prevent this type of cross-subsidization
     by captive customers is to require the pricing of inter-affiliate
                                                             4
     sales at an established, relevant market price or index.
     Another way, when there is no assurance that the affiliates are
     transacting at the prevailing market price, is to adopt various
     conditions previously established by the Commission to prevent
                     5
     affiliate abuse.

          Docket Nos. ER01-2097-000 -3-
          and ER01-2103-000


          Here, Applicants request that the Commission permit them to
     use EnronOnline to make inter-affiliate sales, subject to the
     following restrictions that they contend provide sufficient
     protection against affiliate abuse.  PGE, when buying from EPMI
     using EnronOnline, will be required to "take the transaction
     price as posted that is generally applicable at a particular
                                                              6
     location without attempting to negotiate any adjustment."   In
                                                                  7
     addition, PGE will be prohibited from submitting Limit Orders  or
     engaging in any other type of transaction in which the identity
     of the counter-party is revealed to EPMI prior to the transaction
     being finalized.  Applicants also propose to amend their
     respective codes of conduct to preclude any communication
     regarding prices posted on EnronOnline.

          Applicants contend such restrictions ensure no affiliate
     abuse occurs since PGE will only be able to transact with EPMI at

          62,197-98 (1997) (Detroit Edison).  In GPU, the Commission
          allowed sales from a power marketer to its affiliated traditional
          public utility at a rate that was no higher than the lowest rate
          the public utility paid non-affiliates under certain standard
          supplier agreements.  Accord, First Energy Trading & Power

          FERC   61,311 (1998).  Detroit Edison provided that a traditional
          public utility may sell power to its affiliated power marketer
          only at a rate that is no lower than the rate it charges non-
          affiliates; that the utility simultaneously offer through its
          electronic bulletin board to sell to non-affiliates at the same
          rate offered to its affiliate; and that all prices charged to the
          affiliate be simultaneously posted on its electronic bulletin
          board.  Accord, Jersey Central Power & Light Co., 82 FERC
          61,023 at 61,071 (1998); Commonwealth Edison Co., 85 FERC

                In the case of a Limit Order on EnronOnline, EPMI would
          know the identity of the customer requesting a price higher or
          lower than that currently available.  Applications at 3.  While
          Applicants do not define "Limit Order," the common understanding
          is that, unlike a market order, which instructs a broker to
          transact immediately at whatever price is currently available in
          the marketplace, a limit order instructs a broker to fill the
          order only if certain conditions are met.  Generally, a limit
          order may be either a day order, in which case it expires when
          the market closes if unfilled, or good-until-canceled, in which
          case the limit order lasts until executed or canceled.







          Docket Nos. ER01-2097-000 -4-
          and ER01-2103-000

     the posted price (a price that is offered to all market
     participants) and there will be no transactions in which EPMI
     knows that PGE is the counter-party before the transaction is
     finalized.  Thus, Applicants contend that not only will PGE be
     unable to negotiate special terms with EPMI through EnronOnline,
     but EPMI will have no discretion to take actions which favor PGE.
     Applicants further offer that procedures are performed by
     computer and are not left to the discretion of any affiliate of
     PGE.  In addition, because the EnronOnline price is posted
     electronically and is available to all market participants,
     Applicants state that PGE's customers have the opportunity to
     transact with EPMI on EnronOnline on the same terms and
     conditions that are available to PGE.

          Applicants have failed to demonstrate that their proposed
     restrictions provide the same protections afforded under the
     Commission's affiliate abuse requirements and conditions (e.g.,
     protection against PGE buying too high or selling too low in its
                                           8
     transactions with its affiliate EPMI).   The thrust of
     Applicants' argument is that the Commission's affiliate abuse
     concerns are satisfied by using EnronOnline, a public medium, for
     selling power between affiliates.  We disagree.  While perhaps
     faster and easier to use than phone calls, faxes, or letters, an
     Internet-based platform is just another medium for trade, and
     speed and ease of use do not dictate that the Commission's
     affiliate abuse concerns have been satisfied.  There is, for
     example, no assurance that the posted prices on EnronOnline
                                        9
     represent prevailing market prices.

          Applicants contend that, since PGE can transact with EPMI
     via EnronOnline only at the posted price, there can be no
     affiliate abuse.  We are not certain, however, that the posted
     price necessarily represents the market price.  While, on the
     surface, Enron Online may bear some resemblance to an index or an
     auction, the posted prices for any product may not be the result
     of a competitive market of multiple buyers and sellers; in fact,
     for sales the posted prices represent what EPMI is willing to
     sell at, and for purchases the posted prices represent what EPMI
                          10
     is willing to buy at.    For other transactions through media
     other than EnronOnline, including other exchanges, EPMI might be

               8
                See supra notes 4-5 and accompanying text (citing cases
          that discuss Commission's underlying concerns with affiliate
          power sales).
               9
                See supra note 4 and accompanying text.
               10
                 All transaction on EnronOnline involve EPMI as a
          participant.  For sales, EPMI is the seller.  For purchases, EPMI
          is the buyer.







          Docket Nos. ER01-2097-000 -5-
          and ER01-2103-000
                                                              11
     willing to sell at lower prices and buy at higher prices.
     Moreover, Applicants provide no information about how product
     prices posted by EPMI are determined, or whether there would be
     any restrictions on what products PGE could trade via
     EnronOnline, or even whether there are other similar, but non-
     affiliated, Internet-based venues where PGE can electronically
     trade those products to attain similar benefits.

          Having failed to convince us that these affiliates will be
     transacting at a prevailing market price via EnronOnline, we now
     turn to whether the Applicants have met other conditions
     established by the Commission to prevent affiliate abuse.
     Regarding transactions in which EPMI may be purchasing from PGE
     through EnronOnline, there is nothing in the Applicants' proposed
     restrictions that would require PGE to
     simultaneously offer to sell to non-affiliates at the same rate
     offered to the affiliate.  The Commission requires that, with
     respect to any power offered to its affiliate, PGE make the same
     offer to unaffiliated entities at the same time through its
     electronic bulletin board.  But it is unclear whether PGE can or
     will make the same offer to non-affiliates.

          Applicants also offer as a protection that PGE is prohibited
     from submitting Limit Orders, which would prevent EPMI from
     knowing that PGE is the counter-party to a transaction.  Again,
     this would not prevent EPMI from selling power to PGE at above-
     market prices.

          The Commission is not assured by the Applicants' proposal
     that transactions between PGE and EPMI conducted via EnronOnline
     will occur in a manner that is consistent with the Commission's
     expectations regarding transparent and reasonable prices for
     inter-affiliate power sales transactions.  There is, for example,
     no provision in the proposed amendments regarding how
     unaffiliated customers, or other interested parties, would
     monitor inter-affiliate transactions.

          For the above reasons, we will reject the proposed
     amendments, without prejudice to Applicants revising their
     proposal to address the Commission's concerns and incorporating
     appropriate restrictions to protect against affiliate abuse.







               11
                 Likewise, PGE might be willing to buy at lower prices and
          sell at higher prices.

Good morning Stan.  I am holding 11:00 - Noon on Wednesday for the building tour.  I think it would be okay to meet Jeff and Bill Donovan in the lobby.  Unfortunately Jeff will be leaving to go out of town right after lunch, so I don't think that the tour of the Hobby Performing Arts Center will work for Wednesday.

Thanks and have a great weekend.

Joannie,

Just a reminder about the job tour on Wednesday.  I will be in San Diego
until Tuesday night so I wanted to check in today.  I will be happy to come
to Jeff's office to pick him up or we can meet in the lobby. Just give me a
time and I'll set it up.  I will also be available to show him the Hobby
Performing Arts Center if he has time.

Subject: Protests of utility market-based rates

Summary of emails detailed below:

Dave Delainey and Kevin Presto have authorized Enron protests of utilities 
seeking to renew their market based rates for power sales.  Enron has already 
filed detailed protests against AEP, Entergy, and Southern Energy Marketing.  
We also plan to file a detailed protest of Hydro Quebec.

Protests of the following utilities will be very short (shown below) stating 
that FERC should condition the continuation of market based rates upon the 
utility joining a valid fully functioning RTO. ((Ameren, FP&L, LGE/KU, 
Cinergy, TXU, VEPCO, and Duke).  Protests will be due over the next few 
months.

Please let me know if you want to receive copies of the protests or drafts.

Subject: Re: market-based rate  

Kevin said this looks good w/ these changes:

2nd para;  "Commission an (NOT AND) Open-Access Transmission Tariff"
and last para:  Add after December 15, 2001 deadline  "or if a transmission 
owner does not join a fully functioning RTO that meets all of the 
Commission's requirements" 

This needs to get filed today, if possible, as a request for rehearing in 
Ameren Docket ER00-2687-001.  Note:  There were no interventions or protests 
in this docket and FERC issued a letter order accepting the filing on Nov. 
2.  What is odd and should be pointed out for why we are intervening at this 
time is that there may have been a problem with when or how the notice was 
issued.  Neither Nancy P. or our paralegal Jan saw this notice.  I found it 
after the intervention date.  It is certainly odd that there were no 
interventions in this at all.  One concern for Dan/Joe/Jim:  Since this is 
going in as a late intervention and request for rehearing, what is the 
likelihood of the Commission tossing the whole idea out quickly because of 
the late intervention, which may hurt our overall cause.

Next, this is the list of those utilities that we plan to file this pleading 
in (We are not protesting Xcel/NSP/Pub Serv of Co):

FP&L MAYBE Docket No. 97-3359-003 Protests due 11/20
Cinergy (due in Jan)
TXU (due in Jan)
VEPCO (due next Aug)
Duke (due next Dec)
LGE/KU (due next March)

NOTE:  Kevin wants to do a full blown assessment  against HQ , which is due 
sometime this Nov.  Please keep all eyes out. for the HQ filing.

You all should have Mary Hain's original analysis.  Bracewell Patterson has 
reviewed her analysis and agrees.  It looks to me like we may have some

crafting a response to Dave Germaine's letter.  I have been working with 
Ellen Banaghan from Tabors Caramanis and Associates -- I think we are close 
to boiling our rather technical explanation into a digestable story.  
Depending on how Greg's efforts set up meetings with Sladoje and Germaine, we 
should have a strategy call soon.

I've attached our comments on Mary's analysis of the PX's authority re: the 
Silver Peak Line investigation.  As you will see, we agree with Mary's 
analysis, subject to minor quibbles that do not affect the conclusion, that 
EPMI should not be found to have violated the literal terms of the PX's 
tariff, that the PX has no sanction authority over this matter, and that 
publication of the Compliance Unit's findings would be inappropriate.

We would, however, take a harder line on the proposed compromise.  In our 
view, we should insist that the PX never publicly link EPMI to the events of 
Mary 24-25.  Thus, we should agree to support a tariff filing by the PX to 
clean-up the loophole in its tariff revealed by these events, as long as the 
tariff filing does not mention either EPMI or these events as the basis for 
the filing.

Dave,

Attached is a  summary of our test efforts at New Albany.? The new 
combustion  system?performed as expected. We have taken orders from other 
users for the  EA version of the system and will be delivering the first sets 
at the end of the  1st Qtr. The new system would give you 3X the current run 
time at New Albany  & Doyle. Is there any interest in upgrading to the new 
system? I know we  have discussed it in the past.

Dear Dr. Lay,

We are looking forward to your participation at the upcoming "Markets
in Transition" symposium at Rice University on January 10, 2002.

Invitations to the event were sent approximately two weeks ago.  The
invitations listed the agenda and speakers.  We have completed
incorporating the biography and photograph that you provided into the
program brochure.

During the event, we have allocated 20 minutes, beginning at 1:40PM,
for your remarks on Markets in Transition.  We expect your remarks to
be broad in scope and to provide your views on how the economic and
market factors of recession, technology evolution, and heightened
security are impacting the business landscape.  Our hope is that your
remarks will be generic in nature -- Markets in Transition is a
concept that applies to virtually all industries.

We understand that you will make no reference to Enron.  Furthermore,
there will be no question and answer session after your presentation.
We will take measures to ensure that the press has no access to you
before or after your remarks.

Please return the speaker logistics form (requested separately) at
your earliest convenience.

We look forward to your participation.  Please contact me or Brad
Burke, Associate Director of the Rice Alliance (713-348-6136), if you
wish additional information.  Thank you.

Sincerely,

Steve Currall

Jeff,

Happy Easter!

A few years ago at the YPO Harvard University, I met a guy from Venezuela.
He and I have kept in contact through the years and we get together from
time to time.  We had dinner a few days ago and he asked me if I thought
you might be interested in meeting with Ali Rodgrigues.  Ali will be in the

Hello Jeff

A voice from the past.  Hope you are doing well.

I wanted to gain your assistance to point me to the most appropriate person
I could interview at Enron.  I am helping a client understand how companies
in the US Natural Gas and Power industry are coping with the challenges in
their industry in terms of developing and retaining the "right skills".
So, someone who could provide an external perspective of how players in the
industry are coping with the challenges as well as an internal perspective
on Enron would be great for me to interview.  If that means more than one
individual, that is fine too.

Hope this is not too much of an imposition.  I'll undertake the
conversation over the telephone and keep it short.

You can reach me on email: sgiridha@prismintl.com or on my cell phone:
240-603-6084.

Thanks a lot for your assistance.

Shyam Giridharadas

Jeff,

Judy Lay Allen, an associate of yours on the Federal Reserve board, spoke with Joannie Williamson today regarding my desire to interview at Enron.

I am a graduate of Princeton University with two years experience in financial modeling and communications.   Towards assessing my skill set relative to peers, I took and received a 740 on my GMAT.  I have also interned in a gas exploration company and am familiar with the industry; likewise, I have worked with clients in telecommunications and am aware of the work Enron is doing in the bandwidth trading/pooling field.

I am aware of Enron's executive training/business analyst programs and am highly interested in exploring opportunities therein.  I am in Houston through Friday evening and, given the short notice, would be grateful for any opportunity to meet with the appropriate person any time Thursday or Friday.

I look forward to interviewing and applying my experience at Enron.

Best regards,
Michael Kuntz

On 9/21, EPMI filed a protest (Below) against AEP/CSW's 3 year update request

examples of discriminatory behavior on OASIS (for ATCs, etc.) that 
potentially benefitted AEP's marketing side.

Subject: ISO To Participate in Super Peak Market



Folks,

Late Friday afternoon Ziad called me.  The ISO Governing Board earlier
the same day turned down the ISO management's request to force SCs to
place 95% of their scheduled load in the DA market.  That leaves the ISO
little choice but to venture into the energy markets to procure power to
cover their peak hours on hot days.

Terry gave Ziad the OK to proceed with placing both the APX and
California PX screens for this new product/matching-service.  I am
working with the two vendors and the ISO to make this happen quickly.
We anticipate that the market will open on Tuesday, September 5, or
earlier.

Key people who you may need to contact:
ISO - Ziad Alaywan  916-351-2140 (Nancy Traweek and Jim McIntosh are
also in the loop)
PX - Ken Czarnecki 626-537-3123
PX - John Yurkanin 626-537-3124
APX - Denice Cazalet 408-517-2123
APX - Michael Heinrich 408-517-2159

Please feel free to contact me with your questions.  Several of you have
not had the opportunity to attend the pre-design meetings we had at the
California PX and APX a few weeks ago, nor were you aware of the joint
WPTF/ISO meeting held last week.  But in essence, what this
product/matching-service will allow you to do is post bids to sell, or
buy a 6-hour block of capacity at a firm energy price across the hours
of HE13 to HE18.  You can bid at COB, Mead, PV, SP15 or NP15.  You can
utilize either the CalPX or APX to post your bids, because the ISO will
be watching both screens.  The block sizes are (supposed to be) 25MW.
The seller is responsible for arranging transmission to the delivery
point, and the buyer (e.g., ISO) is responsible for arranging
transmission service from the delivery point.  The ISO will make its
purchase decisions for the day-of at or before 8:00 a.m.  The ISO will
send out a general notice when it needs offers to sell on the super-peak
market.  I expect that bids for either buy or sell will be able to be
posted at any time, 24 hours.  The screens should allow parties to post
buy or sell bids at least 60 days forward of the trade day.

You are not limited to a price cap in these markets, but the ISO as a
buyer has the right to not purchase at prices above it's price cap.

I think WPTF members should be very proud that we were able to quickly
work together, and with the ISO to create this market. I have no doubt
the ISO will be offering bids to purchase starting Sept 5, and going
forward 60 days.  However, who among you will be willing and able to
post bids to sell?

gba

Subject: Re: PGE's '02 and beyond

Hi, Mitch!  As of today, Oregon is sill moving forward with our version of
open access.  As you may recall, this is a fairly consevative approach.  Only
non-residential customers are eligible for direct access.  Utilities need not
sell any generating resources.  We will use a technique called "ongoing
valuation" to allow non-residentials to elect other suppliers while still
receiving the benefits/paying the costs of our current supplies.  We are
planning to be in balance (or long) for 2002 on a full load basis.  Thus,
while non-residential customers may elect new suppliers, they are essentially
fully hedged with our portfolio of long- and short-term supplies.  We have
also begun to raise the question for discussion whether we should fill a full
load position for years beyond 2002.  Those discussions will probably continue
the next couple of months.  One possible outcome is that we would fill all of
our load except perhaps customers over 1-5 MWs.  They would have the right to
"opt-out" by giving us notice 1/1/02 not to plan for them beginning 1/1/03. 
Then, the Commission might phase in this option for consecutively smaller load
customers on a set schedule.  This would allow us some certainty and ability
to make longer-term commitments and also give the market some certainty about
what load might be available when.  Everyone is well-aware of our short
position and the implications of that.  We are seeking an amendment to
Oregon's restructuring law that would eliminate any date restriction on our
ability to treat resource commitments as eligible for transition treatment.  I
think this is a critical piece to ensuring that Oregon doesn't set up a cliff
like California did or Nevada appears to be doing.  All this being said,
whether Oregon's restructuring moves forward is ultimately an
emotional/political issue.  Bad news, even if unrelated to direct access,
could spook the Legislature enough to give momentum to the several bills
already introduced to delay/reverse it.  We will keep you informed. 
Meanwhile, our power supply folks are proceeding as if we will need to plan
for almost everyone indefinitely.

Jim, 

In the resource plan that you sent me earlier this week, you indicated that 
PGE was short anywhere from 400 to 700 MW, going out to 2006. What 
sentiment are you hearing in Oregon about open accesss? (In Nevada, where 
I have been focused of late, the drums are beating louder for longer 
delays). If open access (customer choice) is deferred beyond this year, 
how do you plan to cover this short position, especially in '02? Does the 
OPUC appreciate that you are short in anticipation of open access? 

Thanks,

Subject: On-sight Power Generation Reclamation Business Plan





I recently read articles about Enron Corporation in Fortune magazine  and 
Business Week, and was encouraged by your success in building a  flexible and 
innovative workforce. I admire this type of approach from a leader  of a 
large, multi-national company. 

Based on Enron,s initiatives to market and sell wholesale electricity, and  
the recent power shortages across various regions of the country, I was  
motivated to develop a business opportunity utilizing my experience and  
knowledge of the on-site power generation market. I realized that an 
unregulated  utility company could take advantage of existing, unused 
stand-by generator  capacity.

My plan sells the excess capacity of these generators in the spot energy  
market, when the on-site generators are commanded to power customer base 
loads,  thereby freeing up an equivalent amount of energy. My plan requires 
minimal  capital investment, produces a sales volume of $2.0M, and a net 
profit of  $400,000.00 in year one. The attached business plan and three-year 
pro forma P  & L statement provide further details.

I strongly believe this idea can and will provide a solid return on  
investment. My goal is to heighten your interest enough to warrant further  
discussion on the possibility of Enron integrating this business plan into 
its  existing network of marketing, trading and selling electricity.

I chose to market this plan to Enron due to its leadership in the 
deregulated  electricity market, and its corporate culture of innovation and 
swift action.  Enron also has the name recognition, resources and national 
presence required to  make this plan successful.

I look forward to hearing from you on the merit of my business plan, and the  
feasibility of integrating it into your company.

Thank you for your time.

Thank you to everyone who participated in the Portland employee volunteer interest survey - we appreciate your feedback.

While monetary and in-kind gifts are important, hands-on volunteers are the lifeblood of any community agency. At Enron, we recognize that we are all stakeholders when it comes to the success of our communities. Over the years, Enron employee volunteers have provided helping hands, intellectual capital and skilled labor to non-profit agencies. We hope that by identifying some volunteer opportunities that interest Portland employees we will not only have the experience of contributing to the Portland community, but also build stronger teams within our own organization. We also believe that everyone will have some fun!

For those who have not yet had time to answer the survey, we did extend the deadline for one more week. Please take a few minutes and let us know what you think about volunteer opportunities by clicking on the link below. If you have questions about the survey, please send an e-mail to community-relations@enron.com.

Thank you,

Chris Calger and Tim Belden

ENA also sold 100 MW of peak power (6x16) to PG&E for 5 years beginning in 
January of 2001 delivered in NP15.  They declined our offer for flat (7x24) 
power delivered in NP15 of $50.90/MWh.  The trade press is claiming that they 
purchased 400 MW from Calpine delivered in the new Greater Bay Area zone for 
around $51/MWh.  I believe that these values are lower than the current 
generation component of PG&E's frozen rates.

PG&E procured these MW's through a traditional rfp.  This is a pretty clean 
bilateral deal done outside of the PX.  We papered the deal using the EEI 
master agreement.

I am on-side with all your points.  On the New Albany retrofit, I want to

Subject: Houston Meeting


Dave,

Thank you for taking the time to discuss the issues and opportunities facing
our companies. I did not expect to have such an audience. I came seeking
business advice on the litigation and feel I accomplished a lot more. I
apologize for not contacting you directly, but I was unaware that you were
now responsible for all of the groups within ENA.   Congratulations !!!!!

Here is what I came away with:

Litigation
GE has proposed a settlement that includes a proposed press release
unacceptable to PSM. I have our attorneys working on drafting a response to
GE and pursing the possibility of eliminating the joint press release
altogether. If common ground cannot be reached we will pursue other legal
options.

Private Placement
The book has been released to Enron & Calpine. I understand your position
concerning participation and the question of the ongoing litigation. I am
very open to the additional warrant option. Mike Miller talked to me about
it after the meeting and we will discuss it next week.

New Albany Retrofit
I have asked my engineers to formulate a plan to upgrade the units at New
Albany with our latest 6 ppm liners and fuel nozzles. We are currently
manufacturing a full set for a 7EA machine. We haven't firmed up the test
dates but we need to seek approval by ENA & OEC to use one of the Doyle
machines. This is a significant leap in technology that many of our clients
are extremely interested in. We now have the only single digit dry low Nox
system that can be used on multiple machine types to include Westinghouse
501D5A, ABB 11 N1/N2, GE F6 / F7.

FT4 Mobile Unit
I understand from Mike Miller you want to slow the pace down on the first
ten units to "Learn out" the manufacturing and business process. This will
ease our pain level on schedule. My engineering staff is very excited with
this program because it involves aircraft engines and they can apply their
true skills. We just hired the program manager named George Kirsby. He is
currently in charge of the $4 billion Joint Strike Fighter engine design
program for Pratt Whitney / Boeing. I figure he should be able to manage the
mobile unit project. At some time in the near future I would like to arrange
a program presentation for you in Houston. I need to give Kirsby a few weeks
to get his arms around the project and will propose dates for you in the
future. We need to expedite the formation of the Joint Venture company as we
are already being approached with deals to place these units.

I really value your support and you can always count on our loyalty to
Enron.

Rod,

In the past, we have negotiated our audit fees with AA separate from Enron.  In addition, we are billed separate from Enron.  This is the time of year that I would plan on starting discussions with AA for 2001 audit fees.  Estimated fees for 2000 were approximately $1mm which includes statutory audits for certain entities in addition to the overall US GAAP audit.  

What is the policy/guideline under which we should proceed with AA?  Would Enron prefer to negotiate this in their overall discussion for the Enron audit and then allocate to Azurix an appropriate amount?

Thanks -- Kenny

Lexi Elliot,

Hi, my name is Judd Eisenberg, and I am a business student at the
University of Texas who is seeking the summer analyst internship at Enron.
I received an opportunity to meet you at a reception dinner that Enron
hosted last semester in Austin.  I have always been intrigued with the
analyst and associate rotational programs that Enron offers.  The courses I
take in school, accounting and particularly finance, my extensive job
experience, and my leadership positions have provided me with valuable
skills for the summer analyst position.  I have a good friend at UT who
will start working full-time for Enron in the IT division in a few months,
and I know he is truly looking forward to the challenges and opportunities
that Enron provides.  Because I am currently interning with
PricewaterhouseCoopers in Houston, I am not able to go through the
recruiting process at the university.  I am sending an attachment of my
resume in this e-mail since I am going to be in Houston until mid-March.
Please e-mail me if there are any openings for the position I am seeking or
if you have any questions. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Thanks,

Judd Eisenberg

September 13, 2000

Dear Mr. Bibi,

After giving more thought to our initial conversation, I have attached a
short document comparing Blacklight's (BLP) technology to fuel cell
technology.  BLP is developing a technology for the distributed electric
market.  We have prototypes under development, and the costs for our
technology compare favorably to the existing market.  The brochure will
elaborate on the advantages of our technology.

As we discussed, BLP is an R&D firm contacting companies that might have
complementary assets which would expedite the commercialization of our
technology.  As a result of our first discussion, I understand that Enron
might not be interested in new generation technology.  I wanted to provide
you with additional information on BLP.  If Enron's strategies change,
please contact me.  If you know other companies interested in investing or
joint developing a new generation technology, please let me know.  Thank you
for taking the time to review our materials.

Best Regards,

William Good

Subject: Peaker Fee

EE&CC has forwarded the peaker fee ($9.1 MM) invoice to ENA (see at bottom).  
I have sent a return e-mail to Gavin Gaul and John Normand explaining that 
final approval of this invoice will be from you.  Amy and I are waiting for a 
better breakdown of overhead charges on acceleration change orders.  Once we 
have the overhead issue framed out, I would then battle the fee, especially 
on Wilton Center, on a packaged basis with the overhead charges.

As per the Wilton Center fee, I reviewed all of the e-mail rhetoric regarding 
who is to blame for the massive construction cost overruns.  EECC/NEPCO's 
cupbability lies in their insistance from day one that Wilton Center could 
and would be built non-union.  It was only after ENA forced the decision in 
late June 1999 to build the job union (to avoid air permit intervention) that 
EECC/NEPCO even began to deal with how to build the job in a union 
environment.  Even at that point, EECC/NEPCO would not move off of building 
the job on a cost reimbursable basis and did not properly consider other 
alternatives such as fixed unit pricing (fixed price per unit quantity 
installed).  EECC/NEPCO claimed that they did not have enough time to 
negotiate with the unionsor pursue other options.  However, because of their 
insistance to go non-union, they precluded the ability to negotiate until the 
decision to go union was made.  According to our labor experts, breaking off 
union site negotiations and building non-union is worse than just going 
non-union from the start.  In any event, if you need more detail on this 
subject prior to discussing the fee with Larry Izzo, please let me know and I 
will summarize the key points.

I will continue to work with Amy Spoede to tie down the remaining cost and 
overhead issues.  If you need me to do anything else, please let me know.

Kevin,

How are things going?  Don't imagine you are too upset not having to deal 
with California or the wildfires out west?  Things are going well for us 
here, but as we expected it is like the US in 94/95 (things just starting) 
and Europe (96/97).  The Japanese utilities are not being too original in 
their approach... same playbook.  Regardless of all of this, looking at sites 
and potential development of physical trading assets is starting to look 
quite promising.  Jpnese cutting back on nuclear and significantly increasing 
LNG and many old oil-fired plants out there are just a few of the 
characteristics.

You mentioned in your last email that you had significantly reduced your 
efforts at adding capacity in the East.  Along these lines would you know of 
anyone that might be interested in a Japan tour to get all of this going?  
Ideally it would be someone at the Director level.  Let me know.

Joe

Subject: WPTF Friday Thin Quality Burrito



Hey Burrito Heads!  It's just another fascinating week in Burrito land.
I spent the better part of this week learning something new, which at my
age is not easy.  In fact, just about everything at my age is getting
more difficult.  But I wont  bore you with the details.  The new thing I
learned was how to be an Examiner on the Board of Examiners for this
year's California Governor's Quality Education and Development Award
(CalQED).  Its an annual shindig for companies, health care
institutions, and schools to compete for the honor of shaking the Gov's
hand, and hearing that your (pick one: company, non-profit, school,
health care institution) are world class.  Being an examiner of the
written applications, and working with a team of peer examiners is all
pro bono on my part.  I am wondering what the hell I got myself into.
I'll tell you more about it some other time.

Speaking of world class, I got two top notch letters this week that I
want to share with you.  One from Ken Lackey of Edison Mission Marketing
and Trading, regarding the May 25 overscheduling on the Silver Peak
intertie by 2900 MW (see Lori Eckman's note to me in last week's
Burrito), and a reply to Ken's letter from George Sladoje, CEO of the
PX.

Ken, who I have known for several years, is a person who doesn't speak
out unless something really bothers him. Ken wrote:

"Since Day 1, I've always wondered what mechanism was in place to
protect against this scenario [overscheduling on an intertie], or if
this scenario would be regarded as a market implementation flaw or
"feature".  I always figured it was a feature, simply because I didn't
think that a hole this large would be unintentionally overlooked.  I
also figured that this feature was available for use by market
participants and that if it became overused, that it would eventually
come under scrutiny by the market compliance police.  I also wondered if
people could use this to change spreads in such a way as to improve
their overall positions.  I also figured that for the most part there is
no such thing as "artificially" high prices since  in my opinion the
market design itself is somewhat artificial.   But now I know the
truth..it's a flaw, it was overlooked and there is no
protection...amazing.

"I certainly do not agree with [George] Sladoje's interpretation of the
PX tariff (that overscheduling across a path constitutes improper
implementation of a generator schedule, which therefore constitutes a
violation of the tariff).   Also I believe that it is completely
inappropriate for the burden of proper functioning of the market to rest
on the shoulders of the market participants (i.e. if someone types in an
incorrect schedule in their PX Trade Application, the market should not
blowup) .  The responsibility of a properly functioning market lies with
the market operator (PX) itself.  PX software should validate that the
proper mechanics have been used by the market participants.

"By the way, it wasn't us who caused this situation, and of course we
would prefer to pay low PX energy prices rather than high, but if we
review this situation and retroactively recreate prices, then perhaps
all other cases in which congestion at tie-points caused high prices
should also be reviewed to see if they are "real".

"By the way, typically, I would not respond to this sort of thing due to
time constraints, however, some of our recent involvement in other
ISO/PXs has highlighted the contrasts between California and other
ISO/PXs.  Each of them, including California, has its strengths and
weaknesses, however, it's in California where the unusual is the norm."

I sent Ken's letter to George, and his staff at the PX, and George wrote
back the following:

"Because the incident of May 25 is the subject of an official
investigation by the PX Compliance unit, I cannot comment on the
specifics of this matter at this time.  It is likely that the CalPX
Market Monitoring Committee will be involved in the investigation and
the results will likely be presented to the CalPX Board of Governors.
As to the issue of a design flow in the overall California marketplace
--- we are currently reviewing this issue and have requested that the
ISO do the same.

"I disagree with the assertion that CalPX Tariff provision 3.3.2 does
not apply here.  In all major exchange operations the institution not
only provides a forum for trading, but also monitors the activities of
its members, both currently and after the fact.  The participants are
expected to follow the rules.  At one of my previous employers, as an
example, (the Chicago Board of Trade), a suspected abuse or a compliant
from another member or customer results in an investigation by the
Office of Investigations and Audits (the counterpart of CalPX's
Compliance unit).  Depending on the nature of the issue, the
investigation results are presented to the Floor Governors Committee,
Business Conduct Committee or the Financial Compliance Committee.  These
bodies then determine if additional investigation is warranted and if
the issue requires Board of Director action.

"Similarly, the CalPX has the obligation to investigate and take actions
against participants who violate tariff provisions.  Our recently filed
sanction's protocol formalizes the process further and describes a
series of penalties which can be imposed.  Therefore, we believe our
tariff does provide adequate protection.

"Finally, as to whether a comparable event has occurred in the past ---
this will be part of the investigation process and a review of market
design.  Obviously, impact schedule submissions above ATC limits have
happened as a result of free and open markets.  Congestion has become an
almost regular occurrence.  The real issues under investigation in this
incident are magnitude, intent and materiality of impact on our
marketplace."

Thank you, both Ken and George for those comments.  I am sure we will
hear from other members on the issue.  Lori, don't be silent.  You
started this thing.

====================================

Speaking of market design (segues, I am very big on segues this week),
old warrior, dear friend,  and defender of the just, Carl Imparato had a
few things to say about the ISO's proposed utilization of ex post GMMs.
Carl wrote:

"Yesterday, [the ISO Market Analysis Unit] stated that not implementing
after-the-fact GMMs would be a departure from the original vision of the
California market structure.

"Ex post GMMs were NOT a part of the market structure.  When I was at
PG&E and we were developing the tariff in early 1997, no one (not at
PG&E, SCE or any other market participant, to my knowledge) ever
advocated ex post GMMs, and they were NOT included in the tariff.   I
don't recall the words "state estimator" (for calculation such GMMs)
ever being uttered by anyone in a WEPEX stakeholder meeting.

"It was only somewhere in mid-1997, when Alex was working on UFE
equations, that Alex (I believe) suddenly came up with the proposal for
ex post GMMs, and the proposal was taken by ISO very quickly (before it
had ANY discussion in SCUG or any other forum), and was adopted by the
ISO Board (or whatever group passed for the Board at that time).
Immediately thereafter, virtually everyone in SCUG .  We were ignored.

"But even in early 1998, we informally agreed that, in light of the
facts (that after-the-fact GMMs were not part of the original "deal"),
after-the-fact GMM implementation would be given low priority and we
would be given opportunity to discuss this issue before ISO moved
forward."

I remember those discussions, Carl.  I wonder if deals made in 1998 have
any meaning today?

==================

The SCE Pilot Forwards Program, a continuing saga for WPTF,  popped up
again this week.  I visited with Commissioner Bilas on Monday to
encourage him to stay the course, and support the ALJ's preliminary
decision to reject SCE's Application, and cancel the hearings on legal
and procedural grounds.  Dick said that he supported that notion, but he
couldn't guarantee that all his colleagues would.

Alas, two days later, Commissioner Joe Neeper, who clearly had too much
time on his hands this week, issued a public statement which is long,
but here is a taste:

"ALJ Hale's Proposed Decision (PD) is structured so that a "Yes" vote
will terminate the proceeding and a "No" vote will continue the
proceeding to hearings and ultimate resolution.;; I have concerns with
the PD.; However, I do not intend to issue an alternate because, should
my concerns not be addressed, I have the option to vote "No" which would
have the same effect as the alternate I otherwise would have written....

"If we vote to allow this application to move to hearings, we can later
determine whether the Application should be approved on overall policy
grounds.  The PD dismisses the Application on the grounds that does not
comply with what is known as the buy/sell requirement for utilities to
sell all of their generation into, and purchase all of their energy
needs for their bundled customers out of, the PX.; I agree with the ALJ
and the Assigned Commissioner that the Application also must be
compatible with the buy-sell requirement in order to be approved, and
that this threshold decision is therefore necessary.....

"The PD concludes that the Application makes SCE's customers more
vulnerable to market power abuse.;In viewing the comments of parties, I
find the concern about market power abuse to be expressed best by
Western Power Trading Forum (WPTF) in its opening brief.; WPTF states on
page 7 that, under SCE's proposal, "ESPs will no longer be able to
compete with utilities on the basis of short-run incremental costs in an
open setting" as envisioned by the PPD.;Thus, "ESPs would find it
increasingly more difficult to compete with an Edison price which was
neither derived from a transparent PX price nor reflective of the retail
market in which ESPs must participate."  ... The PX price is determined
in an open setting, and would continue to be determined in an open
setting under SCE's proposal....I cannot find that the proposal would
violate the PPD by necessarily leading to abuse of market power.  Market
power concerns should be considered, and weighed against consumer and
other interests.; These issues certainly can be explored in greater
depth as policy matters in hearings.

"I do not believe the Application by SCE is in violation of the
Commission's Preferred Policy Decision.; The merits of the Application
should be considered through the hearing process and voted upon by the
Commissioners. "

Well, Mr Neeper, justice isn't free.  A hearing is expensive, and what
your are doing is raising the ante of staying in the
game,unnecessarily.  That supports the incumbents (UDCs), and hurts us.

At the time I am writing this Burrito, I do not know if the Commission
took action on this matter today, or punted it to the July 8 meeting.
I'll keep you posted, next week.

==================

I am sure most of you have seen the press releases which came out last
week.  First, Dynegy and Illinova are merging, and, second, NEV is being
purchased by AES.  Both Dynegy and NEV are Voting members of WPTF.  I
was going to send Illinova a solicitation letter to join WPTF, but now I
think I'll take that off my "to do"list.

In the NEV deal, the AES Corporation announced that it  has entered into
a definitive agreement to acquire New Energy Ventures  in a transaction
valued at approximately $90 million. AES will acquire all of the
outstanding shares of New  Energy Ventures from its current owners,
UniSource Energy Corporation. and New Energy Holdings, L.L.C. (which is
owned by senior  management of New Energy Ventures).

This is an incredible coincidence.  I was just telling someone, I think
it was Dan Douglass, that we ought to give a special award to Nancy Day
of NEV, who is a big fan of the Burrito, and quite possibly, although I
am not certain, one of the senior managers of that lucky corporation.
Well, heck, she has been at NEV from the beginning, so she deserves all
the financial success in the world, and we wish her well.   I just want
to share with all our Burrito readers that WPTF, a tax-exempt,
non-profit corporation, Tax ID 94-3296987, right here in the State of
California, soon to be a CalQED award winner, is looking for donors for
the soon-to-be-announced Executive Director's fund.  Some of you might
not know about this new [slush] fund. It is intended to provide all the
necessary tools and ancillary needs of late night policy pow wows
attended by the usual wonks and otherwise homeless lobbyists who invade
my private hotel room during the WPTF general meeting, and who want to
discuss high level stuff all through the night.  What's an executive
director to do?  So, Nancy, I was just thinking, we could launch this
program in your honor, with your name all over the thing, and get this
very important and much needed program in place.  At least it will pay
for a hotel room for Curtis who consistently falls asleep during these
meetings on my hotel-room couch while Beth Emery is lecturing him.

By the way, if, God forbid, the deal falls through, then forget I wrote
all this.

Have a great weekend.  Think quality.

David:

I met with you last December/January in connection with working for Enron.
At that time Enron made me an offer to work in your group.  I made the
decision to not accept the offer.  The main reason was that I could not
digest the concept of leaving BP Amoco less than six months after I had
joined them.

I am still with BP Amoco and they continue to treat me real well.  At the
same time, I now realize that I made  a stupid mistake in turning down the
Enron offer.  If you are willing to reconsider, I would love to talk to you.
Considering what I put you through the last time, if you do not want to
reconsider, I can understand.

David, I would appreciate it I can meet with you in person to discuss this
further with you.  If you are okay with it, can I buy you lunch and talk
about this.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Sir,
I read your note with great deal of interest and care.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that this email was devoid of any stereotypical remarks that are so prevalent in the mass media today.

Unfortunately, such is not the case with other communications being sent out on behalf of Enron Corp.  A case in point is the corporate security email, titled 'Travel Security Update', that was send out yesterday.  In this email, reaction to possible U.S. military retaliation has been tied to extremist Islamic violence.  Truth of the matter is that any reaction to the U.S. military action could be because of extreme nationalism, most likely to the be the case, or even extreme regionalism.  References to Islam, extremism, and violence, in the manner used in the security communication only perpetuates the stereotypes.

I would like for you and my co-workers at Enron to know that MUSLIMS DO NOT HATE AMERICANS (regardless of what Frank Graham wants to believe).  Muslims do have deep-rooted disagreements and distrusts of the American foreign policy but that in no way translates to what the mass media  would have us believe.

thanks

As you know, the U.S. government is investigating hundreds, if not thousands, of relatives, acquaintances and associates of the individuals who may have been involved in the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11.  We believe that the media will soon be reporting that one of the many individuals being questioned is an Enron employee in Houston.  It is appropriate for us to withhold judgment and to continue to cooperate fully with federal authorities.  Because this is a matter in the hands of the federal authorities, we cannot provide additional information at this time.   However, we will keep you informed, to the greatest extent possible. 

Please keep in mind that thousands of people who may or may not have any information about the terrorist attacks are being questioned as part of this investigation.  We continue to have every reason to believe that our employees and facilities are safe.  If you have concerns, please call Corporate Security at (713) 345-2804.  If you receive any media or external inquiries about this matter, please call Public Relations at (713) 853-5670.

At Enron, diversity is one of our strengths, and we respect and embrace all people of all faiths and beliefs.  Please continue to keep our employees who have been impacted by this tragedy in your thoughts and prayers.

Eric
?
Here are the main questions I would like to pose to Tim.  Beyond these 
specifics, I would like to know how he thinks the California  situation has 
affected energy trading in general. Please let me know if you or  he would 
like more information.
?
Thanks for your help -
Dwight
?
1) How have energy trading contracts held up under the stress of  the 
California crisis?
2) Does Enron use its own contract, or does it use the  EEI-NEM master 
agreement?
3) Have traders changed any provisions in the contracts, or added clauses, to 
better deal with the market,s price volatility or increased  credit risk? 
4) Last year there was concern over the adequacy of trading contracts after  
Cinergy,s force majeure claim. Is there similar concern in California?
5) Are the remedies for failure to deliver or supply adequate? 
6) Is the market now comfortable with the definition of force majeure?
7) Do you feel the contracts adequately protect energy trading concerns from  
lawsuits and/or regulatory (e.g., FERC or PUC) interference in California?
8) Has the very high level of price volatility caused the firm to change how 
it  hedges its own trading inventory? How important is it in this environment 
to own  physical supply?
9) Has the high level of counterparty credit risk (e.g., PG&E) caused your  
firm to change its credit risk policies or hedging strategies?
10) Does having a  sophisticated credit risk trading entity (Enron Credit) 
under the Enron umbrella  help the energy trading desk deal with counterparty 
credit  issues?

Carl has been working with Enron and others and the ISO to develop a model 
that works for CA as well as for the Desert Southwest (which the ISO would 
then operate).  I think this summary explains the kinds of things were trying 
to get in congestion management reform.  I'll send a few other things to look 
at.

Subject: CAISO Congestion Model

Ziad:

Per our conversation this morning, attached is a summary of what I view to be 
the key attributes of a "reformed" zonal congestion model.  The document does 
not fully address all of the issues discussed at last Thursday's congestion 
reform meeting in Sacramento, but I believe that (other than for some 
details) it is consistent with what both the ISO and many of the market 
participants are proposing.

This summary does not necessarily reflect the views of my clients, who 
haven't yet had the time to review it... but I don't believe that it would be 
too far off.  

I am sending this summary to you to put into context the many comments that I 
offered at last Thursday's meeting and also to support my view that, if the 
ISO were to implement the CONG/ASM integration by DECENTRALIZING the process 
rather than CENTRALIZING the process, there would not be much difference 
between what I've been advocating in the Southwest and the CAISO's model.  
(The primary remaining differences would be: (i) the way the "hour-ahead" 
process works - i.e., continuously vs. one discrete time; and (ii) the way 
scheduling is done - i.e., the ISO would not act as the SC's representative 
in acquiring rights that could be made available through inter-zonal 
counterflows since the SCs would do this themselves.)  So there is a real 
possibility that, with some agreement on the ISO's longer-term plans (whether 
integration of transmission rights and ancillary services procurement will 
rely on decentralization vs. centralization), we could bring together the 
models for the region.  

Carl

[Sue, Curt, Jim, Gary, Alex, Kent, Steven, John and Barney: I'd appreciate 
any feedback... but if you want me to see it, be sure to send it to 
cfi1@tca-us.com, NOT the enron address from which this e-mail was sent.

Dave-

Thank you for taking the time last week to speak at the floor meeting on 29.
I come from an engineering background and work in a financial reporting role 
for Andrea Reed.
I have found the transition from engineering to finance at Enron a natural 
one with my eye on details and
the analysis process.

I have attached Gwen Weddington's resume which I would like to pass on to the 
Fundamentals Group for the Gas Business,
which you mentioned is now being formed.
I think that she could be a valuable addition to Enron.
She is currently an Operations Manager at Air Products and Chemicals' 
Industrial Chemicals Group.

Can you tell me to whom I should forward this?

Thanks,

Carol
3-4291

Carol Marshall
Enron
Houston, TX

Dear Carol:

I appreciated the opportunity to speak with you on Friday.  As I mentioned,
I am pursuing other opportunities outside of my current position with Air
Products and Chemicals and have been intrigued with the things I have read
about Enron.  Also, part of my strategy is contacting a few friends who
might be kind enough to "keep their eyes open" and share thoughts and ideas
as to companies I should contact.

I was hoping that you might take a moment to review the enclosed resume.  As
you can see, I would like to find a position which will utilize my strong
operations background.  I would certainly enjoy another position as an
Operations Manager, but would be open to exploring new industries as well.
I am confident my strengths are applicable within a broad range of
industries.  Your suggestions and ideas as to companies to contact would be
very encouraging.  I am open to any avenues you suggest.

Additionally, I am interested in expanding my circle of acquaintances.  It
seems that you may, possibly, be able to provide me with a few select
introductions.  Any names of individuals who might be of help to me, or who
can direct me to others, would be greatly appreciated.  The more contacts I
make, the more opportunities I can uncover.

If you have any thoughts or ideas please jot them down.  I will contact you
again in a few weeks to discuss your ideas.  Thank you in advance for your
help.

Sincerely,


Gwen Weddington

UPDATE OF CALIFORNIA CRISIS AND BRIEF NOTES ON DUKE ENERGY CONFERENCE CALL
PRUDENTIAL SECURITIES                                   January 12, 2001

SUBJECT: Natural Gas Distr./Pipelines

----- ANALYST(S) --------------------          -------- OPINION --------
M. Carol Coale   713.650.4732                 Current: Strong Buy
David R. Tameron   713.650.4731                  Risk: Moderate

----- HIGHLIGHTS---------------------------------------------------------
Key players in California energy crisis meeting continuing to meet in 
Washington
  - nothing material has yet to be finalized.  Our expectations are detailed
within.
1)   Cautioning investors to avoid stocks with California exposure until a 
more
longer term solution is decided upon.  However, the lowest risk is likely in 
the
cheapest stocks, and DUK may be the best bet over the week or so.  DYN in the
mid-$30s and ENE in the mid-$60s are also attractive.
2)   Duke Energy conference call reiterated that about 90% of California
portfolio is hedged forward with non-utilities or in transactions outside of 
the
Independent System Operator (ISO) or Power Exchange (PX).  We estimate Duke's
financial exposure is less than $0.04 per share annually.

-----
DISCUSSION---------------------------------------------------------Thoughts on
California and brief comments on the Duke Energy Conference Call.  Key
representatives of the California utilities, power generators, marketers have
been in meetings in Washington D.C. with the FERC Chairman, Secretary of 
Energy,
U.S. Treasurer and members of the Clinton staff.  We have the following
comments on what we believe may be and should be long-term solutions to the
California energy crisis.

What we think will come out of Washington meetings:
1)   Power generators will agree to selling power under long-term (up to 10
year) contracts at the capped retail rates ($65-$75/Megawatt hour (MWh) 
assuming
that they can buy gas supply forward.  However that market is very illiquid 
and
can take weeks to secure a transaction.
2)   Politicians/legislators want to avoid bankruptcies, but we still think
there is a 50/50 probability.
3)   Utilities likely to be able to buy/sell electricity in forward market.
4)   California is likely to eliminate the Power Exchange (PX) and replace 
with
negotiated buy/sell market.
5)   "Forbearance" brings up issues of whether the utility can defer payments
for power supply for a number of periods or whether the state will pick up the
bills.  The impact on the receivables of the power generators/marketers and
lenders is uncertain.
6)   We believe actual seizure of power plants from the unregulated suppliers 
by
the state is unlikely, as is the removal of emissions credits (also, we
understand NOx emissions credits can be as high as $46/Megawatt hour in
California).
7)   Resignation of reigning FERC Commissioner Jim Hoecker on 1/18/01 allows 
for
Bush-appointed commissioner to step in, most likely to be Republican Curt
Hebert.  Herbert has been vehemently opposed to price caps and supports
competitive markets.
8)   Under a "new FERC", we think there is a low risk of retroactive
repercussions on generators to "give back" past profits on electricity sold in
California last summer, and also that a windfall profits tax on
generators/marketers is unlikely.
9)   Companies such as DUK, DYN and ENE all appear to have less than $0.05 per
share of annual earnings exposure to California generation/marketing sales net
of risk mitigation.  However, recent conversations with Reliant Energy have
revealed that it has not hedged its receivables risk with the utilities in
California.  Typical monthly receivable balances range from $5-$270 million or
up to $0.60 of earnings exposure.  REI is betting on the risk of bankruptcy of
PG&E and Edison is unlikely, and therefore, the cost to set of credit reserves
at this point would more than outweigh potential earnings exposure.
10)  While these stocks, in addition to REI, appear oversold, the stock
performance is likely to be volatile until a solution to the CA energy crisis 
is
introduced. In our view, the California market solutions fall short of the big
picture.  I have been cautioning investors to avoid the above-mentioned stocks
until a more longer-term solution is decided upon.  However, the lowest risk 
is
likely in the cheapest stocks, and DUK may be the best bet over the week or 
so.
Still, DYN in the mid-$30s and ENE in the mid-$60s are also attractive, in our
view.
11)  We expect DYN, DUK, ENE and REI to all report positive 4Q01 earnings
surprises of at least a penny or so, but to the extent that the surprise is
related to power generation, the stocks may not react favorably.

What we think will solve the California problem:
1)   Eliminate all retail rate freezes, and let the market forces balance 
supply
and demand.  Higher electricity prices to the consumer will encourage less use
and the purchase of more efficient energy equipment, and will also encourage
independent generators to build new facilities.
2)   We agree with the allowance of forward sales and a free spot market for
unregulated electricity transactions.
3)   A word on the hydroelectric generators.  Most are government-owned
facilities that virtually generate electricity for "free".  It would stand to
reason that the hydroelectric generators (a.k.a. the federal government) has
been financial benefiting from selling "free" power into a market that has 
been
marginally priced off of high-priced natural gas.  Shouldn't the government 
also
be asked to "share the pain"?

Following highlights from DUK call:
1)   Duke controls or owns 3,300 megawatts of electric generating capacity out
of a portfolio of about 6,000 megawatts.  About 90% of its California 
portfolio
is hedged forward with third parties that are not utilities or in transactions
involving the Independent System Operator or Power Exchange.
2)   Duke's receivables "at risk" are not material financially or 
operationally,
according to the company.  Duke pointed out that just over 10% of EBIT is
generated from its wholesale energy business, although we estimate it is 
closer
to 15%.
3)   Duke has a minimal number of contracts with PG&E and SoCal Ed (EIX
subsidiary).
4)   Nothing material has been agreed upon in the Washington meetings between
industry representatives, legislators and feds, but the likelihood of power
plant seizures and retroactive penalties appear unlikely.
5)   We estimate DUK's annual financial exposure, net of forward sales, is 
less
than $0.04 per share annually.

Hertzberg (speaker of the CA Assembly) called a meeting yesterday afternoon 
of the group of market participants that have been negotiating the 
"core/noncore" proposal in California.  The purpose of the meeting was to 
brief us on their activities and their gameplan for trying to find a solution 
for California.  Here's a summary of the meeting.  Please keep confidential.

Work will be done over the weekend to put the core/noncore proposal in 
legislative language.  (We will be in the room.)
Work done by the "Plan B" group in the Assembly (Joe Dutra and Joe Nation) 
will also be put into legislative language over the weekend.
Because no proposal is "comprehensive," a complete legislative package will 
be created from the various pieces that have been worked on thus far (i.e., 
core/noncore, "Plan B," Edison MOU)
In addition, there are Republican demands that Hertzberg will need to address 
(e.g., end the litigation) in order to achieve bi-partison support, which is 
what Hertzberg's shooting for. 
To move the legislation, the plan is to establish a "conference committee," 
comprised of an equal number of Democrats and Republicans.
The committe would begin work on Monday and would attempt to finish putting a 
comprehensive bill together, vote it out of the Legislature and send it to 
the Governor for signing by Monday, July 16th.
July 16th is the deadline because that is the date that the PUC will issue 
its proposed decision regarding, among other things, how DWR's revenue 
requirement will be put into rates, whether Direct Access needs to be 
suspended, etc.
The PUC is issuing the draft on the 16th in order to give everyone 30 days to 
review and comment before the Commission votes on a final order on August 
15th.  (The PUC will actually issue a "thought piece" on Monday the 9th and 
will use reactions to the "thought piece" to craft the develop the proposed 
decision it plans to issue on the 16th.)
All of this is still up in the air, however.  As of right now, the leader of 
the Senate (Burton) has not agreed to Hertzberg's gameplan and the 
Republicans, while interested, have not yet committed to join the process.

I will be heading out to Macerich's offices to meet Macerich's management team. At that meeting, we will be discussing the outsource and the future relationship between the companies.  He would also like me to speak to his direct reports about change management and other cultural characteristics of Enron.  However, he would really like you to provide a presentation on the same general topics to the Macerich Company Conference in June.  He has heard you speak and believes your approach and perspective can benefit the conference.

Obviously, these guys are an important relationship and reference for our commercial and real estate business.

Angela - thanks for making time to have dinner with us on Wednesday:  it
was great to see you.

As Art mentioned, since the time we have started working with you, we have
made frequent references to our operating teams about Enron's
accomplishments in the areas of customer excellence and employee
satisfaction.  More generally, we've held Enron out as an example of a
highly accomplished company in all the areas Macerich is currently focusing
on as an organization (operational integration, customer orientation,
scalability, change leadership, and strategic focus).

All of that being said, we would be extremely appreciative of an
opportunity to have either Jeff Skilling or Dave Delainey speak at either
of these conferences.  In any event, we're delighted that you would make an
effort to see if this can be put together.

Relative to upcoming Macerich events, there are two scheduled:

(1) University of Notre Dame Executive Education Program, May 7 - 9 in
South Bend.  The curriculum is centered on change leadership and strategic
thinking (officially "Enhanced Leadership and Strategy in the New
Economy").  Attendees include our Executive Team (Art, David, Rick,Tom, Ed,
and Larry Sidwell) and our Operating Team (17 SVPs).  There is also a
round-table discussion scheduled with our Board on May 9.

(2) Macerich's Company Conference, June 4 - 7 in Park Cities, Utah.  The
emphasis of the conference will be on our "e-Business Transformation" (more
specifically on becoming wholly integrated across functional roles,
customer facing, and highly scalable) and capturing value in our "Value
Network" (relationships we have with retailers, partners, vendors,
shoppers, etc.)  The attendees for this event include the same people at
UND as well as our managerial professionals from the malls and our
corporate offices (about 250 people, total).

Let me know if you need any additional background or information.

Eric

University of California, California State University and Enron Reach Settlement Agreement 

ATTENTION: State, Business editors 

OAKLAND, Calif., July 11 (AScribe News) -- The University of California, California State University and Enron Energy Services announced today a settlement agreement that will extend their contract for two years and return the two university systems to direct access service from Enron.

As part of the agreement, UC and the CSU will drop their lawsuit against Enron and Enron will dismiss its appeal. The two university systems had brought suit in federal court seeking to retain their status as direct access Enron customers after Enron had resourced their power procurement to the Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas&Electric utility companies.

"We are delighted that our negotiations with Enron have ended with retention of the two university systems as direct access Enron customers," said Joseph P. Mullinix, UC senior vice president for business and finance.

"The California State University is pleased that we have been able to resolve our differences with Enron and retain our direct access status," said Richard P. West, CSU executive vice chancellor and chief financial officer. "This agreement means considerable savings for the universities and allows us to continue with our energy conservation efforts."

"Enron has always been a strong advocate of the benefits of direct access, and we are pleased to be able to extend our contract for two years with UC/CSU," said Marty Sunde, vice chairman, Enron Energy Services.

"Separately, with the potential elimination of direct access for California customers, Enron is once again directly serving its commercial customers in California, including UC and CSU. As more and more customers in California see the importance of managing their price risk in power markets, commercial energy users have increased interest in our product offerings."

The current four-year contract with Enron is scheduled to end on March 31, 2002. The two-year extension, approved in principle, would continue the two university systems as direct access Enron customers until March 31, 2004.

Enron and the universities will negotiate price and other terms of the extension between now and Dec. 1, 2001. Both parties have the right to terminate the extension if an agreement is not reached by Dec. 1.

The agreement covers all UC campuses and the UC Office of the President, with the exception of UCLA and UC Riverside, which have agreements with their local municipalities. All CSU campuses, except Los Angeles, Northridge, Sacramento and Stanislaus, are part of the Enron contract, as is the CSU Office of the Chancellor.

Together, UC and CSU rank as the largest single user of electricity in California. UC's systemwide peak load is 332 megawatts, and CSU's is 117 megawatts. One megawatt powers approximately 1,000 homes.

Dear Pam:

Thank you for your e-mail of August 15th.  It is always a pleasure to hear from former employees.  Thank you also for calling attention to instances which, on the surface, do not appear to be representative of our expectations of Enron leadership.

Part of our continuous improvement involves an on-going review of our management and the diversity of styles therein.  True, not everyone is agreeable to Enron's culture or the many different management styles at Enron.  We do, however, expect all of our employees - not just management - to adhere to our core values of respect, integrity, communication and excellence.  These values become even more significant as we continue to grow and expand our scope of business, and more critical as we become a more culturally diverse workforce.

We enjoy our status as one of the best places in America to work according to Fortune and other sources thanks in part to our willingness to examine our organization and make needed change.  Our employee surveys, belief in open communication, and exit interview process for employees choosing to leave Enron are examples of our efforts to seek out feedback and scrutinize the way we do business.  Your feedback will help play a role in that process.

Sincerely,

Ken Lay

Mr. Lay:

Mr. Lay, the I am not writing this in malice but in hopes that it helps get
Enron back the way it used to treat their employees and makes it the number
one employer of choice again.  I hope you can get back the feeling that I
had when I first started there and get the stress level down in your
organization for the sake of your employees.

I am a former employee who worked at Enron for 10 years - my husband was,
at one time, in charge of A/P.  My one big disappointment was that I never
got to meet you.    During that time, I made a lot of friends who I
continue to see from time to time.  I left last year and have missed the
company since I left but would not contemplate coming back unless several
people have been replaced.  (Joannie Williamson and Sheri Sera know my
story.)

I "knew" Jeff but I don't think he knew me by name, only by sight, even
though I worked in ENA when it only had 400 employees with 3 of us in HR.
He was NOT what I would call a people person!  Unless you were in an upper
level position, he did not take the time to find out your name.  (Ron Burns
is still one of my favorite people because of his talent with people - we
need more like him in the business world!)

As you can see, I am now working for a competitor and since I work in HR, I
continually run into former Enron workers who have also left - most of
their reasons are the same.

It is not that they have lost faith in Enron as a company but because of
they way they were treated by their managers.  During the last 5 years I
was there, I noticed a change in direction in the way employees were
treated by upper management - and upper management was getting away with
it.  Not only were they getting away with it, these people were being
rewarded for this behavior.  I have heard stories of lower level employees
being screamed at and in one instance, one of the VP's who was brought down
from Canada was heard in his office screaming and pounding his telephone on
his desk.  Heaven only knows how he treats his subordinates.  Believe me,
the way employees are treated at Enron is being talked about on the streets
of Houston and on the different college campuses.  You might also at some
point take the time to find out why so many good people have left the HR
community at Enron and it is not because they wanted to.

I don't know if you will see this, but I hope so.  Good luck on bringing
Enron back to way it was - I still own stock!!

Thanks for listening...

Pam Allison

Jeff, 

I will be heading out to Macerich's offices to meet Macerich's management team. At that meeting, we will be discussing the outsource and the future relationship between the companies.  He would also like me to speak to his direct reports about change management and other cultural characteristics of Enron.  However, he would really like you to provide a presentation on the same general topics to the Macerich Company Conference in June.  He has heard you speak and believes your approach and perspective can benefit the conference.

Obviously, these guys are an important relationship and reference for our commercial and real estate business.

Let me know your interest.

Regards

PRUDENTIAL SECURITIES                                   October 27, 2000

SUBJECT: Electric Utilities

M. Carol Coale   713.650-4732                 Current:Accumulate
David R. Tameron 713.650-4731                 Risk:--



----- HIGHLIGHTS---------------------------------------------------------
1)   On October 26, FERC Commissioner Curt Hebert spoke on "Competition &
America's Energy Policy" to group of Houston industry executives, addressing 
the
merits and problems with electricity deregulation.
2)   Commissioner Hebert, the sole Republican, supports a comprehensive energy
policy, renewable fuel use, improved pipeline certification, and flexibility,
but opposes price controls and free market intervention.
3)   Last week, the California ISO called on the FERC to rule on a "market
stabilization plan" that would affectively cap the price electricity at 
$100/mWh
unless 70% of the power generated is sold forward within the state.
4)   FERC is expected to address this issue on 11/1, but we do not expect much
involvement until after the presidential elections, particularly given that 
the
FERC Commissioners are Presidential appointees.
5)   While we believe FERC's role in the electricity market problems in
California will be limited, any action taken is likely to be "bold, ambitious
and strict", requiring results, but likely would not affect 2001.

----- DISCUSSION---------------------------------------------------------
Energy is one of the leading topics in the approaching general elections and
congressional races, and spiking energy prices have been an area of 
contention.
Regional shortages have resulted in spikes in the price of electricity, and
this past summer, hot weather in the western U.S. sent electricity prices
soaring.  In California, where the rate payers served by PG&E and Edison
International are protected under a rate freeze, the higher power costs cannot
be passed on by the electric utilities to the consumer.  In southern 
California,
the situation is just the opposite.  Having recovered its stranded investment
costs from its ratepayers, Semipro Energy is charging market rates to 
consumers
which are complaining of higher electric bills.  While the government has
intervened by approving price caps on ancillary electric service in the state
and has capped the electric bills of low-income consumers in San Diego, the
state regulators are calling for more government involvement.

In California several proposals are on the table:
1)   A consumer group has called for the "excessive" profits earned by
generators and marketers this past summer to be retroactively refunded to
ratepayers.  .
2)   U.S. Rep. Bob Finer, D-California, introduced a bill to the House that
would create disincentives for power companies to earn profits, imposing a
windfall profits tax on wholesale power sold in the western U.S.
3)   As recently as last night, October 26, the California Independent System
Operator (ISO) implemented an interim measure that imposes hourly price caps 
on
generators based on forecasted load and arbitrary heat rates ranging between
negative $100/MWh and positive $250/MWh.  Effective on 11/3, the proposal
essentially shuts down the peaking generation plants which would not be able 
to
economically produce power within the state.
4)   California ISO staff has also proposed to impose a "bid" cap on 
electricity
of $100/mWh on power generators and marketers in the state that do not comply
with the requirement of selling 70% of their load under forward contracts 
within
the state of California.  Compliance with this Market Stabilization Plan means
that spot power will be sold under the existing $250/mWh price cap but 
violators
would be subjected to the $100 bid cap.
5)   California plans to require interruptible users of power to extend their
contracts, preventing these end users from switching to firm contracts, thus
ensuring that certain customers can be shut off in the event of a power
shortage.

While we doubt that any of these proposals will be passed in their current 
form,
the government is likely to be involved.  The Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC) has been overseeing the deregulation of the wholesale energy
markets, and has approved price caps in all of the regions that have opened to
competition thus far except for in the Midwest.  As a reminder, the FERC is 
made
up of commissioners that are appointed by the reigning President, and 
currently
the FERC is made up of three Democrats and one Republican (the other 
Republican
commissioner resigned earlier this year).

On Thursday, October 26, 2000, the sole Republican, Commissioner Curt Hebert,
Jr., gave a presentation to members of the Greater Houston Partnership on the
subject of "Competition and America's Energy Policy".  While his opinions are
not necessarily representative of the FERC as a whole, Hebert clearly supports
regulatory flexibility and free markets but is also sensitive to environmental
issues.  He is also vehemently opposed to price controls such as electricity
price caps in New England, New York and California.  Hebert believes that the
recent electricity price spikes in the West this past summer were great market
indicators that electric generation is in short supply, particularly during
periods of hot weather.  In the summer of 1999, the Midwest experienced 
similar
price spikes also related to summer heat.  The difference between the two
situations is that the Midwest allowed the market to decide, which responded
with new generation projects, but California imposed price controls on
electricity that have had the affect of discouraging new generation.  Thus, 
the
short supply situation in California may just get worse.

The FERC has completed an investigation of the recent electricity price spikes
in California but does not intend to release its findings to the general 
public.
  While we believe that the FERC will find a way to help resolve the situation
in that state, any actions would not likely take affect until 2002.  In the
interim, the electric utilities are suffering under a growing burden of
uncollected power purchase costs and are calling on the state regulators to
provide emergency financial relief.  Proposals include a refundable rate
surplus, removal of frozen rates, and/or the deferral of stranded cost 
recovery.
  We are doubtful that the FERC will rule on any action prior to the elections
because political considerations may influence their decisions.

Commissioner Hebert indicated that this was an opportunity for the FERC to 
send
to the electricity industry a signal on what may make the markets work, and
believe that any plan should be "bold, ambitious and strict" in requiring
results.  Renewable fuels are also likely to be encouraged, although this is 
not
necessarily good news for the natural gas industry, and old issues like the
Fuel Use Act and the "Btu" tax may resurface.  Ideally, the FERC would endorse
market pricing and encourage the development of electricity generation and
transmission infrastructure.  However, by doing so, the FERC may be perceived 
as
the "bad guy", which may not be ideal image in an election year.  However,
Hebert is hopeful that the FERC will move beyond politics and make the right
regulatory decision for the long term.  The benefits of price controls are 
short
term, and those markets under price caps may be disadvantages as the rest of
the U.S. opens to electric competition.

Mark, I'm sure you are aware of the comments in the press that I have copied and inserted here below.  There have been others that are similar.  Basically, the press is reporting that we have dissolved the LJM partnerships, ended all relationships with the LJM entities, etc.  All that we have done is unwind the raptor entities, LJM still exists, all other transactions with LJM still exist, it's just that Andy sold his interest in the partnerships.  Michael Kopper owns them and would probably be considered a "friend of Enron" by investors/journalists.

I'm concerned about our efforts to build back investor confidence - do we correct the press?  how do we address this?  I'm concerned that we will once again be hit with credibility concerns when the press or investors fully understand that LJM still exists and we have deals still pending with it and have deals still in place with it.  How do we correct this erroneous press?   Sherron Watkins

   "BLAME CANADA" - Some Thoughts on the California Energy Crisis, the FERC
            Settlement Negotiations and Wholesale Energy Companies


***"BLAME CANADA" - Curiously Absent in the California Debate

***MOVING BACK FROM THE PRECIPICE - Will the FERC Settlement Process Prevent
Governor Davis from Leading the Industry (and the State of California) Over the
Precipice?

***CONFUSING NUMBERS

There are admittedly a lot of numbers floating out there with respect to the
California Power Crisis.  The administrative law judge (ADL) for the FERC,
Curtis L. Wagner Jr., is currently knee-deep in these numbers and allegations
as he attempts to reach a settlement between the various sides of this issue
during a compact 15-day settlement period mandated by the FERC.  The deadline
for this settlement if July 9th - if no settlement is reached, the FERC has
threatened to impose its own solution, which would most likely lead to a
protracted legal battle that could play out over several years.

California Dreaming $9 Billion - But Where Does the Number Come From?  One
thing does appear to be clear here - no one, including Judge Wagner, appears to
have any idea where this $9 billion number, which Governor Davis and his
compatriots keep quoting, comes from.  According to the information we have
obtained, the total amount of "Estimated Wholesale Revenues Above Competitive
Market Baseline" (pre and post Oct 2000) for the generators over which the FERC
has jurisdictional control is around $4.75 billion.  However, as has already
been pointed out many times, the FERC can only order refunds from Oct. of last
year onward due to a Federal law which requires a filing for refunds to be made
within 60 days of the purchases - the CA. ISO didn't begin appealing for
refunds until Dec. of 2000.  Therefore, looking at the Oct.-Feb. time period,
the amount involved appears to be more like $2.61 billion for generators over
which the FERC has jurisdictional control.  For all generators, the numbers
look more like $3.8 billion for the Oct.-Feb. time period and $6.8 billion for
the entire period - May 2000 through Feb. 2001.

It's worth noting that none of the generating companies know where any of these
numbers from the CA. ISO come from and what the bases of any of these
calculations are.  For now these numbers appear to be just another data point
in the negotiations, although they clearly do appear to undermine the
California's position on the $ 9 billion refund its demanding.  Judge Wagner
has already appeared to put out one data point in the negotiations, stating at
the outset that the California is owed refunds (of course, California hasn't
paid its bills yet on this issue, so calling this a refund is a bit
disingenuous) of perhaps a billion dollars or so (according to the Wall Street
Journal).  We believe that this represents one line of demarcation being set
out by the judge early on to encourage both sides in this debate.  Known
reserves, or quoted reserves, taken by generators or wholesale energy companies
involved total more than $1 billion, and of course that doesn't include
everyone since there are a number of generators involved who aren't or haven't,
disclosed any information.

Reserved Amounts, Amounts Owed to Generators by CA. ISO, Alleged Overcharge
Computed by CA. ISO - No Wonder Investors Having Been Steering Clear.  Based on
our conversations with investors over the past several weeks, it appears that
many investors see good value in some of the wholesale energy companies and
independent power producers at current levels, but the problem is the political
uncertainty.  Emerging Markets political psychology has now become a part of
valuing these companies as it relates to the "third world" nature of the
California power system.  This is in line with what we began to warn investors
about several weeks ago with respect to this crisis, but it also could
represent an excellent buying opportunities in certain names.  We continue to
believe that somehow, someone (or something, in the case of the FERC) will
eventually lead us back from the precipice from where Governor Davis has been
taking this issue.  Alongside a potential resolution of this case through the
current settlement negotiations, strong second quarter earnings from these
companies could also provide a catalyst.

If we were to assume that the ultimate settlement figure were to be less than
this "floated figure" by Judge Wagner at the outset of this settlement process,
then on the face of it the generators would appear to be more than fully
reserved on this issue.  However, that assumes that a settlement can be reached
in the allotted 15 days, that is not more than $1 billion, and also assumes
that each companies established reserves, or lack of reserves, proves to be in
line (this last area being the most doubtful).  As an example, Enron (ENE -
Attractive Rated) has, according to the company, booked reserves on this issue
of $435 million while it claims to be owed $570 million by the CA. ISO.
However, the alleged overcharge by Enron by the CA. ISO is only $39 million.
Enron, it would appear from these numbers, could stand to make a windfall from
these settlement negotiations.  On the other hand, Reliant (REI - Not Rated)
appears to have reserved just $39 million but claims to be owed $358 million by
the CA. ISO.  The CA. ISO, however, appears to be claiming that REI overcharged
it by $750 million, although realistically the figure here we should focus on
is $378 million based on the Oct, 2000 - Feb., 2001 time period.  The problem
is of course, no one knows how the CA. ISO's figures were calculated, let along
Governor Davis has lifted his $9 billion figure from.

Breaking Down the Numbers. In the enclosed excel file we have broken down
information (where available) for the various wholesale energy companies and
independent power producers with respect to alleged overcharge by the CA. ISO,
the reported EBIT for these companies in fiscal year 2000, the amount that
these companies have claimed is owed them by the CA. ISO and the approximate
reserves each of these companies has taken with respect to this issue.  In many
cases, these are obviously not hard data points since they can't be readily
located in filings by these companies with the SEC.  Some of the figures come
from various public statements made by the heads of these companies, or are
lifted from articles where they were attributed to someone at these companies.
.  Attached File  (Please Request File Separately in the Case of First Call
Note).

The Camouflaged Canadians.  It has been interesting to read through articles
regarding the California Power crisis, and even to watch "supposedly" well-
researched documentaries that are expected to present a "balanced" thorough
account of what has been and what continues to happen in California and
throughout the Western United States.  This is a complicated subject, a
complicated chain of events which has led to this crisis, but it is still
stunning at times to see major issues missed by the press, or ignored by the
California Governor's office, in assessing this issue.  More often than not,
the hydroelectric system in the Pacific Northwest and the integral role it
plays in supplying California power during the summer doesn't get adequate
attention, nor does the hydro system of our neighbors up north.  You want to
know who has made the most money yet off the California Power Crisis - look
north.  For obvious political and legal reasons, Governor Davis in California
has pointed the finger solely and continually at Houston, Texas.  However,
perhaps Governor Davis and/or the rest of California should perhaps focus some
attention on Canada if they want to determine who gained the most from this
crisis.  Through the first three-quarters of 2000, BC Hydro's net income
increased by close to $860 million on a y/y basis.  According to info we have
seen related to the California ISO calculations regarding potential
overcharges, that appears to be the single largest amount of money made from
the California Energy Crisis (we have assumed for now in this statement that
California would deem all of the increase in profit on a y/y basis to be
illegally gained, which is admittedly an overstatement, but then again these
figures for BC Hydro don't include fourth quarter results for 2000 whereas the
Ca. ISO comparison figures do).   Fourth quarter results for BC Hydro are not
expected to be reported until somewhere on July 9-11, but we would expect the
fourth quarter to be a "whopping number".  The attached excel sheet provides
more data, but the quarterly net incomes for BC Hydro and % y/y increases were
as follows; 1Q00 - $306 million, up 147% y/y; 2Q00 - $658 million, up 306% y/y;
3Q00 - $362 million, up 100% y/y; 4Q00 - ?.

According to the information we have been able to find, it looks as if BC Hydro
announced two rebates to their Canadian customers during 2000 which look to
total around $1.5 Billion.  Canadians don't vote in California's 2002
Gubernatorial race, nor will they be allowed to vote in the 2004 Presidential
Election in this country.  And although we're not lawyers, it seems that is
would be more than a little difficult for Governor Davis to sue Canadians and
their ratepayers for a return of these rebates.  Perhaps we quibble, but it
would appear to be selective prosecution on the part of the California
politicians.  But then again, perhaps California's attorney general has a "jail
partner" in mind as well for the head of BC Hydro.

Angela - thanks for making time to have dinner with us on Wednesday:  it
was great to see you.

As Art mentioned, since the time we have started working with you, we have
made frequent references to our operating teams about Enron's
accomplishments in the areas of customer excellence and employee
satisfaction.  More generally, we've held Enron out as an example of a
highly accomplished company in all the areas Macerich is currently focusing
on as an organization (operational integration, customer orientation,
scalability, change leadership, and strategic focus).

All of that being said, we would be extremely appreciative of an
opportunity to have either Jeff Skilling or Dave Delainey speak at either
of these conferences.  In any event, we're delighted that you would make an
effort to see if this can be put together.

Relative to upcoming Macerich events, there are two scheduled:

(1) University of Notre Dame Executive Education Program, May 7 - 9 in
South Bend.  The curriculum is centered on change leadership and strategic
thinking (officially "Enhanced Leadership and Strategy in the New
Economy").  Attendees include our Executive Team (Art, David, Rick,Tom, Ed,
and Larry Sidwell) and our Operating Team (17 SVPs).  There is also a
round-table discussion scheduled with our Board on May 9.

(2) Macerich's Company Conference, June 4 - 7 in Park Cities, Utah.  The
emphasis of the conference will be on our "e-Business Transformation" (more
specifically on becoming wholly integrated across functional roles,
customer facing, and highly scalable) and capturing value in our "Value
Network" (relationships we have with retailers, partners, vendors,
shoppers, etc.)  The attendees for this event include the same people at
UND as well as our managerial professionals from the malls and our
corporate offices (about 250 people, total).

Let me know if you need any additional background or information.

Eric

I'm sure this is just a "misunderstanding", but I know that UBS Capital has spent innumerable hours with management.  While Mark says that he doesn't want LJM to have an advantage, it looks like LJM is being put at a disadvantage.  You would think that Cliff and Mark would welcome a new bidder with open arms after failing to sell this business for 2+ years.  Until this is resolved, I'll assume that LJM is out of the bidding and will not do any further work.  Enron is back to one bidder (the lower one) -- better for our company ???

Andy - Mark Metts called tonight and has asked me not to meet with you in Houston tomorrow.  His stated concern is over disparate/more favorable treatment of you (LJM) as opposed to other bidders for EWC.  As we have discussed, while I am very interested in an LJM financed MBO, at this stage I need you to sort out any process issues with Cliff/Mark and/or Jeff.

Guys, the outside date on termination due to force majeure was moved to

Subject: Elektrobolt DASH - EE&CC Questions/Comments

Larry:

Rick Buy has asked that I respond to you directly on your concerns outlined 
in your memo this morning:

1.  With respect to EPC price, the range in the DASH text indicates EPC Price 
range reported to us by the deal team without the contingency.   Dan Leff has 
changed the DASH to reflect a range with the $10 million contingency.  For 
modelling purposes, we have used the following aggregated values in our 
probabilistic evaluation to account for the EPC Contract Price and a $10 
million hard cost contingency:

   ($000s)
P5   $194.25
P50 (expected)  $210.00    
P95   $225.75

2.  With regard to schedule, I am told that EE&CC has a copy of the 
Consortium Agreement where this information is contained.  I retrieved this 
information from that document.  I have attached a copy of the Consortium 
Agreement.  I hear your points and understand the risk.  The schedule will be 
driven by receipt of the necessary permits.  If the permitting process does 
not proceed as expected, I recommend that EWS/Americas Management reconsider 
the incremental investment in the project.  On-going dialogue between 
EWS/Americas and EE&CC will be essential in determining the continued 
viability of the schedule.  Enron owns 25% of CEG and does not have 
control--I would recommend that we consult with Enron legal on this question.



3.  It is prudent to restrict expenditures to $15 million until we receive 
our permits given this is the maximum recoverable amount from Petrobras.  
From a permitting perspective, we are unable to commence construction of the 
plant beyond site clearance without the actual environmental and installation 
permits anyway, so whether or not we place a $15 million constraint on 
expenditure, the absence of permits will not allow for further construction.  
An issue comes along with respect to long-lead items and whether these should 
be ordered in advance of permit issuance.  Our understanding is that the $15 
million figure was derived with the assistance of EE&CC and takes into 
consideration funding required for long-lead items.

4.  The 9169 btu/kwh is assumed to be LHV in the model.

5.  The Consortium Agreement anticipates a 92% availability for maximum 
payout of the capacity payment.  The capacity payment is discounted ratably 
to the extent the Equivalent Availability Factor is less than 92% as per 
Schedule 8.06 in the Consortium Agreement.

With regard to future co-ordination, please designate an individual to be 
placed on the circulation for all DASHs in the future.  I will ensure that a 
DASH is provided within a time frame appropriate for response and discussion.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.

Regards,

Chip

12/19/2000 10:04 AM
To: Rick Buy/HOU/ECT@ECT
cc: Richard Leibert/HOU/EES@EES 
Subject: DASH FOR RIOGEN MERCHANT (AKA "ELECTROBOLT")

Rick, I was provided a copy of the DASH at 6:30 PM last evening and asked to 
sign off soonest.  My comments follow:

Cost:  the DASH is incorrect.  EECC has provided both a cost - plus price and 
a guaranteed price.
EECC has provided a NEPCO-guaranted price of $215MM.
EECC has indicated that it's estimate of actual costs is most likely $205MM.  
We indicated this cost estimate was somewhat conservative.  Since last week, 
the cost estimate has been further revised to $202MM.  It is unlikely that 
the actual costs of the project will be significantly less than $202MM.  
$202MM represents a cost estimate with the Owners maintaining the risk of 
overruns and schedule.  This would require the Owner to maintain a 
contingency in his proforma above the most likely expected cost of $202MM.
After providing the above information to the Developer, the Developer was 
going to take a look at the carrying cost of turbines which were inside this 
estimate; I have no update on whether the turbine price changed from the 
numbers I saw last week.
Schedule:  Neither my team nor I had seen the provisions of termination by 
Petrobras, as stated in the DASH, prior to last evening.  The ability of 
Petrobras to terminate at April 30, 2002 if the project is not completed due 
to circumstances within Enron's controls, is an unlikely risk, but not 
totally impossible.  Further, the project is subject to a June 30, 2002, 
termination by Petrobras if the project is not completed due to force 
majeure.  This is considered more of an onerous risk.  It's not clear to me 
whether the requirement to complete the pipeline and bring gas to the project 
would be considered under Enron's control, considering that Enron is a 
partial Owner in CEG, the gas distribution pipeline company.
On the other hand, we have indicated that an October 31, 2001 start-up, is 
reasonable, based on a full NTP by January 1, and site access on February 1.  
If the schedule is constrained by the RAC recommendation to limit expenses to 
$15MM, the October 31, start-up could be at risk.
Performance:  The stated agreement with Petrobras for 365 megawatts (site 
condition) and an average net degraded heat rate of 9169 btu/kWH, appears 
correct, if it is LHV.
O&M Guarantee:  The DASH is not clear on what O&M availability guarantee 
Enron is prepared to sign with Petrobras.  I would suggest that OEC insure it 
agrees with any availability guarantees prior to Enron signing the Petrobras 
agreement.

Rick, sorry for this late feedback, but our system of coordination with the 
RAC needs improvement.  In the days when I worked with EI, EECC would provide 
to EI a written due diligence report direct, after checking the proforma 
against the PPA.  This was an Enron lesson-learned after years of 
experience.  The recent reorganizations have diluted this procedure.  I 
suggest I discuss with you how to improve our due diligence process.

Regards,

Larry

It is time to begin working on planning for the Africa business trip which we 
are planning for next february.  I don't think we have a specific date yet, 
but if we can get Terrie, Dorothy, and Sherri to reserve some dates on our 
calendars and we can begin inviting customers now and based on the customer 
feedback, zero in on final dates in a month or so.  I think we should plan on 
having 12 to 15 people total attend.  Assuming 4 Enron people and 4 or 5 last 
minute dropouts, we should target inviting 10 to 15 customers.  My initial 
cut on these are below:


Skilling:

 "Billy Bob" Kriegel Sithe
 Sam Palmisano? IBM
 Scott McNealy?  Sun
 JeanMarie Messier? Vivendi
 John Bryson!!  Socal Edison
 Others?

EBS Hirko/Rice

 Mark Gilman  Blockbuster
 Don Listwin?  Cisco
 Bob Knowling?  Covad
 Alternative 1
 Alternative 2

ECM/Fastow

 Banker 1
 Banker 2
 Banker 3
 

Wrobel

 Asian Guy 1
 Asian Guy 2
 Asian Guy 3

Let's shoot for the first round of names no later that July 10, so we can 
have Terrie send out invites.  Also, Sherri,Terri - have we restructured our 
deal with the guides?

SQUEEZING BLOOD FROM A STONE: SEEKING CLARITY IN THE CALIF. CRISIS

January 4, 2001    SUMMARY
                   * California utilities (PCG, EIX) threaten bankruptcy in
Raymond Niles        face of cash squeeze and decision by California Public
212-816-2807         Utilities Commission to grant a 7%-15% rate increase
ray.niles@ssmb.com   versus the 20%-30% hoped for by the utilities. Two key
                     points:
                   * (1) Based on the companies' statements, we think there
                     is material risk that the California utilities will
                     declare bankruptcy, although this still remains the least
                     likely outcome, in our view.  We maintain our 3H

                     High Risk) rating on PCG at the present time.
                   * (2) We recommend investors hold the course on Energy
                     Merchants and Competitive Generators.  Favorable 
long-term
                     fundamentals remain in place.  Ultimately, we think a
                     market-oriented solution will favor these companies, but
                     anticipate near-term uncertainty as the California
                     situation plays itself out.  Companies with most to least
                     California exposure are: CPN, SOE, DYN, NRG, DUK, REI,
                     AES, ENE.
TWO MESSAGES TO INVESTORS

(1) Worry about the California electric utilities:  PCG and EIX.  Material
bankruptcy risk exists for these companies.  Although we do not think it is 
the
most likely outcome, we think the risk of a bankruptcy has been heightened by
the small rate increase proposed by the California Public Utilities 
Commission.
Even if bankruptcy does not occur, we think that the California utilities will
continue to be challenged by weak balance sheets and ongoing cash flow 
concerns
if adequate rate increases are not enacted.

(2) Hold the course on the Energy Merchants and Competitive Generators.  The
long-term fundamentals for these companies remains firm, in our view.  For the
generators, we forecast 20%-25% higher power prices, nationwide, in 2001 vs.
2000.  At the same time, we see the "spark spread", or the spread between 
power
(revenues) and gas (costs) widening by several percentage points during the
same time period.  Both of these factors are positive for earnings.  For the
marketers, the opportunity to hedge and manage energy price risk has only been
heightened by the turmoil in California.  We also remain bullish on these
companies.

corporate financial exposure to California is far less than the percentages
indicated

WHAT LIES AHEAD?  POINTS TO CONSIDER:

(1) Someone must pay for the cost of power in California.  Currently, natural
gas prices are around $20 per mcf or million BTU's, which equates to
electricity prices north of $200 per megawatt-hour.  This reflects the cost of
burning gas to create electricity, and does not consider other costs, such as
pollution emissions, operating and maintenance costs, and the capital costs of
plant investment.

(2) The long-term problem in California (and elsewhere in the country) will 
not
be solved without the construction of new power plants.  All the bellyaching 
in
the world about high wholesale power prices will not solve the problem, which
is:  California does not have enough power plants.  The wholesale price of
electricity reflects supply and demand.  There are not enough electrons in the
state's power grid.  More electrons will come either from new plants (power
generation) or marketing (shipping more electricity into the state).  We also
think concomitant infrastructure must be enhanced, such as natural gas 
pipeline
and electric transmission capacity.

(3) The generators and marketers are solving the problem.  Companies such as
Dynegy, Enron, El Paso Energy, Duke Energy, Calpine, Southern Energy, AES, NRG
Energy and others are either building the plants and/or marketing the power 
and
natural gas that will, in the long run, "solve" California's power crisis.  In
fact, the high prices they are receiving for power and gas are both the
incentives and the reward for them to do so.  In our view, if sufficient new
generating capacity is built in California, the wholesale price of power will
fall.  We think if policies were enacted today to facilitate the construction
of new plants, by 2002 power prices could be materially lower than they are
today.

(4) Re-regulation would only lengthen and deepen the power crisis in
California.  Capping wholesale power prices, imposing windfall profits taxes 
or
other "punitive" measures will not cause a single new power plant to be built
or a single new electron to be sold in the state.  Such measures would dis-
incentivize new plant construction and actually lengthen the crisis.  We
already think that the threat of re-regulation has had the perverse effect of
raising wholesale power prices by dis-incentivizing sales into the state.

OUR INVESTMENT CONCLUSIONS

First, the long-term outlook for competitive energy suppliers is favorable.
They are supplying a commodity in short supply.  As long as the supply-demand
balance, and price volatility remain, we expect strong earnings visibility 
from
this core group of companies.  We especially recommend accumulating positions
in these companies ahead of the summer peak electricity earnings season.

Second, attempts to re-regulate or "punish" energy wholesalers could create
near-term volatility in the stocks; we recommend buying on such weakness.
Given our long-term view, we do not think that attempts to re-regulate will be
successful.  In fact, by doing so, policymakers would merely lengthen and
deepen the crisis that already exists.  Also, recognition that the wholesale
market is working well in other regions, such as Texas, would only stimulate a
debate that would lead to ultimate removal of any controls, in our view.

WHAT'S AHEAD?  NEAR-TERM EVENTS

Near-term, we await several events.  Each of these has the potential for
creating trading opportunities in the stocks.

(1) Decision by S&P and Moody's on whether to downgrade the debt of PCG and
EIX.  They have threatened to lower the ratings on both companies to "junk"
status (i.e., below investment grade) if the CPUC does not grant a sufficient
rate increase.  We think that the 7%-15% rate increase proposed by the CPUC is
probably not sufficient to please the rating agencies, and that a debt
downgrade is likely.  We think a debt downgrade is largely priced into the
stocks, but the action still could create volatility.

(2) An emergency legislative hearing is underway.  This hearing is deciding,
among other measures, whether to impose a "windfall profits tax" or other
punitive measures on the wholesale energy suppliers.  Given what we said 
above,
we think such a move could hurt the energy suppliers, but only on a near-term
basis.  We would recommend buying on such weakness.  An action that would be
positive, in our view, would be any move by the legislature to address the 
root
cause of California's problem:  the restrictive policies that make it 
difficult
to build plants in the state (e.g.: pollution rules, siting permits, etc).

(3) Decisions by the utilities on whether to declare bankruptcy.  The 
utilities
suffer from a negative cash flow, and have incurred over $8 billion in
incremental costs to pay for power.  Their cash gross margin is negative
because they receive a low (regulated) price for retail power and pay a high
(unregulated) price for wholesale power.  The utilities' lenders are watching
carefully to see if any rate increase proposed by the CPUC is sufficient to
address this imbalance before they will lend more money on a short-term basis.
If the utilities cannot get short-term funding, we think insolvency is a 
likely
eventuality, in our view.  We still think bankruptcy is the least likely
outcome, and for that reason, a bankruptcy announcement would have a negative
effect on the stock prices of the utilities as well as the wholesale energy
suppliers.

(4) Final decision by the CPUC on their proposed rate increase.  A final
decision on the 7%-15% proposed increase will be made today.  If the CPUC
decides to go with a higher or more favorable rate increase, this would be
positive for the utilities and marketers..

(5) Credit risk to suppliers - worst case analysis.  The generators and
marketers who sell power to the California utilities have significant credit
risks associated with those exposures.  The figure below attempts to quantify
those risks, which could result in a one-time earnings hit.  The figures we
have calculated are a worst-case analysis, in our view, and any actual 
exposure
are likely to be much less.  First, these risks will only become a reality in
the case of the utilities' bankruptcy.  Second, even given this worst-case
bankruptcy scenario, the generators and marketers will likely be treated
favorably in the bankruptcy case, given their status as trade creditors (30-45
day receivables).  Third, based on our conversations with these companies, 
they
have already taken steps to mitigate these exposures by tightening credit
limits, requiring payments in cash, etc.

FYI--

The information below is an excellent overview of the procedures our administrative personnel will be using when handling and distributing your mail into mail folders.  However, all administrative personnel in the Portland Enron WTC offices have received a hard copy of the guidelines and procedures issued by Oregon Department Administrative Services.  This four-page document has detailed guidelines and instructions for mail/parcel handling.  If you would like to get a copy of these guidelines, ask your administrative assistant or you can contact Debra Davidson to get a copy.  The World Trade Center Mailroom has informed Debra that they are also screening mail for lumps, powdery substances, unusual written comments on envelopes, etc.  If they detect a suspicious piece of mail or package addressed to our office, they will notify us as well as the proper authorities.

If you have any questions or concerns, please see me or Debra Davidson.

Subject:	Anthrax and other Biological Agent Threats

We understand that the recent cases of Anthrax contamination and the possibility that biological agents such as Anthrax may be used in a terrorist attack are raising great concerns among Enron employees.  Many government and commercial facilities in the United States have already received Anthrax threat letters containing powdery substances.  Most of these have, however, been determined to be false alarms.  We have no reason to believe that Enron has been or will be the target of an Anthrax attack, but we want to provide all employees with background information on Anthrax and up-to-date guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures.

If you have additional questions or concerns, please contact Corporate Security in Houston at (713) 345-2804 or via email at CorporateSecurity@enron.com.

The most important thing to remember is:  Do not panic.  To infect someone, the Anthrax organism must be rubbed into abraded skin, swallowed, or inhaled as a fine, aerosolized mist.  Infection can be prevented after exposure to Anthrax by early treatment with the appropriate antibiotics.  Anthrax cannot be spread from one person to another.

Following are guidelines for identifying and dealing with suspicious letters or packages:

What constitutes a suspicious letter or parcel?  (Remember, these are only guidelines.  Use your best judgment when determining if a letter or package is suspicious.)

--  It is marked with the word "Anthrax."
--  It has a non-identifiable powdery substance on the outside.
--  It is unexpected or from someone unfamiliar to you.
--  Is addressed to someone no longer with your organization or is otherwise outdated.
--  Has no return address, or has one that cannot be verified as legitimate.
--  Is of unusual weight, given its size, or is lopsided or oddly shaped.
--  Has an unusual amount of tape on it.
--  Is marked with restrictive endorsements such as "personal" or "confidential".
--  Has a strange odor or stain.
--  Shows a city or country in the postmark that does not match the return address.

What do I do if I receive such a letter or package that I believe contains Anthrax?
--  Do not shake or empty the contents of any suspicious envelope or package.
--  Place the envelope or package in a plastic bag or some other type of container to prevent leakage of contents.
--  If you do not have any container, then cover the envelope or package with anything (e.g., clothing, paper, trash can, etc.) and do not remove this cover.
--  Leave the room and close the door, or section off the area to prevent others from entering (i.e., keep others away). 
-- Wash your hands with soap and water to prevent spreading any powder to your face.
--  Notify your local building security official or an available supervisor.  Have them call 911 to alert the local police authorities.
--  List all people who were in the room or area when this suspicious letter or package was recognized. Give this list to both the local public health authorities and law enforcement officials for follow-up investigations and advice.  
If you open an envelope or package and a suspicious powder spills out:
--  Do not try to clean up the powder.  Cover the spilled contents immediately with anything (e.g., clothing, paper, trash can, etc.) and do not remove this cover! 
--  Leave the room and close the door, or section off the area to prevent others from entering (i.e., keep others away).
--  Wash your hands with soap and water to prevent spreading any powder to your face.  Report the incident to your local building security official or an available supervisor.  Have them call 911 to alert the local police authorities. 
--  Remove heavily contaminated clothing as soon as possible and place in a plastic bag, or some other container that can be sealed.  This clothing bag should be given to the emergency responders for proper handling. 
--  Shower with soap and water as soon as possible.  Do not use bleach or other disinfectant on your skin. 
--  If possible, list all people who were in the room or area, especially those who had actual contact with the powder. Give this list to both the local public health authorities so that proper instructions can be given for medical follow-up, and to law enforcement officials for further investigation.

Over the past few months, Enron Global Finance has been evaluating various opportunities where Enron and Smith Graham & Company may be able to work together.  Unfortunately, the process was slowed when our primary contact at Smith Graham, Gabriel Hayes, left the firm earlier this year.  We have since reestablished discussions and the Global Finance Group is preparing a proposal that a portion (about $30 million) of the Enron Cash Balance Plan portfolio be dedicated to an emerging managers portfolio.  One-third of this money ($10 million) would be invested in bonds, which could be placed with Smith Graham, as the fixed-income manager .  (Total Plan assets are about $235 million.)

The proposal will be submitted to the Plan Administrative Committee at its quarterly meeting on May 3rd.  The proposal should be well received as the Committiee has previously requested that  we optimize our existing allocation to minority money managers.  Gerald Smith has been advised that Enron is looking at ways to allocate money to the firm, and that a decision should be reached sometime in May.  We have not communicated the specific details of our intentions as of yet pending the outcome of the May 3rd meeting.

I am available for further discussion at your convenience.

As we have discussed at the Board level as well as in Management Commitee, the default swap market is extremely illiquid.  While it is true that ENE is one of the most liquid names in the market, the entire market would move based on an order of $40 to $50 MM.  We have heard that there have been standing sell orders in the market totalling approximately $150 MM which have yet to be absorbed, it could be that the prices moved significantly in order for those sellers to find a buyer.

While this market is an important datapoint in evaluating the credit markets view of our name, it is not the sole determinant.  It is important to note that secondary trading levels of our bonds (a far more liquid market and accurate indicator of our ability to raise incremental capital) have only widened 5 - 10 basis points over the course of the day. 

While I would very much like to tighten the spreads in the default swap market, I think that we need to keep those price markers  in perspective.  Having said that, anything we can do to support the credit and tighten those prices ultimately helps in our ability to raise debt in all markets.

John thought you might be interested in the following from the credit markets....

Play by play during the call on the 5yr Enron Credit Default Swaps from Morgan Stanley:

1.  5Y BIDS GETTING HIT ON OPENING AS EARNINGS NEWS LOOKED LIKE
    CLEANING HOUSE.  250.
2.  DURING THE CONFERENCE CALL; WHICH APPARENTLY WAS UNCLEAR,
    TICKED OUT 255,260,265.
3.  LAY INDICATED NEAR END OF CONFERENCE "NO RATINGS ACTION
    ANTICIPATED".   MINUTE CONFERENCE ENDED MOODY'S WATCH NEWS
    RELEASED.  280 BID.
4.  LAY ALSO MENTIONED 3Q NEG CASH FLOW DUE TO SOME CONTRACT
    ROLLOFF.  UNCLEAR MESSSAGE.
5.  ENE SAYS COMMITTED TO "INV GRADE" RATHER THAN "A"  280/325


Summary from Morgan Stanley after the call:

CREDIT DERIVATIVE UPDATE:  ENRON CORP

AFTER THE NEWS THIS AM ($1 BIL. CHARGE), THE COMPANY HOSTED A
CALL AT 10AM NY TIME.   THE CALL DID NOT GO WELL & ENRON SPREADS
ARE HEADING WIDER IN CREDIT DERIVATIVE LAND.  MKTS ARE SPOOKED
B/C:  1) MOODY'S WATCHLISTED CO NEGATIVE, 2) ENE STATED "THEY
ARE COMMITED TO INVESTMENT GRADE RATING," WHICH IS A CHANGE FROM
THE SINGLE-A BOGEY THEY ONCE EXTOLED, 3) CO. DID NOT ADDRESS ALL
LIQUIDITY CONCERNS, AND 4) MORE CHARGES COMING?
5YR MARKETS:

      ENE (PRE-WTC):   165/185        ENE (8AM TODAY): 240/260
      ENE (WEEK AGO):  250/300      **ENE NOW:         275/350

Clearly the above are a function of what people think they heard...I did not alter any of the email.  In general MSDW likes Enron credit but this is how they see the market.  Enron is one of the most actively traded names in the credit derivative market.  Let me know if you want updates as the market gets more clarity and works throught the details

  $2.955 billion. The original deal, in November 1999, was for $3.1 billion
  with Sierra Pacific Resources (SRP: $15.12: $0.80 Div: 5.29% yield). This was
  $300 mm better than we expected in our September 28 report, which upgraded
  ENE to a Strong Buy.

* This deal has very few externalities, and should close twelve months hence.
  Both companies are Oregon-based, and should get a better regulatory break
  than ENE did when it bought PGE in July 1997.

* The impact on ENE? (1) Very little gain or loss on sale of the assets; (2)
  Interest expense reductions should largely offset expected $140 mm (after
  tax) annual PGE earnings contribution; (3) A better balance sheet, with total
  leverage dropping from 61.9% to 57.3% if done today.

* This is a step in the right direction. PG&E will be in much better hands to
  pursue its Oregon agenda, and ENE will look better without PGE's presence. We
  continue to rate ENE a Strong Buy up to $36; it becomes a Buy from $36 to
  $40. Our 12-month price target is $42-$44.

Current Events:

The deal is straightforward. NWN will raise $1.55 billion in cash, $200 mm in
Feline Prides, and will issue $50 mm in NWN stock to Enron.  NWN will assume the
residual $75 mm obligation inflicted on ENE by the Oregon PUC as the price of
regulatory peace (i.e., ransom demands) at the time of the original acquisition.
This brings the total purchase price to $1.87 billion for PGE's $1.118 billion
of common equity. NWN will assume $1.05 billion of total debt and $29 mm of
straight preferreds. The price-to-book is 167%. PGE has been earning in the $125
mm-$140 mm after-tax area, although the numbers may work higher this year ($150
mm) because of FASB 133 (mark-to-market) profits on longer-dated power trading
of $16 mm being realized (so far). The approximate P/E is about 12.5x forecasts.
The electric group is now trading at 11.5x 01Es and 10.9x 02Es.

The regulatory due process should take about 12 months. There are no looming
rate cases, ROE or capital structure issues. The OPUC ranks very low among state
PUCs in terms of providing fair or competitive ROEs for investors. We were
pleased to learn that the OPUC has finally ditched the CAPM (capital asset
pricing model) as a worthless relic for determining costs of capital and has
embraced discounted cash flow methodology. The bad news was that this still
didn't prevent the OPUC from rolling over PGE in its August 1 rate case
settlement, dropping the allowed ROE from 11.6% to 10.5%. The annualized
earnings impact looks like $8-$9 mm after-tax.

Given the very parochial nature of the Oregon retail energy market, there is no
question in our mind that this should be a worthwhile deal for NWN and a win for
ENE, as well. If the deal were closed today, ENE would deleverage to the tune
of the $2.95 billion proceeds, or from 61.9% to 57.3% total leverage. It would
also trade up ENE's unnecessarily low composite ROE from the 12.5% area to
something better. PGE's secular growth rate is 3%-4% annually in rate base
terms, and its EBIT contribution would run only 8%-9% of ENE's totals in
2002-2003. There would be very little book gain or loss on the sale, and the
$1.4 billion of underlying goodwill on the PGE assets will disappear. ENE had to
reincorporate in Oregon at the time of the PGE purchase. Chances are that it
will be a Delaware corporation by this time next year.

On the other hand, NWN has seized a very good, but highly leveraged opportunity.
Both managements are largely in sync, covering much of the same ground already.
The synergies can be meaningful. NWN's asset base would more than triple, from
$1.29 billion to about $5.65 billion. In essence, NWN's $840 mm rate base will
be joined with PGE's rate base of $1.65 billion, and NWN would have tripled its
rate base to $2.49 billion. About $780 mm of goodwill will be created in the
process. NWN is funding the deal 98% with debt and a mandatory convertible
preferred, and 2% with common equity. It will set up a new upstream corporation,
and presumably do a Section 351 acquisition. The two subsidiaries will then be
merged into "NewCo", and that name will be changed back to NWN. NWN's total
capital structure at midyear ran 47.9%-3.6%-48.6% (total debt-preferreds-common
equity). The pro forma structure should run 79.7%-6.9%-13.4%. If short-term debt
is excluded, the structure becomes 77.9%-7.5%-14.6%. Each subsidiary of NewCo
will continue with about 48%-52% leverage, but the parent will look more like an
LBO. Is this bad? We don't think so, because: (1) NWN is buying $140+ mm of
earnings and may pay out about $85 mm-$90 mm in after-tax interest expense, and
thanks to FASB 140-142, there would be no goodwill amortization; (2) Newco will
have almost entirely regulated assets; and (3) the synergies in both G&A and O&M
expenses should be noticeable. The surplus CFFO/ Profitability of (say) $50-$70
mm can be used to pay down the acquisition debt. The good news is that NWN's
earnings should be ramped up significantly as a result of this deal. The
trade-off may be that this is a one-time event, and NewCO will still be subject
to the whims of the OPUC. This should not be underestimated. NWN's realized ROEs
have been about 10.0%-10.5% recently, and PGE's have been in the 12.0%-12.5%
realized range. NWN is expected to grow at 5%-6% annually, and PGE should do
3%-4% annually.

We like the deal fit, the people fit, and the collateral benefits to ENE.

		 Subject: $2.15 bn Enron Metals Inventory Financings Closed

Last Tuesday Global Finance Europe closed  a new off balance sheet facility 
with Barclays creating up to $1bn of capacity for existing and new physical 
metals trades for Enron Metals.  This transaction will be added to through an 
additional $350mm of capacity from Credit Lyonnais and compliments the $750mm 
Warrants structure completed in September. 

Each transaction involves a sale of either Physical Metal or Warrants to the 
bank with Enron receiving an associated call option. The bank hedges its 
market risk through a  complimentary foward sale with the LME. The new 
physical metal facility will start receiving its first trades this week.     

The transaction achieves much for Enron: 
Deconsolidation of approximately $2bn of debt financed inventory which came 
with the aquisition of MG plc;
The creation of new capacity to grow the business beyond its existing base; 
Committed facilities for the business unit which are at a lower cost  than 
the original debt financed facilities;  
The creation of an additional  $2.15 bn capacity in the bank markets as the 
facilities extinguish up to 20 lines of existing credit in the banks market; 
A clearer reporting and control structure for the funding of Enron Metals.; 
A repeatable low cost structure which meets all tax and accounting tests for 
applications across all our business lines    

Congratulations to the deal team on this great effort

Gentelmen,

Following is an email detailing requests for personal contributions to 
legislators who have been instrumental to Enron regarding our power plants in 
Tennessee.  I produced this list based on recommendations from our lobbying 
firm, Stokes Bartholomew, in Nashville.

In 1999, Stokes Bartholomew, working with Jordan Mintz in Enron's tax 
department, convinced the state legislature to pass legislation clarifying 
that Enron's power plants would be exempt from the gross receipts tax.  Had 
we not succeeded in the effort, we would have had to pay gross receipts taxes 
of approximately $1.5 million per year.  

In 2000, Tennessee is one of the only states in the union that has been 
running a deficit in the general revenue fund.  Rather than going home for 
the summer, the legislature stayed in session and debated among themselves 
and with the Governor on how to solve the revenue shortfall issue.  
Eventually, they adopted unreasonably  optimistic revenue projections to 
produce a balanced budget (on paper).   This has not solved the problem 
because the state is already $100 million below revenue projections in the 
first quarter of the fiscal year.  The legislature will look for a long term 
solution when it returns in January.  Stokes Bartholomew informs me that all 
sources of revenue will be considered - this means our exemption from the 
gross receipts tax could possibly be repealed.  At this time, no one is 
singling this exemption out, but Stokes Bartholomew is cautious and is 
monitoring the issue closely.

Numerous legislators supported the gross receipts legislation for Enron.  If 
our gross receipts tax exemption is threatened next legislative session, we 
would have to return to these same legislators (if they are reelected) for 
support.  As long as Enron pays taxes in Tennessee, it behooves us to take an 
active interest in supporting those legislators who will defend our interests 
in the capitol.

Since you are the key contacts at Enron for Tennessee, I ask you to assess 
this matter and decide whether ongoing legislative support is important to 
Enron's interests in TN and make contributions accordingly.

I have recommended $9,500 in contributions.  While this seems like a large 
amount, it is miniscule in comparison to the taxes we are not paying.  
Moreover, it will go a long way to helping us protect our interests against 
those who would fight to have "big corporations", particularly out-of-state 
corporations, get stuck with additional tax burdens to solve the state's 
fiscal woes.

You are probably asking why we are not using Enron PAC funds or coroporate 
funds to make these donations.  Tennessee law prohibits us from using 
corporate funds and limits the use of PAC funds to those PACs that do not 
receive any source of support from the corporation.  Because Enron Corp. pays 
the expenses for the Enron PAC, we are not permitted to contribute Enron PAC 
funds to candidates in Tennessee.  This is one of the most onerous political 
contribution laws in the country.

If you have any questions I can be reached for the next week at 
614.306.4359.  Or you can leave a message for me at 614.760.7472.

Per our phone conversation, following is a list of key legislative leaders 
deserving of Enron's support.  This list has been developed by our 
counsel/legislative agents in Nashville: Bill Bruce, Gif Thornton and Robert 
Gowan.

Please feel free to call me to discuss further.  You can reach me on my cell 
phone this afternoon and all day tomorrow.  I will be in the office on Monday.

Lieutenant Governor: Senator John Wilder (Democrat)
$2,500
Represents Brownsville in the Senate.
Sponsor of 1999 gross receipts tax exemption legislation for Brownsville.
Has a serious opponent this November.
The Senate elects the Lieutenant Governor who also serves as the head of the 
Senate.  It is in Enron's best interst that John Wilder win the election and 
be re-elected Lieutenant Governor. 

Rep. Jimmy Naifey
$1,000
Speaker of the House
Represents Brownsvile.

Senate Candidate Larry Trail (Democrat)
$2,000
John Wilder's personal mission, besides his own election, is to get Larry 
elected to the Senate (it is an open seat that is being vacated by a 
Democrat).
If the Democrats lose this seat there is a very good chance that Senator 
Wilder will not be re-elected Lieutenant Governor because the Democrats will 
have lost the majority in the Senate.

Rep. Matt Kisber (Democrat)
$1,500
Represents the Jackson area.
Very pro-business Democrat.
Is in a very tough race because the district was redrawn and it now majority 
Republican.
Matt is the chair of the House Finance, Ways and Means Committee - which 
hears all gross receipts tax matters.
Was very helpful to Enron on the gross receipts legislation.

Senator Jerry Cooper
$1,000
Chair of the Senate Commerce Committee
His committee hears all legislation relating to energy and power plants.

Rep. Shelby Rinehart
$500
Chair of Commerce Committe (all energy and power plant issues) and powerful 
member of the House Finance and Ways and Means Committee.
He is extremely powerful.  Bill, Gif and Robert have a very good relationship 
and rely on him for assistance for their clients regularly.

Unless otherwise noted, checks should be make payable to "Friends of 
_______________".

Please forward to Bill Bruce fo personal delivery.  (or if you want to get 
them to me I can pass them along)

Story 8322 (CPN, DUK, DYN, EIX, ENE, MIR, PCG, REI, RRI, SRE, WMB, I/ELC...)
   By Mark Golden, Kristen McNamara, Jon Kamp and John Edmiston 
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
 
  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Energy trading companies have concerns about the 
credit quality of troubled Enron Corp. (ENE), but they have made almost no 
changes in policies concerning the top trader of North American power and
gas, 
the companies said Thursday. 
  The concerns have arisen because Enron, which accounts for about a quarter

of the trade in the country's power and gas markets, has seen its share
price 
fall by a third this week due to uncertainties about its extremely complex 
financial structure. 
  Moody's has put Enron's credit on watch for possible downgrade, and some
of 
the company's debt is trading like junk bonds in the secondary market this 
week. 
  "We have made no changes to our credit policy concerning Enron," said John

Sousa, chief spokesmann for Dynegy Inc. (DYN). "It's business as usual." 
  Williams Cos. (WMB) spokesman Jim Gipson said that his company, too, has 
made no changes and has no concerns about Enron's credit. Another Top 10
power 
and gas trading company, Aquila (ILA), has also left Enron credit unchanged.

  Other companies expressed concern, though they've taken little if any 
action. 
  "Like everyone else in the marketplace, we're proceeding with caution,"
said 
Lora Kinner, director of credit for Tractebel Energy Marketing, the North 
American subsidiary of the Belgian company Tractebel S.A. 
  Kinner said the company is just looking for more information and doesn't 
expect to make any drastic changes.

Our structuring and risk groups have "entered" the executed CDWR contracts into Enpower.  We have included executed contracts but not letters of intent.  There were a few contracts that did not have sufficient information to model.  We believe that we have captured 80 percent to 90 percent of value.  The attached spreadsheet shows the results by company.  The data comes directly from information released by the California state treasurer.  Since we are using Enpower to calc these deals, we can update them easily.  Let me know if you want anything else on this.

Subject:	DWR Stranded Cost Update

Using information pulled together by Jennifer and BAN, I requested West Tradings Risk/Structuring Group do a more careful analysis of the above-market costs associated with the DWR contracts.  Attached is their analysis.

In this analysis we examined only the executed contracts and NOT the agreements-in principle.  (Only executed contracts were released by the state in the last few weeks.) Also, gas-indexed contracts were examined on their nongas costs only.  Since gas costs are a pass through on some contracts, we excluded them as a conservatism; i.e., we did not ascribe costs to the gas portion of the contracts since they will float with market costs over time.  These contracts were marked to market using current, applicable curves.  Finally we discounted at the LIBOR rate, which is around 4%/year.

The stranded cost under these assumptions  is approximately $10 billion.  The spreadsheet shows the overmarket costs by contract.  Note: a negative "mark-to-market" equals a positive stranded cost.

As before, this analysis is based upon Enron's confidential forward curves.  Approval from Tim Belden is needed before this analysis can be released.

Subject:	Status CEG/CEG-Rio Transaction

Current state of play:

ASEP took the transaction off of their agenda for their October 25 meeting.  Reason was that some directors complained that the required 10 day public notice of the meeting was not given in time.

Head of ASEP has committed to Petrobras (as well as to Orlando Puppin) that the transaction will be on the agenda for a November 14 meeting and should be approved that day.  Petrobras is getting this commitment in writing and will forward to us.

The approval process is that ASEP sends a letter supporting approval to Vagner Victor.  Vagner Victor sends a letter to the Governor requesting that he issue a directive.

Petrobras has said that if they get the letters form ASEP and Vagner Victor then they will waive having to wait on the Governor issuing the directive as a condition to close.

Petrobras has assurances from ASEP and Vagner Victor that they will provide the recommendation letters soon after the November 14 meeting.

 Petrobras wants to target Monday November 19 for pre-closing and November 20 for closing in Houston.

On Monday, Richard Olm secured the approval of the Brasoil board for the transaction -- final internal approval required.

Petrobras has instructed their lawyers to meet with our lawyers next week to finalize the closing documents.

Petrobras has assured me that the money is ready offshore to complete the deal.  Petrobras has been working with us and Bank of America to set up the accounts they will need to complete the subsequent transactions.

Petrobras has their accountants in our Rio office this week to make sure they have all the documents necessary for completing the deal.

Petrobras knows that there are issues in CEG (concerning gas supply and tariffs) that are scheduled for the November CEG board meeting that they would vote yes on but that Enron would veto.  We will probably delay that vote but Petrobras realizes that a decision must be made soon in order not to affect the operations of CEG.

Neither party has the right to unilaterally terminate the transaction.  Under the PSA the transaction will terminate if not completed by December 31, 2001.


Based on input from various sources in Brazil and on the actions and demeanor of  Petrobras, my judgement is that the delay is being caused by ASEP due to bureaucracy and politics associated with this high profile transaction with a state company.    Petrobras is not acting like a company that does not want to close.  As difficult as it is, my recommendation is to extend our purchase price agreement and wait for the new target date.

We have just completed a one week transfer of trading and e-commerce 
knowledge and experiences with both Houston and London. This had been done to 
better prepare for the launch of EOL Argentina. I wanted to communicate the 
results as a reflection upon any future support or orientation we may deem 
appropriate for our activities.

The North American exchange was technically strong yet lacked any commercial 
depth, experiences or strategies applicable to an emerging energy market. The 
advanced nature of the North American energy market makes it very difficult 
to share experiences and knowledge with Argentina due to the widely different 
states of development and application of business strategies.

The European exchange was well received and very much bi directional. This is 
obviously as a result of being more closely aligned with our current state of 
evolution and in some cases Argentina is actually ahead of Europe. In that 
the Argentina energy market was designed closely in relationship to the UK 
market it is logical we have more in common and can leverage off these 
similar market experiences. Europe embraced the exchange even to the extent 
of holding a company meeting for the presentation of the Argentina business 
experience and corresponding strategy.

I believe we should seek out a stronger tie to Europe in the future and 
foster growth in our relationship to better support, facilitate and grow our 
business.

I believe you would be the grief master on this subject at least in terms of 
"you better start delivering on this stuff".  By the way the pitch to 
Colonial pipeline went okay yesterday.  Good news - Bill Scott CEO said we 
were the only company that could deliver exactly what he asked for.  Bad news 
is that he thought it should be 25% lower.  I believe his reaction is simply 
a gut reaction from a former trader and we are following up with information 
to get him better educated as to why this is a good deal for him.  We have 
$20 - $30mm in the deal and this creates roughly $70mm of value or savings 
(depending on your assumptions) for Colonial.  I believe we can get to a 
trade with them.  I'll keep you updated.

Thanks,

Subject: Are we finding value in outsourcing? - GE Plastics

This week we will begin discussions on structure and pricing with GE 
Plastics.  At the risk of getting committed to earnings delivery I thought it 
would be helpful to give a range of value to us & GE at least before the 
economics start to deteriorate in negotiations.  Currently the proposal would 
require GE to step up to ten year fixed price positions that would create the 
following split up of economics:

Savings to GE $33MM PV
Value to Enron $15MM with $10MM of this value in bookable mark to market
$40 MM in capital invested in the Demand Side Management Projects.

I think that this suggests there should be value in our outsourcing efforts.

Thanks,
Rodney

(PR); Mellencamp, Lisa; Sharp, Vicki
Subject:	California Update--08.09.01

THE LEGISLATURE
No material change from the last update.  
The Legislature is in recess and the two bills that passed the Senate--SB 78 and SB 18--continue to sit in the Assembly, waiting for the Assembly to return on August 20th.
Support for the two bills in Assembly is currently very weak.
A handful of Democratic Assembly legislators and staff have been meeting over the recess to determine whether they can 1) reach agreement on the bill that the Assembly's been working on (AB 82), and 2) reach agreement with the Democrats in the Senate.
We will distribute the output of those meetings as soon as it is available.
The key features of SB 78 would: 
allow Edison to recover $2.5 of the $3.5 B of payables. 
earmark the $2.5 B to pay the banks and the QFs.  
leave Edison to figure out how to cover the remaining $1B in payables to suppliers (including Enron).
single out the largest business customers to pay for 100% of the $2.5 B in payables.
give the State the option to buy Edison's transmission assets at book.
do nothing to ensure Direct Access is maintained.
The key features of AB 82 would:
maintain a week form of Direct Access, though the bill doesn't go nearly far enough with respect to DA.
adopt some of SB 78's the onerous features (e.g., no authorization to pay back suppliers; force the biggest business customers to pay down Edison's debt to the banks and QFs).
The key features of SB 18 would:
restructure the way in which the upcoming bond issuance is financed by creating a "dedicated utility rate component" (i.e., a fixed charge) to service the bonds.
de-link payments to suppliers holding DWR contracts from payments to service the bonds to pay back the General Fund.
allow the PUC to hold a public hearing on DWR's contracts.

A consortium of small and large businesses and business associations sent a strongly worded letter today to Davis and all members of the CA Legislature expressing extreme opposition to both 78 and 82.  I have a copy of the letter and will distribute to anyone who would like to see it.
In the same letter, the business consortium strongly supports SB 18 because they fear they will get stuck with any out-of-the-money DWR contracts.
The consortium is lobbying hard to have the DWR contracts nullified or re-negotiated.
The Treasurer and the Governor oppose SB 18 because they believe 1) it would constitute contract breach, and 2) the contract provisions require the state to pay the present value of the contract plus LD in the event of a breach.
Calpine, who holds about 50% of the DWR contract volume, is also opposed to SB 18.
Opposition to any form of "Edison bailout" is increasing among policy makers, opinion leaders and the press
There is currently a 50-50 or better chance that the Legislature will NOT pass an Edison MOU before the session ends, though that could change.

THE CALIFORNIA PUC
Since the legislature has failed to pass comprehensive legislation addressing CA's crisis, the issues now revert back to the PUC.
In particular, the PUC is slated to rule on August 23rd on whether Direct Access should be suspended.
The Treasurer has said that DA must be suspended in order to remove any risk that DA might create with respect to impairing the revenue stream necessary to service the bonds.
AB 1X, the law that authorized DWR to buy power, gives the PUC the authority to suspend Direct Access.
Enron is leading a large group of customers and suppliers in an effort to stop the PUC from suspending Direct Access.
The group is writing a letter to Davis, the PUC, the Treasurer, DWR and the Legislature urging them to maintain Direct Access.
That letter should be released Friday or Monday.
The group is also making a submission to the PUC as early as Monday to provide the Commission with practical alternatives that would permit the the PUC to maintain Direct Access.
The group is also mounting a PR campaign that it wil launch simultaneously with the release of the letter and the submission to the PUC.
Currently, the chances that the PUC will suspend Direct Access on the 23rd is better than 50 percent, but a considerable effort is underway to reverse the situation.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact me at 415.782.7822. If I've missed anyone, please forward along.		

Best,
Jeff

                            October 25, 2001
********************************************************************************

Balance sheet issues at Enron (ENE, $16.41, NR) have triggered investor concerns
regarding non-payment of receivables held by trading counter-parties like
Calpine, Dynegy, Mirant, and NRG.

We do not believe any trading counter party to Enron has a daily value-at-risk
(VAR) of more than $100 million and most company risk management controls are
considerably more restrictive.

We estimate that the majority of trading counter parties have exposure of
roughly one month of receivables to Enron which we believe would be in the low
hundreds of millions of dollars range at worst.

********************************************************************************

The market is concerned that potential cash flow issues at Enron could spread to
other wholesale energy marketers and IPPs.  Concerns have surfaced that trading
counter-parties might restrict Enron's trading access or require additional
credit to support its wholesale energy trading business.  Unsubstantiated rumors
suggest that some counter-parties may have cut off Enron's credit.  The concern
is that a potential liquidity crunch at Enron could ultimately lead to
non-payment of receivables held by trading counter-parties like Calpine, Dynegy,
Mirant or NRG.  While we agree that, in the event of a worst case outcome, some
of the uncertainties related to Enron's financing needs could have credit
implications for its trading partners, in our opinion a multitude of negative
events would have to occur before Enron's receivables might be deemed
uncollectible.

Counter-party risk is largely limited to trade receivables and not open market
positions.  We know of no industry counter-parties to Enron that have a daily
value-at-risk (VAR) of more than $100 million and most risk management controls
are considerably less.  Enron represents a relatively small proportion of each
counter-parties' daily VAR due to concentration controls.  Therefore, daily VAR
related to Enron should be limited.  The greater potential credit risk lies
within the trade receivables each counter-party might have with Enron.  Trading
receivables are typically collected within 30-35 days of the trade date.  We
believe few counter-parties would have materially more than a single month's
worth of trading exposure to Enron at any given time.  We believe that most
counter-parties would have at most a couple of hundred million dollars of
receivable exposure to Enron per month.  We would expect few of Enron's trading
partners' businesses to be seriously jeopardized as a result of a potential
Enron default.

Yesterday, the stocks of some of Enron's chief counter-parties fell
precipitously.   Dynegy fell the most, declining $5.45 or almost 13%.  Dynegy
clearly is a large counter-party to Enron's trading desk, but we doubt that the
magnitude of Dynegy's receivables risk to Enron is remotely equal to the $1.8
billion of market capitalization that Dynegy lost yesterday.  Mirant's stock
price fell $1.53 or 5.3%, reflecting a decline in market capitalization of over
$500 million.  We believe that the energy marketers as a whole have more
exposure to Enron's trading desk than the IPPs.  Calpine and NRG are
significantly smaller counter-parties to Enron than the larger energy marketers.
Calpine disclosed in its second quarter 10-Q that it transacted over $300
million in the first half of 2001 with Enron.  Assuming that Calpine's
receivable exposure was equally distributed monthly and currently running at a
similar rate, Calpine's receivable exposure to Enron would equal only about $50
million.  Calpine's market value dropped over $600 million yesterday.  None of
the counter-parties we spoke to over the last couple of days would disclose
their current receivables exposure to Enron.  In our opinion, the uncertainty of
the amounts in question have contributed to an over-reaction by the market to
the potential risks involved.

Hello Andy.

It's been a long time since we talked, but I trust that things are well with
you and Lea.

The reason for my email is that my business partners Sunil Hirani and Dik
Blewitt are going to be in Houston visiting with Ken Lay at 10:30 A.M. on
Wednesday.  I think that you would find their business (trading credit risk)
to be of interest, and I know they would like to meet you.

Would you have any time on your calendar for lunch or for an introduction
during the afternoon?

Briefly,  Sunil is the co-founder of creditex, a the credit derivatives
trading platform that the market has adopted as the e-market for credit
derivatives.  Dik is Chief Strategic Officer of creditex.

My relationship with Dik and Sunil comes from our shared interest in trading
syndicated loans.  creditex and I have co-founded LoanX, Inc., to do for the
loan market what creditex has done for the credit derivatives market.

Sorry for the out-of-the blue email, but I look forward to catching up with
you in the future.

I've copied Sunil and Dik to facilitate any schedule coordination that might
be possible.

My best to Lea.

Subject: Transportation Status

Scott Neal told me that you asked recently where we stood on development of a 
transportation market in light of 637.  I would be happy to meet with you and 
let you know in more detail what I have been working on, but here is a quick 
synopsis.

We are putting new transportation products out on EOL--this should be ready 
for December business (assuming Lavo has no objections--I just sent him the 
information on the product).  They are simple products with no computerized 
interaction between EOL and Sitara or EOL and the pipeline bulletin boards 
(which we are still required to post through per the pipeline tariffs).  
Quite honestly, I have no idea how much activity these will generate since 
each product still has the potential for being "biddable" on the pipeline 
EBBs and there is not an easy solution around that.  Also, all completed 
transactions still must be posted on the EBBs and confirmed by the pipelines 
before the deal is actually completed.  This product does not make the 
release process any simpler; however, it does make it more visible by having 
bids and offers out on EOL, where people are more likely to be looking than 
the pipeline EBB.

The vision is to have the entire bidding and confirmation process through the 
EBBs automated, which would encourage a significant increase in trading 
activity for transportation, but there are several important infrastructure 
steps we must take first--you know, minor things like creating a 
transportation position screen in Sitara and getting the pipelines' EDI 
(Electronic Data Interchange) mechanisms in working form.  We are in testing 
with 9 pipelines as of today.

Also, as I'm sure you are aware, Julie Gomez is working with several 
pipelines to put their available IT (interruptible) space out on EOL (the 
last I heard this should happen for January business), and then I understand 
that she plans to work with EOL to allow third parties to put transportation 
bids and/or offers out on EOL in an "Altra-like" system--meaning ENA will not 
always be a party to those transactions.  

There are many changes occurring because of Order 637, but the pipelines are 
still going through their compliance filings and there are alot of complaints 
about those filings--which just means more time for implementation.

If you have any questions, please call me at x35514.

Subject: Catalytica

Catalytica filed a prospectus supplement with the SEC yesterday, December 
11th which disclosed that because of recent market conditions the Board had 
decided not to proceed with the planned stock split prior to the spin-off.  
The supplement indicates an expected initial trading range "at a price 
between $20 and no less than $10 per share".   Based upon these new 
Catalytica's estimates, the value of the Enron investment would be $13.5 to 
$27.0 million.  Enron's Catalytica investment is part of the raptor structure 
so that the impact is on raptor capacity rather than earnings.  The 
investment has also been monetized in a FAS 125 structure for cash flow 
purposes.

The purpose of this e-mail is to bring everyone in the loop on activities on the west desk that we are undertaking to preserve as much value in our book as possible.  I realize that our efforts to date have not been communicated to all internal people who need to know what we are doing.  My apologies for this.  Hopefully this e-mail will accomplish that goal.

A number of counterparties in the west have not yet terminated our deals and have benefited from our inability to procure power in the market to serve these deals.  As a result, we haven't been delivering on several contracts that are deep in the money.  Our counterparties have no motivation to terminate our contracts because such a termination would force them to write us a substantial check.  Instead, these counterparties have been happy to not receive high priced power from us and are filling their positions in the market at much lower prices.

We have taken the limited supplies that we are still receiving and delivering these limited supplies to the highest price sales contracts that we have.  We now have the ability to prepay for additional supplies in order to fulfill additional pre-petition obligations that have not yet been terminated that are in the money.  We have received approval from the Cash committee for purchases through December 27th (I think) and we will secure additional cash to continue on.

Here are the procedures as I understand them.  If you have any questions or modifications please me an e-mail or give me a call.

Cash Desk
Each cash desk needs to identify all transactions in its region that have not been terminated.
On a counterparty by delivery point basis we need to assess whether the weighted average of all near term (next day to next week) deliveries with that counterparty are in the money.
If the average of all transactions with that counterparty at a given location are in the money, we should submit a request for and endeavor to serve the entire portfolio of deals with that counterparty at that delivery point.  We are of the opinion now that we will not be able to cherry pick deals with one counterparty at the same location.
The cash desks should prepare a two week view of the positions that we will need to fill and an estimate (based on spot market prices) of the cash that we will need to serve these transactions to Steve Thome.
The cash desk should provide a daily list of prepay deals that have been done to John Postlethwaite via e-mail.
The cahs desk should provide a list of all historic prepays done so far to bring John current.

Marketing Desk
Steve Thome will coordinate the cash approval process for the west desk.
The marketing desk is responsible for lining up counterparties who will be willing to supply us on a prepay basis.
The marketing desk should direct any legal questions from sellers to Steve Hall/Christian Yoder.
Make sure that sellers fax a copy of the confirmation letter to Steve Hall/Christian Yoder at (503) 464-8058.
The marketing desk needs to work with the cash desk to buy power on a spot basis.  We don't necessarily care who buys it, but rather, we want to ensure that we receive the best price and that all purchases are communicated.
Whoever secures a supply needs to communicate the need for cash to Steve Thome.

Deal Entry
The new deals need to be entered in a manner that will be possible to settle.  After discussing the matter with Stacey White, she recommended entering the new deals in Enpower as zero price, non MTM, with an annuity equal to the prepay amount.
We should enter notes into Enpower indicating that these are prepay transactions.
This will allow settlements to match an annuity in Enpower with prepay out the door.  It will also prevent them from paying the counterparty twice.

I'm sure that I've missed something.  Let me know.

Regards,
Tim

As we move forward in the planning stages for NETCO we need to identify all systems which need to be moved or copied into the entity.  We have identified the great majority of the systems to be moved but we may not be able to identify particular tools used by your group or you individually.  This would include spreadsheets etc.

Please send lists of systems and software required to Anne Koehler by close of business today.

To be clear we can (subject to the negotiation) move/copy systems and some data however, we CANNOT move either transaction data if counterparty specific or data obtained from a counterparty under a confidentiality agreement.

For Houston traders, Geof Storey is compiling your lists.

Thanks

Subject: Re: Basic  

Dave, I agree with your perspective on this.  Building another theoretical 
model in the Basic situation seems naive to me.  This company is and has been 
in a financial death spiral.  For months, all involved on the ENA side have 
been focused on a probability that the Basic situation would result in a 
writeoff of a very significant piece of the Merlin debt and nothing for the 
equity.  The deal we are working on is at the high end of the projections 
reviewed with the rating agencies on recovery for the Merlin debt and 
actually gets us at least some chance of recovery on our equity.

I do not agree that no effort has been made to market the company.  As you 
recall, we worked very intensively in trying to support an IPO which would 
take out the debt.  Despite many attempts to structure a successful offering 
(and a series of difficult concessions by Enron), the IB finally pulled it.  
The S-1, by the way, was about the ugliest I have ever seen.

We carefully evaluated seeking an industry purchaser.  Our conclusion was 
that this risked losing significant value, would require a good deal of time, 
and had virtually no likelihood of equalling the recovery we have would 
achieve if we can do the deal on the table.   This evaluation was reinforced 
with the contacts we have had with industry players.

In any liquidation there is always the possibility that another path could 
possibility capture more value.  In this case especially, I think we have a 
very good idea of reality and are making an uniformed decision to recommend a 
better-than-exected exit.  This is not a firesale.

We will continue to work constructively with RAC in a non-confrontational 
mode on Basic.  Be assured, however, that if I feel there is a real risk of 
process getting in the way of achieving our objectives, I will raise a red 
flag.  Dick.

Rick, I disagree - the DASH had an implication unsubstantiated that the 
current deal on the table is a bad one.  I believe that RAC should provide a 
clear opinion or say directly that the analysis is deficient.

It is too easy to state the obvious.

In my opion this DASH did exactly what it was supposed to do - prompt a 
dialog on whether we are getting an adequate price for this asset. My 
understanding is that no model was built to value an alternative nor was 
there any effort to market the company. If we want to "take the money and 
run" (whhich in this case is probably the right decision) fine, but we should 
know what we are leaving behind, especially given the current commodity price 
environment.  Rick

Subject:	Third Quarter Review of Northern and Transwestern

	
FYI, 

Andersen has agreed that they will be able to issue review reports on the pipelines based on the following terms:

1.  The review opinions must be restricted to the lenders only.
2.  There must be a substantial footnote on the "overhang" issues (i.e., SEC investigation, potential bankruptcy, asset carryvalues in certain situations, etc.)
3.  The review opinion will contain an emphasis of matter paragraph related to the above footnote.
4.  ENE management rep and O/S legal must rep that nothing they are working on (related to investigation) affects the pipelines or its management.
5.  Pipelines must represent that it is not involved in any of the matters under investigation.

In addition to the above, AA  believes that they must expand their review work in order to satisfy themselves related to the issues and reps required above.

In connection with all of this, the banks need these reviews completed by the closing date which is currently expected to be November 9.



I believe that the following are our immediate to do's in order to get Andersen started:

1.  Ene to provide full quarterly statements of Northern and Transwestern to Andersen ASAP.
2.  Discuss w/ Willard/Duncan the level of detail/analysis that they will need to perform review.
3.  Provide necessary PBC schedules, etc.
4.  Draft the footnote discussed in 2. above and get approved by Rick and Legal
5.  Get Andersen to draft the language they would like to see in rep letters.  Get approved by Rick/ Legal.



As to each of the above to do's, 

Gary  - can you contact the pipeline group as soon as you get in this morning and see if the financial statements for the 3Q have already been put together.  If they have not, we need to get them produced ASAP.  They have already been put on notice that these statements will be a priority.  Also, lets see what type of support they typically provide to AA for their quarterly financial reveiws.   I assume the scopes will now be much lower since the reviews are on stand alone pipes instead of ENE Consol.

Bob - can you call Saunders and fill him in?  Once I get in I want to talk to Duncan and Willard about #2, #4 and #5 above. You are welcome to be a part of those discussions.  Also we should discuss what we believe the appropriate scopes to be.

Rick - Any thoughts on the above Andersen requirements?  Other thoughts?

If I have missed any critical steps that you can think of, please let me know.

It is now 4:00 a.m.  I plan to be in by around 10:00 a.m.  If you need me for any reason call me at home (832-593-8065).  Thanks.

Tim,

John's communication regarding not updating December was in order to complete December liquidations for accounting and settlements last week.  However, we were then informed that settlements would not draft their billing until the 14th of January so we then retracted our 'hold' on updating December schedule.  Any updates that can be made in order for settlements to get the most accurate data would be most appreciated.

In addition, the cash flow forecast (as indicated by Don) will be coordinated through Kristin.  I do not believe you will have to do any work for this as all the data will come from our risk calculations and true settlement information.  

Thanks,
Stacey

Subject:	RE: Dec and Jan liquidations

Yesterday I was approached by Steve Thome who had been asked by Brandon Wax (who was asked by Don Miller?) looking for a cash forecast for deals that flowed in December.  While I'd like to be helpful, I have never done a cash forecast before.  We don't have the tools set up in Portland to do this sort of thing.  The data to do this has historically resided in Enpower.  A week ago the West Power desk met and agreed that we were able to and prepared to update Enpower in "Schedule" for all of the deals that flowed in December.  Diana Scholtes sent an e-mail (below) to Leslie Reeves on January 3rd indicating that we were prepared to update Enpower.  We heard from John Postlethwaite that Leslie didn't want us to update Schedule -- instead they could work off of our trade sheets.

I don't care which way we move forward.  It just seems that we aren't all on the same page.  We just want to do whatever needs to be done to get the right information to the right people.  Exerience tells me that we are better off doing it "right" the first time.  I am hoping that between Don, Leslie, and Stacey we can get some clear direction on what you would like us to do.  As of now, there is little I can do to assist Brandon with his request for a cash flow projection.

Tim

It has come to my attention that there seems to be miscommunication between various groups and people about how Dec and Jan scheduling for non-terminated deals should be handled. There are conflicting reports that Houston, through the estate, will handle updating scheduling in Enpower or that the scheduling group should be updating Enpower accordingly.

What I am hoping for is that by whatever communications means necessary we can come to a final action plan on how to clean this and get Enpower up to date as quickly and as accurately as possible.

Thanks,

Leslie,

I'm trying to get a jump on making sure we have everything done properly in Enpower for the month of January.  My question is whether we, the West desk, should enter any changes in Enpower due to OUR non-delivery and/or incremental deals?  We have everything recorded on our Trade sheets, but if it would make it easier for you to settle or relay to the Estate by us making the changes in Deal Scheduling, we can do so.  

I also understand, after talking to John, you will be using our Trade sheets for such changes for the month of December.  I'm not sure who you would like us to assist in translating our sheets, but if you can call me, we can set up a conference call and I'll coordinate from each desk to attend.  

If there is anything else that you need us to do to help your group please let me know.

Tim, I thought I would send you a copy of the East Mid-Market QBR to give you 
a view on what Presto/Baughman are doing.  The West historically has been far 
better than the East in covering the market and generating mid market 
deals/services.  I look forward to our discussion in Portland next week.  I 
would like to get a perspective on organization, market approach, deal flow, 
resources, products and coverage for the Mid-Market group at that meeting.

Fellas,

Presto has asked me to be the contact to Allan Stewart at PIRA with regard to setting up an arrangement for their consulting services.  I'm currently having information-gathering discussions over services and fees for both gas and power, in both the east and west.  In order to fully incorporate everyone's needs into our arrangement with PIRA, I'll be contacting you this week to gather requests.  Or, if you know what you need, please just reply to me with the specific information.

Thanks,

The attached letter is being delivered this morning to the FERC 
commissioners.  Since the letter concerns a matter currently pending before 
the commission it will also be served on the parties.  We plan to talk to the 
press about it as well.  A number of other companies and organizations are 
also submitting letters and we have helped prepare an EPSA filing which 
focusses specifically on California.  Our best information at this point is 
that the FERC staff report regarding California is generally accurate, and 
therefore, favorable.  While it will mention periodic exercises of market 
power, it is expected to lay blame for California's woes at the feet of 
California's own decisions about market structure.  It is further expected 
that the report will not provide a basis for ordering refunds.  On the other 
hand, the Commission's order (to be considered tomorrow along with the 
staff's report) is expected to at least put refunds on the table for comment 
and to discuss, and perhaps implement, further price caps.  This is just our 
best guess at this point.  the Commission has put special emphasis on putting 
the report and order under wraps until wednesday.

Kevin, given the track record of mis-behaviour, I don't fault you with the premise of guilt before understanding.  But I would like to assure you that despite the high valuations externally, which I probably agree are fantasy, The Facility Services Group has a clear vision/market; it has a quality management team; it will be under my thumb and it is conservatively valued in the books.  It is much more that a Blockbuster or other like structure.  If you would like to discuss in detail do not hesitate to give me a call and I will take you through it - both overall strategy and tactics.  Even though it has been a confluence of events which has caused our problems, the fundamental root of most issues is an inactive management team which hasn't managed the detail as well as we would like.  New Power in my view would not have been as big a loser if we had kept it private and managed it closely as a key part of the business.  Instead we took it public and let it run amok.  I think you can see parallels across the company.  Initially well intentioned and thought out strategies fall apart when not managed appropriately.

Regards
Delainey

Subject: Are we finding value in outsourcing? - GE Plastics

This week we will begin discussions on structure and pricing with GE 
Plastics.  At the risk of getting committed to earnings delivery I thought it 
would be helpful to give a range of value to us & GE at least before the 
economics start to deteriorate in negotiations.  Currently the proposal would 
require GE to step up to ten year fixed price positions that would create the 
following split up of economics:

Savings to GE $33MM PV
Value to Enron $15MM with $10MM of this value in bookable mark to market
$40 MM in capital invested in the Demand Side Management Projects.

I think that this suggests there should be value in our outsourcing efforts.

Thanks,
Rodney

Dave,

A DASH will be circulating later today for approximately $16MM for $10MM of 
progress payments on a 7FA and certain development costs for our Longview 
Project.  Chip Schneider and I have agreed that this approach allows us to 
get to NTP on the project (up until August 20), or determine a higher-valued 
use for the turbine in the event the development does not get finalized for 
some reason.  Given the strength of the PNW market, this project is in the 
money using Enron mid curves for gas and power.  

Mike Miller has appropriately backed away - my team is engaged directly with 
GE on the contract negotiation and a term sheet is expected to be signed 
tomorrow.
I am highly confident that this will result in a 2001 gain of $15MM-$20MM.   

I was planning to talk with Louise about this at our call this morning.  Are 
you or she the appropriate signor for EA?  I will also contact Mark Frevert 
early this afternoon to discuss.   

Regards,

Chris

Subject: NBP unit reaction to DeRoin/Cordes announcement

The market received the announcement of Larry's retirement and Bill's 
succession very calmly.   I talked to each of our analysts and elaborated a 
bit on the news and answered their questions:
 - Why is Larry leaving?  Was there any "hidden" reason? 
 -  What is Bill's background?
 - Does this signal any change in strategy or direction from Enron?
 - Do we anticipate any other change in the business as a result of this 
management change?

Several said that "since this seems to not be a big change (in direction or 
strategy), I'm not going to write anything on it".


The unit price did not reflect much change.   The units opened Monday (the 
day of the news) at $29, blipped up some 3/16  just after the press release, 
and then settled back to the opening price.   Tuesday opened strong, trended 
up $.50 in heavy volume and then again settled to $29.   Wednesday's price 
closed up 1/16, at $29.0625.

Daily volumes were:  Monday 27,400 units
            Tuesday 50,200 units
                 Wednesday 20,800 units

We were hoping to communicate that this would be a fairly seamless transition 
and continue NBP's history of solid, fairly conservative management, and it 
appears that the market interpretted it exactly that way.

Dave, I still believe that the most flexible model that provides high ROCE 
and has growth not constrained by capital is the one being employed by 
Enron.  I think the cash on cash returns on these Genco's in the short run 
will be good; however, I think it will be difficult for these companies to 
move quickly to react to market opportunities given their need to protect 
their long position (not unlike our friends in the oil & gas producing 
sector).  The returns and value provided by these companies will be primarily 
be based on the timing of new production and their asset base and they will 
realize (on a relative basis) very little from the trading.

It is not a bad model just a different one.

Either way, they will be  a strong bid for assets given their story to Wall 
Street.

David:  This is a very intersting article for you to consider when the 
management considers what businesses Newco should include.  This article 
suggests that a combination of physical assets and trading are best.  That 
may  be true for US and Europe markets, but maybe not for lesser developed 
countries.

Analyst: Koch Venture Adds Value To Entergy-FPL Merger
By Bryan Lee
  
08/10/2000 
Dow Jones Energy Service 
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 

OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- The trading venture between Entergy Corp. (ETR) and 
Koch Industries will get a big boost from the utility's planned merger with 
FPL Group (FPL), marrying trading floor expertise with a commanding array of 
power plant assets.

So says Diane Borska, director of the utilities and energy practice at 
Cambridge, Mass.-based Fuld Inc., a consulting firm specializing in 
"competitive intelligence." 
In April, Entergy and Koch formed a joint venture to trade electricity and 
natural gas. 

The Koch joint venture is "the real killer thing about this merger," Borska 
said in an interview, in which she elaborated on her observations in a "white 
paper" analyzing the Entergy-FPL transaction. 

Once completed, the merger will put the combined company at the vanguard of 
competitive energy companies seeking convergence between physical assets and 
trading floor and risk management expertise, Borska said. 

Many companies are strong in trading floor and risk management expertise, but 
lack physical assets they can leverage in competitive electricity markets, 
Borska observed. 

On the other hand, utilities are rich in physical assets, but lack trading 
floor expertise, she said. 

In the past, "the people who have excelled have not necessarily had physical 
assets," Borska said. 

But in the future, "the people who are going to dominate are going to have 
both huge national asset portfolios and top-tier trading and risk management 
expertise," she said. "It's not going to one or the other." 

Koch has been in the top 20 in terms of trading energy. But adding the 
tremendous portfolio of power plant assets involved in the Entergy-FPL merger 
will undoubtedly bump Koch's trading into the top 10 or top five, Borska 
predicted. 

The stock transaction valued at $7 billion will bring together 48,000 
megawatts of power generation capacity, creating the nation's largest 
electric utility company with 6.3 million customers. 

Included in that staggering generation portfolio are 10,000 megawatts of 
so-called "merchant" power plants, which solely sell wholesale energy into 
competitive bulk-power markets, rather than serve a retail customer base. 

These competitive-market merchant plants are geographically dispersed in a 
complementary way, distributed among five regional power market hubs in the 
Northeast and mid-Atlantic, Southeast, Midwest, Gulf South and Western 
states, Borska noted. 

The two companies' existing development pipeline would triple the existing 
10,000 megawatts merchant generating capacity, and plans call for growing the 
business into a 70,000-megawatt merchant-plant portfolio, Borska noted. 

"Additions to the fleet will come from additional nuclear power plant 
acquisitions and from green-field development of gas-fired plants," Borska 
noted in her white paper analysis of the transaction. 

The companies will be able to piggy-back onto Koch's 10,000-mile network of 
pipelines to supply their planned gas-fired power plant additions, Borska 
noted. 

The merger, when combined with the access to gas supply and trading-floor 
expertise of Koch, should cause investors to re-examine the higher valuations 
given pure-play generation companies compared to generation-rich combination 
companies, Borska said. 

AES Corp. (AES) and Calpine Corp. (CPN) have huge market valuations, but 
aren't known for engaging in "large, deep trading," she said. 

"Their ability to fully leverage their assets in the marketplace has been 
limited," Borska said. 

The Entergy merger with FPL, when considered in light of the Koch joint 
venture, "raises the bar for a Calpine or an AES" to gain the capability to 
leverage their significant physical assets, Borska said. 

Other energy companies, such as Dynegy (DYN) and Duke Energy (DUK), marry 
significant generation assets with trading floor sophistication, Borska 
conceded. 

But they aren't on the same scale or geographic scope as the Entergy-FPL-Koch 
combination, she said.

Dave,

Short answer is "no".

Long answer:

Has had bad chemistry with some of the folks down there.  Maybe not all his 
fault...I do not have enough data.

He wants to push Brazil as important Wholesale market (ie pulp & paper, ags, 
metals).  I think this is sound and worth looking at.  But I think this 
should be looked at by those groups.  They set their priorities.  If they 
want to pay for him being down there, we can house him and coordinate etc.  
But I am going back to basics with energy and can not afford someone pushing 
something for the good of Enron on my P/L.  Probably narrow minded, but 
hopefully pragmatic on my part.

I used him last to interface with Networks.  He is pretty fast out of the 
chute (market analysis, who's who in country etc.), but then levels off 
before tangible bottom line contribution (during my observation period 
anyway.)

Probably more of a "think tank" guy and the "think tank" ain't in Brazil. 
(especially post reorg)

So is he worth keeping for Enron?  I say yes, in the right role.  (worked for 
Cargill previously with Risk Management experience)  Does he fit with Enron 
Americas in South America?  I say no and have told him as much.

Call if you need more.

Thanks,

Kish

Mark/Greg, 

Please confirm your interest and availability to set aside 30 minutes, or so 
Dec 6, 7 or 8, for me in Houston this week.

I am in a final phase of an expat re-assignment or relocation and would like 
to discuss with you:

Enron's pricing, structuring and position-taking capability for South America 
etc.,.. expected to be in place from the year 2000, at least in power in 
Brazil.

Failure/Successes and immediate opportunities in the Enron Brazil and South 
America core (gas, power) and multiple commodity commercial effort(s), 
including e-business/Networks issues.

Finance expertise  - the critical role that functional groups like Enron 
Metals' (Trade and Structure Finance Group) and the Global Markets 
Insurance/Global Risk groups will (need to) play in helping develop critical, 
internal Enron finance, risk assessment and mitigation expertise to support 
the competitiveness and viability of closing commercial transactions in South 
America and elsewhere

My priority to help form and be re-assigned to a "Bundle Products" 
Origination business unit  designed to initiate transactions which 
specifically and formally leverage synergies across Enron Business Units - to 
potentially include in Brazil, at least, power, pulp & paper, steel networks, 
crude and products, and insurance/global risk. 

Please find attatched files which detail some of my ideas for developing the 
core gas and power trading and origination efforts and including the Bundled 
Product unit.   The files were appropriately forwarded to Dave/John. 




I have also attatched my CV should you be interested to review my background 
and experience and  mention, as a reminder, that a meeting is critical in 
potentially determining the outcome of my expat re-assignment or re-location 
process,  needed to be concluded this month, Dec 2000.  

Thank you for any efforts extended in my behalf.

Subject: Emissions - Mass. power plants

E&E Newsline - May 11, 2000

MASSACHUSETTS POWER PLANTS AGREE TO SIGNIFICANT UPGRADES

     Massachusetts this week announced that its six highest-polluting
power plants will voluntarily upgrade their pollution control technology to
not only significantly reduce air pollution but to also put the old
facilities under the same standards as new facilities.

     The action makes Massachusetts the first state to require older
plants to meet the same emissions standards as new facilities. The reduced
emissions will be in place as soon as 2003, according to Massachusetts
Governor Paul Cellucci's (R) office.

     The state approached the six plants and asked them to either reduce
their emissions or face regulatory action by the Department of
Environmental Protection. Cellucci said, "We challenged these power plants
to clean up their act, and they have answered our call to meet the most
comprehensive air emissions standards in the United States."

     The agreement -- which the five operators of the six plants agreed
to with the state -- is voluntary, but enforceable rules will follow.

     Lieutenant Governor Jane Swift explained that the agreement
resulted through "cooperative efforts," but added, "We will pursue new
regulations through the Department of Environmental Protection to ensure
the plant owners' commitments are enforceable, and will require the
finalization of a detailed plan for each of the six facilities."

     The regulations, which are expected to be proposed in the next few
months -- will set standards of 1.5 ponds of nitrogen oxide and 3 pounds of
sulfur dioxide per megawatt-hour.

     The five companies -- including Sithe Energies, Inc., NRG Energy
Inc., PE&E, Western Massachusetts Electric Companies/ Northeast Utilities,
and Southern Company/Southern Energy New England, LLC -- have submitted
preliminary plans. Under the plans, nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide
emissions would be slashed by up to 50 percent, and mercury, particulate
and carbon dioxide pollution would be curbed.

     "Our Air Quality Improvement Plan demonstrates that environmental
excellence works in today's competitive market," said James McGowan, senior
vice president of Sithe. "This is a win-win program that will produce the
best power plant for Sithe, the local communities and the environment as a
whole."

     The statement counters many other utilities' position on the issue,
particularly the Midwestern coal-fired plants subject to a massive EPA
enforcement action initiated late last year to have the facilities use
upgraded pollution control technology. Specifically, the lawsuit charges
the utilities with noncompliance with New Source Review requirements of the
Clean Air Act.

     The Massachusetts situation "does undercut the arguments of
dirtier, Midwestern companies that claim it can't be done," said Frank
O'Donnell, with Clean Air Trust.

     Pat Hemlepp, spokesperson for American Electric Power, one of the
utilities involved in the EPA lawsuit, argued, however, "that is like
comparing apples to oranges."

     Though Northeastern states blame the Midwest for pollution
migrating in their air, Hemlepp explained that since there are no serious
problems with non-attainment with CAA regulation in the Midwest, stricter
controls on utilities operating in that part of the country are
unnecessary. "States like Massachusetts have every right to go in and ask
utilities within their state to upgrade. There are major non-attainment
problems in the Northeast, so it makes sense," Hemlepp argued.

     And about EPA's lawsuit, "What people overlook is that EPA's
lawsuit is not about emissions, it's about what is and isn't legal under
the Clean Air Act. ... We feel very strongly that what we've done is
legal," Hemlepp said.

Subject: PSCO

Dave,

Wanted to give you a heads up...

We are looking at a DASH for approximately $1.5MM for development of PSCO.  
This includes cancellation charges of approximately $350K and soft 
engineering/consulting costs through November 30 (expected receipt of air 
permit).  The plan would be to DASH with Board/Exec Committee approval the 
entire project in November.   Chip Schneider of RAC is OK with this approach 
given his understanding of the project risks and economics.  

The plan is to keep this off balance sheet through West LB -> Turbo Park  
with exit to a third party no later than Sep 30, 2001.  there is likely a 
need to bring in LJM to cover $2-3MM of hard costs (moving dirt) from Dec 1 
through Jan 31.

We are planning on executing the PPA with PSCO this week - it has sufficient 
conditions precedent to give ENA Legal (and me) comfort that we can walk if 
there is any problem with permits or site costs (land, water, transmission, 
fuel).  In addition, there is a Board out that ENA Legal drafted, negotiated 
and feels is a tangible out (unlike most Board outs).  We will have a 
definitive deal with NEPCO prior to execution of the PSCO PPA.  I spoke  with 
Jacoby and  Janet and told them we are planning to take the remaining two 
LM6000's for this project.

I am available to talk about it at your convenience.

Regards,

Chris

Subject: PSCO

Chip,

PSCO has modified their position and has accepted some of our negotiating 
points (heat rate, board out, permit conditions precedent) and will accept a 
6-LM6000 project with a June 2001 start date.  The additional two LM6000's 
materially improves our economics as both installed cost/kw and fixed o&m 
decrease.  We plan on executing the PPA later this week (Monday 10/16 latest) 
with inclusion of project permitting conditions and Board-out language 
drafted by and satisfactory to ENA Legal.

In order to hit the June 01 deadline, we must order the following additional 
equipment through West LB ASAP:

6 stacks  $1,188,000
3 Control Modules $375,000
1 CEMS  $675,000
4 230kv Breakers $340,000
Total:   $2,578,000

The above equipment is needed for our remaining LM6000's in any project.  
More importantly, the cancellation charges for the above equipment are 
minimal as follows:

Now through November 1:    $257,800
Now through November 30:  $340,000 (additional $83,000)

Additional soft costs prior to mobilization in December are estimated at:

EE&CC Tasking Letter Year to Date:  $175,000
EE&CC/NEPCO Engineering through October 20:  $75,000
EE&CC/NEPCO Engineering through Nov 30: $700,000

Based on the above, I will exceed $500K around October 18.  Given our Board 
approval flexibility from PSCo and the timing of expediting the equipment 
orders, I thought it might be a good idea to seek approval for a development 
project through the end of November (or perhaps December 15). The amount 
might be $1.5MM which allows for equipment cancellation and engineering 
costs.  That would allow us to move forward aggressively and prepare a more 
complete final project approval for the next regularly scheduled Board / Exec 
Committe meeting in November.

How does this sound to you?

Regards,

Chris

The Approval Amount for the Inga DASH has been revised from $98 million to

existing credit support facilities provided by the seller, A. Ahlstrom, or 
the target, Ahlstrom Development Corporation ("ADC").  Although not explicit, 
this requirment may arise as A.Ahlstrom/ADC attempt to obtain 
"change-in-ownership" consents from partners, lenders and lessors to complete 
Enron's acquisition of ADC.  As we believe that the liklihood of this 
requirement occuring is greatest with regard to 1) and 2) below, the DASH 
reflects the aggregate of these amounts.  The requirement with regard to 3) 
below lies with an ADC subsidiary and should not "reasonably" merit 
replacement by Enron.

This change was reflected in the DASH mailed to the Finance Committee of the 
BoD on 12/05/00.

The potential credit support facilities are detailed as follows:

1)  Panther Creek -- A. Ahlstrom Comfort Letter:  A. Ahlstrom provided a  
"comfort letter" for the benefit of the lenders at the Panther Creek 
project.  Upon acquisition by Enron, the beneficiaries of this comfort letter 
may require that it be replaced by an ENE guaranty.  The comfort letter 
requires A. Ahlstrom to provide up to $1.5 MM in additional equity to the 
project in the event that the project cannot meet its debt service.

Based on the origination team's analysis, the likelihood of an equity call 
related to the comfort letter appears to be minimal given:  
the project  is projected to achieve an average 1.92x debt service coverage 
ratio in the pro forma model
the partnership maintains business interruption insurance
the project can subordinate $2MM in O&M incentive payments annually to meet 
its debt service targets

2)  Panther Creek -- Equity Support Agreements:  ADC, as well the other major 
partner, Constellation, have provided guarantees in favor of the Panther 
Creek project lenders, each with a maximum exposure of $5.75 MM  Equity 
support under this agreement may be called on if the Panther Creek project 
does not meet its debt service requirements.  We believe that these 
obligations should be maintained by ADC and not up-streamed to Enron as Enron 
obligations, however, the consenting parties may disagree.

In the event that Enron is required to provide this support in exchange for 
consent, the origination team believes it is unlikely that the project 
lenders will call on the equity support agreements due to the coverage ratio, 
insurance and payment subordination items discussed above under item 1) above.

3)  Gilberton -- Capital Support Agreement:  Orion Power Company (a 
subsidiary of ADC) has committed to providing a maximum of $1.25 MM in equity 
support to the Gilberton Power Project, in the event that debt service cannot 
be met.  We have not provided for this in the DASH as we believe that these 
obligation should be maintained by Orion and not upstreamed to either ADC or 
Enron as either an ADC or Enron obligation.

The origination team believes that if Enron is called upon to provide this 
credit support, the impact of such would be minimal because:
the agreement expires once project debt is repaid in Dec 2002
the project maintains a cash debt service reserve of $16 MM (and only $32 MM 
of debt reamains outstanding)
pro forma debt service coverage ratios average 1.53x against a target of 1.15x

Given there is minimal expectation the facilities will be drawn upon, RAC 
does not foresee a material impact on the overall project economics.  To the 
extent guarantees or letters of credit are issued, an appropriate cost for 
these guarantees should be deducted from the value of the transaction.

Please let me know if you have any questions with regard to this change.

Regards,

Subject: Change to the Inga DASH

The Approval Amount for the Inga DASH has been revised from $98 million to 
$105.25 million to accomodate the potential requirement of having to replace 
existing credit support facilities provided by the seller, A. Ahlstrom, or 
the target, Ahlstrom Development Corporation ("ADC").  Although not explicit, 
this requirment may arise as A.Ahlstrom/ADC attempt to obtain 
"change-in-ownership" consents from partners, lenders and lessors to complete 
Enron's acquisition of ADC.  As we believe that the liklihood of this 
requirement occuring is greatest with regard to 1) and 2) below, the DASH

Subject:	Salary

Dear Mr. Lay ---

As a recently terminated employee of Enron, I have watched the stock's
dramatic tumble in the last weeks mount on top of the horrible performance
over the last months.  As Chairman and CEO, you are ultimately responsible
for everything that goes on in the company.  Without getting into the
potentially criminal and certainly ill-conceived activities of you and other
Enron executives, past and present, I think you have done little but pay lip
service in order to correct things.

Mr. Lay, you and the other executives receive very large salaries.  None of
you is hurting for money.  I think it unconscionable that you and other
executives continue to draw a paycheck.  While employees and others like me
have seen our net worth go from respectable sums to zero, you remain wealthy
beyond most of our dreams.  What's worse, you take more from the company
every week in the form of pay.  I realize you haven't had a soul in quite
sometime.  But are you so unconcerned with the well-being of the people like
me who believed in you and worked years and years for you, that you feel
justified adding insult to injury?  You have literally ruined the lives of
thousands of people.  Your employees deserve better than this!  I was
terminated at mid-year because my book was losing $2 million.  That's right,
$2 million!  That's after I'd made tens of millions for you over the past
eight years.  You and yours have lost me more than that of my own personal
money now.  I don't quite know how to fire you.

It's obvious that neither you nor any other executive currently in power at
Enron have any credibility whatsoever.  Cutting off difficult questions on a
conference call or ignoring pointed questions from employees don't go along
way in restoring any credibility or respect.  There is none left, and yet
you continue to take money out of the Enron coffers for yourself in the form
of compensation.  The hubris there is so incredible to me that it defies
comprehension.

Why, exactly, is Enron paying you?  Do you feel justified being paid by
Enron?  Do you feel justified seeing Enron pay large sums of money to others
involved while those of us with our retirement and childrens' education
funds tied up in Enron suffer more?

I worked at Enron from May of 1993 until this month.  I watched my net worth
increase substantially with my hard work at Enron.  Now, in the blink of an
eye, my net worth has plummeted to levels I haven't experienced since long
before I went to work at Enron.  I worked there for nearly nine years and
now have nothing to show for it.  Well, that's not entirely true.  I have
learned a valuable lesson.  I will never put my faith in someone again like
I did in you.  I now know that you couldn't care less about the well-being
of your employees.  You do still, however, show an incredible capacity for
greed.  You continue to rob the company of funds that could be going to more
useful places.

As I said, I was terminated because my book had $2 million in losses YTD
based on a couple of bad trades and some bad positions I inherited.  In this
pay-for-performance world, where does that leave you?  You continue to
enrich yourself while losing billions of dollars every single day.  I
imagine the PRC would have looked poorly on me if I lost 10-30% of the
company's value each day the market was open.

I no longer work for Enron, but I am left holding the bag with a ton of
worthless options and shares in my 401(k).  I only have a short time in
which to exercise those options.  I don't have the luxury of waiting for
enough good news to come out of the company to make them valuable.  I'm just
one of the thousands upon thousands of financial lives you've ruined.  The
very people that have made you rich you have made poor.  And somehow, you
seem to smile as you keep doing it!

I'd like your response as to why you feel it necessary for you and notable
others to continue to take money from the rest of us in the form of a
paycheck.  Please write me back.

Sincerely,


Scott Hendrickson
(713)521-7674

Subject: PRC

I would like to thank all of you for putting quality time and effort into 
this important process.  There is nothing more important to ENA than 
attracting and retaining the most talanted and innovative people.

Effectively immediately, written and oral feedback for commercial managers 
and directors can be delivered. As per our discussion, the PRC process is 
primarily a feedback, performance management and staff planning tool.  It 
provides a data point for bonus purposes; however, it is not the only 
determinant.  In the interest of ensuring the most effective performance 
management tool, I would suggest that we implement the following:
 a)For employees ranked in the strong and above categories, the ultimate 
ranking should not be communicated and the message should focus on progress 
towards identified commercial goals and objectives and progress towards the 
further development of desirable leadership and commerical capabilities. 
Written and oral feedback should be delivered immediately;
 b) For employees ranked in the satisfactory, needs improvement and issues 
category, the ultimate ranking should be communicated to ensure approriate 
documentation of performance and to stimulate a plan to rectify or cure 
performance issues.  For the satisfactory category, the message should focus 
on increasing deal-flow, financial performance and productivity.  The bar is 
always being raised.  For the needs improvement category, the message should 
focus on turning around poor performance over the next six months.  For the 
issues category, the business unit manager should determine, in conjunction 
with your HR rep., the appropriate plan to find a better "fit" in the 
organization or counsel out.  Regardless, the ENA Office of the Chairman will 
require a written plan of action for all employees in the needs improvement 
and issues category from the business unit manager documenting the plan of 
action to rectify performance.

Vice President ranking can not be communicated until after the Enron VP PRC 
currently scheduled for July 31st.  I anticipate a similar process as above 
with our officer feedback process.  Associate and Analyst rankings can not be 
communicated until after the Enron A&A PRC currently scheduled for July 19th.

Other identified action items from the meetings include:
 a) the HR group will put together a "profile and performance book" for ENA's 
A&A's to ensure our representatives can augment performance information at 
the July 19th meeting;
 b) ENA will be aggressively attempting to retain highest performing A&A's to 
continue rotating within ENA;
 c) ENA will be holding an additional "off-cycle" A&A super-saturday for 
Houston and Portland in August to augment our capabilities in this area;
 and d) your HR representative is building a pipeline of outside employment 
candidates for your review each week.  Please review these resumes in a 
timely basis and let them know your interest or lack thereof.

Please communicate to your organization as appropriate.

Regards
Mark and Dave

Jeff/Mark or Sherri or whoever gets your emails: 

Thanks for the Astros tickets.  The estate planning lawyer that I am using is Don Fizer with Fizer, Beck, something, something.  He is located in the Galleria at 1360 Post Oak Blvd, Suite 1600, Houston, TX  77056 and his number is 713-332-4251.  He has been great to work with because I was clueless and he was able to explain this stuff in a way that was pretty easy for me to understand.  I also recommend making the first stop at the law firm instead of the trust company or financial advisor because I have found several of the trust companies and financial advisors really trying to push cookie cutter stuff and it is pretty easy to get something that doesn't fit your specific needs.  I found Don very good at looking at my situation and directing me to a couple specific strategies and then to a couple trust companies that are better equipped to handle that.  

The trust company I went with was Sentinel Trust, they are located at San Felipe and Kirby - 2001 Kirby Dr, suite 1210, Houston, 77019-6081.  Bob Sweeney is my contact there 713-528-3728.  I went with them for two reasons.  1 Because I was basically philosophically aligned with their approach ... conservative ...and I liked them better.  

and 2 they are very rigorous in their evaluation of investments and they have a guy named Bruce (I don't have his last name) who is interesting to talk to about markets, investments etc and I think he is smarter than the average bear.  

I will get you the name of the other trust company when I can find it. 

Good Luck 


Ken

I am trying to obtain an attendance list as well as confirm the other 
speakers on the panel.  The initial list of speakers included the Governor of 
California and the Governor of Pennsylvania, although I am not sure if they 
are coming.  If ESCA gets Davis and Ridge, I think that we would have a good 
opportunity for you.

Once I have more information I'll be in contact.

Dave --

Alstom ESCA is holding "Summit 2000" in Las Vegas Oct 16 - Oct 17.  The 
purpose of the meeting is to bring together people from throughout the 
industry to discuss key issues.  

Alstom ESCA is a French company that builds EMS systems in the US.  They 
developed the EMS for Enron's control areas.  We are working with them on 
Project e-trans (the RTO software).

The first panel in the am on Monday involves Re-regulation and Competition.  
They would like someone from Enron to present and participate.  Right now, 
they have  Pacificorp and are trying to get someone from government in PA and 
CA.  The presentation / speech is 10 - 15 minutes followed by 30 minutes of 
Q&A for the panel.

Do you have any interest in presenting?  This could be a good opportunity to 
deliver our message throughout the industry.

Please let me know.

Thanks,

Jim

Enron Energy Services has created explosive growth in the retail energy 
business.  To advance EES, leadership position and to rapidly expand the 
reach of its energy management services, the company is forming four new 
business groups and promoting several key individuals.

EES Europe is responsible for energy outsourcing across Europe, as well as 
rapidly growing mid-market business (Enron Direct, Enron Directo) and heavy

All four new business leaders will report directly to EES, Office of the

Dinner is still on for Tuesday, October 16 with Dean May and the three scholarship recipients.  One student, Holland Brown, will join us a little late, as she has class until 8:00 pm.  I sent a note to Dean May reconfirming the dinner and the time (7:00 cocktails and 7:30 dinner).  Seven other faculty/staff members are included on the invitation list, although I am awaiting a response from Dean May on any changes or additions to that list of UT attendees.  

I have booked The Josephine House again - yes, third year in a row, but it has worked well and hopefully those of us who are yearly attendees don't mind the repeat!  You, Brent and I took the the scholarship winners to Sullivan's late in the spring.  

Planned invitees from Enron are you, me, and Brent, plus the two others who interviewed candidates for the scholarships - Loftis Fitzwater (one of the first year winners) and Andrea Reed.  Roger Ondrecko was the fourth interviewer, but is obviously not included.  

Others that we could include are Billy Lemmons, as AA program head, Ben Glissan, as the MBA executive lead for UT, and Christy Patrick from University Affairs (frankly, though, I haven't been able to get University Affairs remotely interested in this event, even though Karen Marshall on their staff last year planned the dinner).  

Per your note, we could certainly include anyone else who may be helping us with interviews at UT.  Lexi says she will be busy that night making phone calls for 2nd round interviews, and she plans to have our analysts go to dinner with our summer interns who are back on campus.  Checking the list of "more senior" interviewers who could be included for dinner, it looks like Beth Apollo, Randy Petersen, Hunter Shively, and Greg Piper.  Lexi has checked with Wes about interviewing - he can't do it.  She is waiting for calls back from Mike Deville and Mark Lindsey.  

Who would you like to include from Enron at the dinner from the names in bold above?  --Sally

I have put together a brief campus update, including all previous and future events for the fall recruiting season.  Changes to our original campus plan are noted on the attachment.  As you can see, I still need 3 interviewers for October 16th.

All of our events have been well-received on campus.  The presentations that we have given to various student organizations have been of great benefit to our recruiting effort.

Regarding our campus numbers, I intend for the following:
Full Time:
Round 1: interview 55 candidates
Round 2: interview 36 candidates
Super Saturday: invite 15 candidates
Target: hire 10 candidates

Interns:
Round 1: interview 14 candidates
Round 2: interview 8 candidates
Target: hire 5-6 interns

	Please let me know if you need anything else or if I can provide any additional information.

	Thank you!

Jeff:

I talked to your dad and he has mentioned that you might be interested in 
having our class build a shed for you.  We pretty much make whatever you 
would like to the specifications that you prefer. All of our buildings are 
durable and solidly constructed.  We build them in our shop and the ownner 
is rersponsible for their delivery.  There is no labor cost so you are only 
charged for the materials.

Our most popular size and style is the 8' x 12' barn . This is the most 
economical building that we construct and it is an easier one to haul to a 
given site. This building has an exterior of T-111 siding which is cedar 
style grooved exterior plywood which can be stained and sealed. We have 
usually build them with a 3'-10 1/2" wide door opening.  I would think that 
would be wide enough for a four wheeler, but you would have to have your 
dad measure your vehicle to make sure.. We have probably built and sold 
over 30 of these in the past ten years. The price on this shed usually 
varies between $800 and $900.



Your dad also indicated an interest in a 10 x 12 gable style shed which is 
a bit bigger and ofcourse more expensive.  It has vinyl siding and aluminum 
soffit/overhang, I am attaching a picture of one we made for Joe 
Pronschinske.  This project is a bit harder to transport as it is oversize 
and legally you are  to obtain an oversize laod permit to haul it.   Your 
dad indicated that Joe would possibly haul it though.
The picture I am attaching shows a common 3' entry door.  We are presently 
building a structure for Nolan Goplin that has a overhead 6' wide roll up 
door.  The price on a 10' x 12' shed with a 6' wide roll-up door would be 
roughly $1500.


We will build either style and can modify the plans to meet your 
needs.  With the time we have left in the semester the 8 x 12 would be the 
easiest for us to build, but if you let me know right away, by Monday 
October 22, that you would like a 10 x12 size we would still be able to 
finish that one on time.

If you have any questions just e-mail me or call:
	Whitehall School Disctrict 715-538-4364
	My Home number 715-985-3063.

Have a good one and take with you later.

Sincerely,

Mel Nelson

What do you think of a hostile bid for SOCO's transmission assets (Georgia 
Power, Gulf Power, Alabama Power, Savannah Electric, & Mississippi Power & 
Light), and a simultaneously create an ISO/RTO that is auctioned to the 
market.  This would clearly expedite the opening of markets in the SE 
significantly.

I think we could get an FPL, Duke, VEPCO, Entergy, Cinergy type company to 
provide a pre-negotiated purchase price for the transmission facilities so 
our capital at risk would be minimal.  Additionally, we would cut a deal with 
FERC on what the new market design would look like and the ultimate 
transmission owner would live with the market design.

What are your thoughts.

Mark, I am not completely sure what the other groups want to do; however, 
assuming a fixed amount of the "internal" legal costs are fairly represented 
by this allocation as ENA's "capacity" charge, you are correct.  This number 
will be in the P/L under your name.  The "outside" legal costs should be 
tracked and controlled and carried at the business unit (by deal) level.   I 
need an estimate of the quarterly "capacity charge" for ENA and an estimate 
of outside legal costs by business unit.

I have attached the "time allocations" (which are used for inside costs only) 
by attorney to the various business groups.  We can derive the percentage of 
total legal department inside costs from this chart, in order to calculate 
the capacity charge, for ENA and the other wholesale groups and ENW.  We had 
used this chart to bill back to the various business units within ENA, but we 
will stop doing that now per our conversation.  Are you in agreement?

Chris, sounds good - a) Wes will work with you on earnings recognition issues 
for Pastoria and b) selling the LM's and the LV Cogen asset is a good call 
regardless of the hit.  Some accounting flexibility on the LV hit may be 
worthwhile.  Value protected counts just as much as new value created - you

Subject: Update on Pastoria and Las Vegas Sale

Dave,

We made good progress last week on the sale of Pastoria and Las Vegas.    
Kelemen is doing a great job.

In general, Calpine is more agressive and can move quicker than AES - AES has 
one small team on both deals and is slower at turning docs.  Without giving 
up any rights or discouraging AES from pursuing Pastoria, we are trying to 
position AES on LV and keep Calpine's value for Pastoria close to their 
original bid.

Calpine - Pastoria
Early in the week, Calpine clawed back about $12 million from their bid 
primarily by claiming that the turbine contract is overpriced by $10 million, 
and their bid assumed  "market" for the turbines.   While they are correct 
(the extra $10 million for Catalytica), we have gotten most of that back.  
There bid now is $37MM (vs. $41) plus up to $5MM if the contingency is not 
used between signing and closing.  Calpine also wanted to include other 
permits (other than CEC) as conditions precedent and they wanted us to rep 
that the scheduled permits are the only ones required to construct and 
operate.  This is far too onerous and we are pushing back on this.  Our plan 
is to get a PSA that only has HSR and CEC permit as conditions precedent.  
The other negotiating item is with respect to mechanics of continuing the 
development between signing and closing, and who pays for it and who is at 
risk.  This is relevant if you think of the scenario where incremental costs 
are necessary in order to get the Non-appealable CEC Permit.  

AES - Pastoria
Same PSA issues as above, but AES seems more skiddish about the development 
risks (other than CEC).  They want to change some of the EPC contract terms, 
they want a more-involved transition team and  they want us to take more risk 
on post-signing/pre-closing development.  Their bid was $27million plus 
upside for the 250MW expansion and a services agreement for fuel supply and 
schedule coordination services.  We have given them term sheets that provide 
for an extra $10 million for the 250MW expansion and approximately $750,000 
per year of risk-free service revenues.  They have not yet responded.  By 
contrast, Calpine does not want to use NEPCO, and they dont want our services 
or any material ongoing involvement (cleaner).  

CEC Process:
On Thursday night we received the Presiding Members Proposed Decision (PMPD), 
recommending approval of the Project.  By statute, this is one month early 
and the quickest in California to date.  This is a 400 page document and we 
are combing through it to determine any material changes from our original 
filing and the original staff assessment - none detected yet.  The stated 
process is that we would receive our CEC permit on December 20, after which 
their is a 30 day appeal period.  If there is no appeal, the process is done 
Jan 19.  For purposes of handicapping the risk, we have already gone through 
the public hearing process.  While there was some intervention, our remote 
site is not in the environmental/NIMBY crosshairs like other projects.  In 
order for the appeal process to derail the timing, someone needs to show that 
(i) a law was broken or (ii) the CEC analysis is seriously flawed.  In the 
past two years five plants were approved and only one was appealed - this was 
due to a resident that was not notified and therefore the project broke the 
law.   This caused a 4 month delay.   The two bidders will not take the risk 
on the CEC permit getting appealed.  In Calpine's words, it would look pretty 
bad on Wall Street if they had to write off a $40MM development fee paid to 
Enron for nothing! 

AES-Las Vegas
They seem genuinely interested in the asset - more the expansion than the 
QF.  They like LM6000's and think they are great resource for the location.  
We told them they are behind the other bidders both on time and value.  They 
have reviewed the EPC contract and understand the quality of the LD's, 
liability limits and the consortium EPC group.  They indicated that they have 
no problem with getting incremental insurance in order to protect the value 
of hitting June, 2002.  They want to meet with the EPC group and provide 
input to the notice to proceed.  Closing for them on this deal is a little 
cleaner than Pastoria because we have the permits in hand, and it is not as 
big a bet (smaller asset, existing operation, less political risk, etc.).   
Our plan is to turn the PSA one more time (Monday) and then tell them that if 
they get their bid up a few million ($26MM to say $30MM), we will focus on 
them for a week or so to try to get it closed.  

Deal Timing - Pastoria: Firm up Calpine on value and risk allocation during 
the next week and aim for signing and HSR filing on December 1.  Sometime 
before December 1 we need to finalize our plans with respect to earnings 
recognition.  We have been talking with Deffner, Westfall and lawyers about 
different structures involving either (i) LJM; (ii) AIG; or (iii) selling to 
Calpine with liquidated damages relating to CEC Permit.  As you can imagine, 
there are pros and cons to each approach.  We expect to know more on this by 
Wednesday of this week and will update you at that time.

Deal Timing - Las Vegas: The only condition precedent should be the HSR.  If 
they can move quicker, we will target December 1 to sign and late Dec to 
close.   The urgency relates to schedule - the longer we wait, the greater 
the risk of missing June 2002 COD.  With respect to QIV earnings, AES' bid 
results in a $6MM hit.  Signing the deal to sell reduces fair market 
valuation.  Two possibilities we are exploring: If AES increases its bid, the 
hit may be neglibible; alternatively we may be able to discount the LM6000's 
being sold to them, which may not show up as a hit since the LM6000 pool is 
accrual and being sold into Turbopark.  Like the Pastoria analysis, we will 
know more this week and will update you when we know.   


Regards,

Chris

Barry, I have not spoken to Whitt yet - working on this week.

I would suggest that you will need to get a few bright managers/associates to 
manage the mid-market and a couple of more experienced originators (internal

done.  I would call Oxley for help if needed.

Joe, thanks for the message. It has been my experience that people who have 
had experience in our trading, mid market and structuring groups have a 
better overall understanding of how Enron (ECT or ENA) looks at value and 
manages risk.  Personally, this is the track I took which included a very 
solid foundation in accounting, operations, trading, structuring and then 
ultimately in origination.

I hope this helps.

You mentioned in enside that some of the skills needed to succeed at Enron 
are solid structuring skills as well as a grasp of the the accounting, legal, 
commercial and credit implications of a deal.  What is the best way to obtain 
these skills?  Do you believe it is necessary or worthwhile to work a trading 
desk to truly understand how ENA functions?

Thanks,

I would like to thank all of you for putting quality time and effort into 
this important process.  There is nothing more important to ENA than 
attracting and retaining the most talanted and innovative people.

Effectively immediately, written and oral feedback for commercial managers 
and directors can be delivered. As per our discussion, the PRC process is 
primarily a feedback, performance management and staff planning tool.  It 
provides a data point for bonus purposes; however, it is not the only 
determinant.  In the interest of ensuring the most effective performance 
management tool, I would suggest that we implement the following:
 a)For employees ranked in the strong and above categories, the ultimate 
ranking should not be communicated and the message should focus on progress 
towards identified commercial goals and objectives and progress towards the 
further development of desirable leadership and commerical capabilities. 
Written and oral feedback should be delivered immediately;
 b) For employees ranked in the satisfactory, needs improvement and issues 
category, the ultimate ranking should be communicated to ensure approriate 
documentation of performance and to stimulate a plan to rectify or cure 
performance issues.  For the satisfactory category, the message should focus 
on increasing deal-flow, financial performance and productivity.  The bar is 
always being raised.  For the needs improvement category, the message should 
focus on turning around poor performance over the next six months.  For the 
issues category, the business unit manager should determine, in conjunction 
with your HR rep., the appropriate plan to find a better "fit" in the 
organization or counsel out.  Regardless, the ENA Office of the Chairman will 
require a written plan of action for all employees in the needs improvement 
and issues category from the business unit manager documenting the plan of 
action to rectify performance.

Vice President ranking can not be communicated until after the Enron VP PRC 
currently scheduled for July 31st.  I anticipate a similar process as above 
with our officer feedback process.  Associate and Analyst rankings can not be 
communicated until after the Enron A&A PRC currently scheduled for July 19th.

Other identified action items from the meetings include:
 a) the HR group will put together a "profile and performance book" for ENA's 
A&A's to ensure our representatives can augment performance information at 
the July 19th meeting;
 b) ENA will be aggressively attempting to retain highest performing A&A's to 
continue rotating within ENA;
 c) ENA will be holding an additional "off-cycle" A&A super-saturday for 
Houston and Portland in August to augment our capabilities in this area;
 and d) your HR representative is building a pipeline of outside employment 
candidates for your review each week.  Please review these resumes in a 
timely basis and let them know your interest or lack thereof.

Please communicate to your organization as appropriate.

Regards
Mark and Dave

Jeff:

Thank you for agreeing to spend a few minutes on Tuesday, April 17 with Moody's Investor Service.  You are scheduled to speak at noon in room EB50M.  To put the day into context, Moody's will have heard prior to your session presentations from Andy and Ben on 2000 results, Mike McConnell on Global Markets, and Jeff McMahon on Wholesale Services.  Our afternoon session will include presentations from Dan Leff on EES, Rod Hayslett on ETS, Kevin Hannon on EBS and Rick Buy on RAC.

In attendance from Moody's will be (in order of rank) Mike Foley - Group Managing Director, John Diaz - Managing Director, and Stephen Moore - Relationship Manager (our analyst).  Diaz and Moore are very familiar with the Enron credit profile.  Foley is their boss.  He apparently is the leader of their ratings committee.  He has not historically attended our meetings.

Key messages for you to hit (which will have already been touched upon by Andy and reinforced throughout the day) include:

Enron's core businesses - have never been better.  We are the market leader in gas and power by a wide margin;
Portland General - we will ultimately divest of this entity and are disappointed that the Sierra Pacific transaction was derailed by regulatory hurdles.  However, PG provides considerable, stable cash flows;
International Asset Sales - we are still committed to liquidating our interests in low returning investments.  Market problems have delayed our M&A effort but we expect movement in the next 12-24 months;
Credit Profile is critical to core businesses - we protect our credit rating as a matter of corporate policy.  Our asset sale and corresponding capital redeployment strategy is based in part to allow us to either reduce leverage or to invest in areas with stronger cash flows thereby improving our key coverage ratio;  and 
Issue Resolution Ongoing - we have some issues (such as California, Dabhol, and Azurix) which are important and are receiving the attention of top management.  They will be covered by Ben and Rick Buy's group.  The main message is that they are not representative of our core business.

If you have any questions, please call me at x31770 or (713) 962-4013 (cell phone).

Thanks,
Tim

However, if we can not reach a term O&M agreement please maintain the

A couple of points:

1) Dobler says that he has been in Nigeria for six months with no 
compensation and very poor communication.
2) The scope has changed from 3 barges to 9 barge.
3) His price quote is cost reimbursement plus $750,000/year for approximately 
thirteen years.  PV is between $5 and $6 million.
4) APACHI is having a severe case of sticker shock.
5) He insists this is market for a major international provider.

I need to understand your view as to whether we should price at market or 
does OEC have the mandate to be a "support" function for other Enron 
businesses (I assume the answer is NO)

It is apparent that we are not going to reach agreement on an O&M contract 
that will be acceptable to third parties.  Given our clear intention to exit 
this project as fast as possible and extract our value through a promote, 
this leaves me no choice but to seek other alternatives.  I would appreciate 
your providing me interim O&M services until I can identify a third party 
service provider.  If you carry out your threat to abandon the assets, this 
will result in invalidation of our insurance coverage.  I hope you understand 
that this is not in anyone's interest.  I am disappointed to discover that 
our first experience with the new structure of O&M services is so 
unsatisfactory.

Joe, EnronOnline is essentially the internet distribution channel for our gas

origination organizations in order to keep us spending more time in the 
market than focused on internal issues.  As far as specifics, you will have 
to wait and see.

I enjoyed your presentation this morning.  You mentioned that one of your 
current tasks is "pushing the legacy origination/structuring model to the 
next step".  What do you mean by this?  Do you envision using the internet or 
other technology to enhance the current origination structure?

Jeff, can you speak briefly with Kevin on this one - intriguing idea if the 
execution was probable.

By the way, what is our plan with Sithe?

Put a bid into SOCO's shareholders for the transmission assets only.  Since 
the market is valuing Genco assets at a much higher multiple, a bid at book 
value for the transco would be very intriguing to the existing shareholder 
base.

Given a high probability of supply shortage in Florida over the next 2-4 
years, the transmission gateway to Florida is extremely valuable, 
particularly if expansions are done off the existing system.

In addition, it would give Enron tremendous regulatory leverage with the 
pending Entergy/FPL (SOCO connects systems), and the entire SE market, 
including TVA.

I know it's a longshot, but we will have to do something radical to bust open 
the SE market into a free functioning commodity market.  The SE is 
essentially untapped from a power trading standpoint right now, and the 
market is nearly 200,000 MW if you include Florida.

Dave,  I met with my team today and based on the data and information 
supplied by Steve, it is doubtful that the assets and on-going organization 
would command a current market value equivalent to book.  I am still willing 
to move the assets onto our balance sheet at book for the benefit of Enron, 
although if this was a third party bid, I would be surprised if we could pay 
this price.  Furthermore, due to your desire to maintain this discussion 
among the Houston teams only, I am assuming the PDP reserves are solid, no 
major enviornmental issues exit, legal problems are minimal and contracts are 
standard.  Let me know what you want to do. I think we have all spent enough 
time on this effort. 

On a side issue, are you aware that this is a JEDI I property?  My 
understanding is that Jedi I owns 100% of C-GAS and the Jedi I fund WILL be 
liquidated before the end of the year.  At what price will your unit pay to 
liquidate the fund?

Steve, please call Jeff and go through in detail how we got to our valuation

value that ENA would accreate over the short to medium term assuming your 
continued management.

Let me know where you end up.

Subject: Re: Commodity / Embedded Finance Deals  

Dave,

As of today, the Transaction Approval Process requires that any embedded 
financing over $500,000 needs to be DASHed.  RAC, however, is close to 
finishing a new process for commodity embedded financings--both prepaids and 
tilted swaps--that would not require a full DASH but an abbreviated approval 
document based upon specified credit ratings, financing amounts, and 
maturities for transactions having standard credit documentation.  For 
example, a $25 million, five-year exposure to a AAA counterparty with 
standard documentation is contemplated to be approved via this abbreviated 
approval document.  This abbreviated approval document would only be 
available for transactions meeting these criteria if:  (i) structured 
financing capacity were available, (ii) the funds flow issue created is 
manageable (both (i) and (ii) as confirmed by EGF), and (iii) the pricing met 
a threshold that included the structured financing cost, an appropriate 
credit spread/reserve, and a syndication risk premium.

The abbreviated approval document is intended to expedite the approval of 
relatively straightforward embedded financings where a full DASH is 
impractical or inefficient.  It is presently contemplated that the 
abbreviated approval document could be approved with two signatures:  the 
Originator's and  a RAC signature (either Bill Bradford's or mine), with 
business unit management and EGF receiving weekly updates on transactions 
approved via this document, but I would welcome your thoughts on this.  In 
any event, I will provide you with the proposed abbreviated process by you 
for your review and concurrence before if it is implemented since the 
preponderance of these transactions are expected to be originated by ENA.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.

Regards,

Dave

Tim, I would argue that we should pursue this business as long as a) we are 
being adequately compensated for the financing and underlying commodity risk; 
b) we have very good paper; c) we are dealing with solid credits and are 
charging an appropriate risk adjusted cost of capital for the underlying 
financing; d) we have the ability to syndicate the capital or funds flow 
position if needed to manage cash issues and e) that RAC is comfortable that 
we are reaching these goals.

Any imbedded financing or $5M or more should be DASHED.  David, Joe and Mark 
should be your key contacts to ensure we are adequately managing these issues 
but I do not see any fatal flaw in the strategy if priced/managed well and we 
watch the funds flow issues.

I want to take this opportunity before the transfer of Houston Pipeline Company assets and employees to American Electric Power to thank each of you for your teamwork and success in our years together.

Some of you were here when I joined your company in 1984, but many of you arrived during the Enron era and might not know the full story of my arrival.  I was president of Transco Energy at the time and was probably in line to be the chairman.  I did not expect to ever join another energy company.  Yet the directors of Houston Natural Gas felt like a new management team was needed for their company to prosper in a rapidly changing industry environment.  The quality of people I saw at HNG convinced me that the company would be a good platform from which to make major changes.  And the results over the last 17 years could not have been better.

Houston Pipeline Company has been a major contributor to developing Enron into what it is today.  Your professionalism, ideas, dedication and commitment toward this company have been instrumental in making our success possible.  For this, you will not only be a critical part of Enron's history, but you will also always deserve Enron's gratitude.

I wish you nothing but the very best in your next endeavors, even as I am sure you will not need my good luck wishes.  As always, your professionalism and dedication will be your best allies when facing new challenges and opportunities.

Sincerely,

Mark, The word on the street is that the NewPower folks are getting further in trouble (ie) strange trading activity, etc. Looks and smells a little like the old EES.

Couple of opps:
	- get another shareholder on-side and demand an Enron led audit to confirm financial and operating health;
	- followed up by hostile exit of mgt team if significant issues arise.

Issues:
	- obviously pushes us into another level of complicity/fiduciary in a blow up or bankruptcy not unlike the issues we faced with Kafus et al; however, given our continued interest a significant control issue could result in a significant acceleration of a write-off of our existing position plus any outstanding credit.

I would recommend we force the management team to submit to a detailed audit as a part of a united shareholder iniative - Lets discuss.

Rick Buy, what is our current credit position?

Greg/John, do you have a view on this one?

Rick Causey, we  probably need a more "permanent solution" ot the NewPower issue.

Subject: 4Q Earnings from ENA Principal Investments

We have now refined our initial estimates for potential 4Q fair value 
earnings on each of our portfolio investments:

Dais-Analytic ($8.27 MM) - DAC has signed an agreement with Lucky Goldstar of 
Korea which includes a $5 MM minority equity investment at a pre-money 
valuation equal to $147.9 MM.  The agreement has been signed, is legally 
binding, can not be unilaterally terminated by LG and transfer of money will 
happen as soon as LG receives Korean central bank approval.  (Note:  We could 
take an additional $3.55 MM gain, or $11.8 MM aggregate, if we chose to 
exercise our option to invest $4.5 MM in DAC prior to year end)

Encorp ($14.1 MM) - Encorp has received a term sheet from Ballentine Capital 
which values the company at $100 MM pre-money.  Beacon Capital and Goldman 
Sachs have both passed on making an investment at $100 MM.  Given current 
market conditions, we believe a pre-money valuation of $90 MM is more 
realistic and closer to what Ballentine will ultimately do the deal at.  The 
$14.1 MM figure corresponds to a valuation of $90 MM.   

Solo Energy ($1.5 MM) - the downturn in the equity markets has had its effect 
on Solo's fund raising.  Chase H&Q has solicited a number of investors in the 
market, including Beacon, Perseus, Stephens (Little Rock) and Ballentine and 
all are interested and reviewing.  Charlie's sense is that the term sheets 
that we should receive by year end will be at a valuation lower than the $80 
MM that H&Q has been advertising to the company (and us).  The $1.5 MM figure 
corresponds to a pre-money valuation of $60 MM, which we view as more 
realistic.

Metering Technology Corp. ($1.0 MM) - Aqua International Partners has agreed 
to invest $15 MM at a pre-money valuation of $45 MM.  

Power Systems Mfg LLC ($0.72 MM) - the principals of PSM have agreed to sell 
the company to Calpine for $43 MM, making our warrant worth $1.72 MM.  Enron 
will receive cash for the warrant upon closing of the deal.  PSM's proceeds 
will be paid out over a 2-3 year period.

Utiliquest - we learned in November that Utiliquest had lost its bid to 
retain the Atlanta area locating business of BellSouth, Atlanta Gas & Light, 
Metromedia (Cable TV) and Georgia Power.  This was obviously disappointing to 
us - and symptomatic of the performance which led me to replace Utiliquest's 
CEO just prior to the award of Atlanta bid (which went to STS, a subsidiary 
of Dycom).  The initial indication from the company was that - while Atlanta 
represented $20 MM in revenues (roughly 20% of total revenues) - there would 
be a proportionately smaller change in EBITDA and the bottom line.  After 
further analysis - conducted in connection with our planned divestiture - we 
have determined that there will likely be a $2-3 MM reduction in EBITDA for 
2000.  Our anticipated EBITDA exit multiple is 6-7x 2000 figures.  I need to 
discuss a revaluation of Utiliquest in more detail with Kevin, Wes Colwell 
and Andrea Reed.

Total comes to $25.6 MM plus whatever we determine is achievable on 
Utiliquest. 

Please call if you have any questions.

Body:
The following summarizes recent price cap events in California.  I think that 
I have most of it right.  If there is anything wrong or missing please let me 
know.  Please don't share the attached spreadsheet with anyone outside of 
Enron.

Regards,
Tim

New Cap Specifics
On 10/26/2000 the ISO Board passed a motion by a vote of 13-10 to implement a 
new price cap methodology.
The new methodology will become effective 11/3/2000 or as soon thereafter as 
can be implemented.  CAISO staff has indicated that it will be difficult to 
achieve that start date.  They have not yet indicated what an achievable date 
might be.
The new price cap methodology will remain in place until:
Comprehensive market changes have been implemented and the market has proven 
to be workably competitive under a variety of load conditions.
Either FERC or the ISO board orders its removal.
Cap prices will be based on the average NYMEX L3D settlement average and the 
following heat rate table:
  Load Level  Heat Rate  4.00 Gas Example Cap
  <25 GW   10,775   $43.10
  25 GW to 30 GW 14,175   $56.70
  30GW to 35 GW  17,225   $68.90
  35GW to 40 GW  27,225   $108.90
  >40 GW   $250/MWh  $250/MWh
Caps will be rounded up to the nearest $5/MWh increment.
Demand bids and demand responsiveness programs are exempt from these caps.
The ISO will post the price caps for each load level at least 48 hours prior 
to the beginning of each calendar month.  Based on the ISO's two day-ahead 
system load forecast, the ISO will post hourly caps at least 24 hours prior 
to the hour of delivery.

FERC Context
FERC has delegated cap authority to the CAISO until 11/15/2000.
The ISO has asserted that they don't need FERC authority since it is a bid 
cap rather than a sales cap.  FERC regulates sales, not purchases, of 
electricity and therefore can regulate sales prices but not purchase prices.
The ISO has filed with FERC for an extension of the price cap authority.  
FERC has to rule on the filing by 11/18/2000.  (Note that this is 3 days 
after their authority expires)
FERC will release its proposed order on 11/1/2000 based on the results of its 
206 investigation of the California wholesale power markets.  We don't know 
what they will find or what they will propose.
The proposed order will have a 30 day comment period, after which FERC will 
likely issue a final order.  FERC will be accepting oral comments on 
11/9/2000 in Washington.  Enron still has to determine who will provide oral 
comments.
Many companies have filed at FERC advocating or opposing a litany of price 
caps, cost based rates, and market redesign recommendations.
It is likely that the price caps approved by the ISO board will go into 
effect.  How long they will remain in effect will depend on whether FERC 
extends the ISO price cap authority and whether the final order stemming from 
the current 206 investigation stipulates a specific price cap policy.

Impact of Price Caps
The attached spreadsheet contains a table of likely maximum monthly prices at 
different gas price levels.  We think that this is the highest that markets 
would clear since it assumes that each hour clears at the cap.  It is hard to 
say whether actual prices would clear significantly lower than the cap 
because we don't know whether sellers will offer below the cap or at the 
cap.  The assumptions behind our analysis are detailed in the bullets below.
Take actual historical loads from 1999 and 2000.   
Calculate implied price cap for each hour using actual historical load, new 
price cap methodology, and a range of gas prices.
Divide historical hours into peak and off-peak buckets.
Calculate average price for each month for peak hours and off-peak hours.  
For example, we have two years worth of data for the months of January 
through September.  Each month has approximately 400 hours.  for January 
through September, we took approximately 800 observations for each month (400 
from each year) and calculated a simple average of all of the individual 
observations.
We created a peak table and an off-peak table.  The table shows the 
calculated implied cap based off of the acutal loads at varying gas prices 
for each month.  This value represents what the month would clear at if each 
hour cleared at the cap (based on historic loads).  While any given hour 
could be above this value, our calculation estimates the likely monthly 
average cap value!
The blue shading indicates what the caps would be given current (10/27/2000 
NYMEX) forward prices.  The yellow shading indicates those forward power 
prices which are in excess of the proposed cap.

In the effort to understand this better is it fair to say that wholesale block prices between Friday afternoon and today have fallen on the offer side by $7.00 MWHr?

For example, these were the prices on Friday:

	Jack in the Box	PG&E	Offer	$41.15;	A/S	$4.93;	Block to Shape	$1.25 = Total $47.33.
	
The total price to Jack was $60.31 and includes the following additional charges $3.03 losses, $3.40 interzonal congestion; $1.75 uplifts; $1.80 ISO charges; $0.50 settlements and $2.50 "contract/legal".

I don't believe ancillaries and shape have changed dramatically; therefore, it would suggest that wholesale markets have changed by the number indicated above.

Our information would suggest that SP 15 and NP 15 on-peak has not changed by this amount between Friday to today.

This leads to two results:
	a) the generator price is closer to our original offer and
	b) our original offer on Friday was out of market and EES paid too much for supply.

Each dollar on the California deals is approximately $2.0M in value recognized in the wholesale versus retail organizations.

Please clarify.

Below are our bid/offers for the product described in the confirmation drafted by Steve Hall.  A different confirm could change these prices.  It is my understanding that the deal team has not yet agreed to the Steve Hall version of the confirm.  

Please note that these prices are for a stipulated hourly shape and include CAISO energy and associated ancillary services including regulation up, regulation down, spin, non-spin, and replacement reserves.  This pricing also assumes a good credit, wholesale counterparty with no regulatory contingencies or recission rights.  It also assumes that liquidated damages/early termination payments are cleaner than those associated with retail load contracts as all of these products exist in the wholesale market independent of whether direct access exists or not. 

Here they are:

Term			10/1/2001 to 12/31/2004
Region			Mixed SP15
PVMWh		608,607

Joe - this is the list I asked Laine to put together. - I asked him not to 
list all the folks under Laine - as I assume they stay with the project no 
matter where it goes.


Jose Anson - he is the coordinator of permitting at IBAMA and ANP for the 
pipeline.  He is also involved with working on the FUNAI issues a result of 
his efforts on the IBAMA license.  Key person.

Joao Carlos A. - although he is working on the project on an ad hoc basis he 
is key in terms of the FURNAS/Eletrobras relationship.  Not only does he know 
folks but he also gets things done within the system.

Valeria Lema - She is the relationship manager with ANP.

Daiane Duarte - Daiane Duarte is on the PanEng payroll until the end of the 
year after which she has been dialed out.  Have asked Rick several times 
about her future with his group.  She is critical locally in Cuiaba due to 
relations with FEMA and other agencies for obtaining the state permits that 
are still outstanding as well as working with Anson et al.

Lucio Reis - he is very active in working with ANEEL/ONS/MAE and others.  He 
has been a key to our success on the CCC account.  He is a must to making the 
project successful.  Knows the contacts and basically understands the project 
from the regulatory and CCC account point-of-view.

Two other people that are not involved in "our side" of fence on a daily 
basis but are valuable are Jose Bestard and John Novak.  Jose knows the 
history and John is the counsel with the longest tenure on the project.

Subject: Cuiaba Review

Rebecca has asked for a review of the Cuiaba project.   Her current thinking 
is that it should be under one shop - not split responsibility.   Which shop 
is not clear to me - I presume this will be decided pretty soon.

The review will take place the week of Dec 4th.   She wants a straight 
forward  decription of what is left to be done and what the issues are.  I am 
thinking the presenters are Laine, Rick, Jose.  In attendance are Rob and 
John.     Can divide the presentation up into - 

getting the construction finished/cost issues/EECC - subcontractor issues. - 
Laine 
Furnas/Electrobras issues - Rick 
YPF - gas supply - Mark to market position - opportunities - Rick
MAE/ONS issues - current thinking.  - Jose
Current economics. - Rick

Everyone should have a page prepared ahead of time with the discussion topics 
on it - she doesn't want a detailed presentation - just the facts.   Can we 
send the page per topic around by this friday.  

I will ask Rebecca for two hours the week of the 4th and let you know.

Joe - we should talk about where the project should best end up - I think 
Rebecca is flexible -   don't really know what Dave is thinking.

Pete

CDWR is proposing to all potential suppliers the following security package

CDWR to cover the PPA costs.

2) PPA covenant that the power supplier has payment priority over any debt, 
including the contemplated debt issue
  - the concept is that the supply is the operating cost and any debt would 
be subordinate

3) PPA Covenant that their is a uniform package to all suppliers; no more 
favorable terms or priority to ayone, no L/C, etc.


Subject to definitive language, CDWR is trying to get people to buy into this 
general plan.  What do people think?  Please try to shoot holes in this.  
Please forward to the appropriate legal, regulatory and credit folks to air 
this out.

Jeff, I would like to get your view on the economics - basically they are

At Dave Duran's request I have attached for your information two files 
containing a term sheet from El Paso reflecting the final terms as negotiated 
and a spreadsheet analysis of the valuation of that offer ($206.6mm).  The 
offer analysis uses a discount rate on the El Paso Deferred and Scheduled 
Payments of 8.25%.  This rate is the middle of the range of a recent quote 
from Treasury/RAC as to the expected rate at which we will be able to 
monetize this payment stream.  The Contingent Payments are in the form of a 
residual preferred partnership interest that we will retain and are 
discounted at the current project rate with a probability adjustment.  The 
residual partnership interest should allow us to fair value these contingent 
payments (as we are currently doing on the existing contingent payments) and 
should also be beneficial to the tax structure of the transaction.

Jeff/Mark or Sherri or whoever gets your emails:

Thanks for the Astros tickets.  The estate planning lawyer that I am using is Don Fizer with Fizer, Beck, something, something.  He is located in the Galleria at 1360 Post Oak Blvd, Suite 1600, Houston, TX  77056 and his number is 713-332-4251.  He has been great to work with because I was clueless and he was able to explain this stuff in a way that was pretty easy for me to understand.  I also recommend making the first stop at the law firm instead of the trust company or financial advisor because I have found several of the trust companies and financial advisors really trying to push cookie cutter stuff and it is pretty easy to get something that doesn't fit your specific needs.  I found Don very good at looking at my situation and directing me to a couple specific strategies and then to a couple trust companies that are better equipped to handle that.  

The trust company I went with was Sentinel Trust, they are located at San Felipe and Kirby - 2001 Kirby Dr, suite 1210, Houston, 77019-6081.  Bob Sweeney is my contact there 713-528-3728.  I went with them for two reasons.  1 Because I was basically philosophically aligned with their approach ... conservative ...and I liked them better.  
and 2 they are very rigorous in their evaluation of investments and they have a guy named Bruce (I don't have his last name) who is interesting to talk to about markets, investments etc and I think he is smarter than the average bear.  

I will get you the name of the other trust company when I can find it.

Good Luck

With the departure of Greg Wolfe and Holli Krebs, it is necessary to reestablish responsibilities to assure our continued success.  To this end:

Chris Foster will assume responsibility for the Services Desk in addition to retaining overall responsibility for the Middle Market Coverage Group.  Although he will continue to provide leadership to John, Paul and Stewart in managing the Middle Market Coverage effort, Chris will focus his day-to-day efforts on our Services business.  

John Malowney, Paul Choi and Stewart Rosman will be taking a greater leadership role within the Coverage Group.  Within this coverage group, John Malowney will assume a leadership role for Industrials throughout the WSCC, Stewart Rosman will assume responsibility for public utilities, IOUs and public/federal utilities in the Northwest and Northern California and Paul Choi will cover these same sectors in the Southwest and Southern California.  Although each of these individuals will take the lead in assuring coverage for their market segment, it will be done on a collaborative basis to take advantage of individual relationships and talents and to make sure there is back-up if someone is out of the office.  Additional personnel will be hired in the Middle Market Coverage Group within the next month.  Job postings will be made shortly.

Bill Williams will continue to manage the Real Time Group and will now report to Tim Belden.

Lisa Gang will move into the Services Group to help manage our scheduling agreement with El Paso and provide support for other services arrangements.  This will be effective September 10.  Lisa Gang, Les Rawson, and Stan Cocke will report to Chris Foster and endeavor to expand our already successful Services business.
 
While we will miss Holli and Greg personally, I have complete confidence that the new energy and fresh ideas that their departure brings will assure our market leader position will not compromised.

Dick, you need to agree with Max on the scope to be provided by the OE - I 
expect high quality service for the money we are paying.  The deal on Friday 
is completely dependent on a pre-arranged scope and a minimum quality of 
service.  I expect high quality EE&CC  people to be proactively managing cost

Attached is the updated exposure report for California.  There are four 
spreadsheets: 1) PG&E Corp and affilate exposure, 2) Edison International and 
affiliate exopsure, 3) CAISO and Cal PX exposure, and 4) Enron business unit 
combined CA exposure.  We are continuing to make progress on the mitigation 
of PG&E non-regulated exposures.  Please give me a call if you have any 
specific questions on the numbers.

Bill 
3-3831

Please note:
The numbers for the PX Credit have increased based on a more complete 
valuation.  
The P/X Credit MTM exposures are not netted against EES payables of T&D (with 
netting there would be an estimated $200mm reduction in PX Credit exposure)
All MTM numbers are valued at the Mid Curves.
Enron Wind numbers are being reviewed.
Portland General, ISO and PX exposures are estimates from last week and need 
to be updated.

I know how incredibly busy you all are, so I'm sure that making a pledge to Jeff for the MS150 has simply slipped your mind.  Well the ride is this weekend, time is running out and we need you!

Enron's goal is to raise $700,000, and Jeff's personal goal is to raise $50,000.  As of today, we are a little better than half way there.  Won't you consider helping him reach his goal?

Thanks for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing from you tomorrow...

I received the 2001 plan that Dave sent up here.  Chris and I talked and are 
working through all of the questions that Dave had.  I noticed that the gross 
margin plan for west power trading was $170 million.  When you were here I 
talked about $100 million total and then you talked me up to $120 million 
total with $100 from the trading efforts and $20 from middle 
market/services.  Why the change from $120 to $170?  Perhaps it was a 
typo?????  While I intend to make as much money as I possibly can next year, 
the $170 number seemed high.  Particularly given the regulatory freak show 
that is going down in California right now.

I'm not sure to whom I should tell this information.
 
While at an appointment on Friday afternoon, one person I met with told me hearsay, that he had heard from Dynergy employees that Dynergy had never had any intention of the merger succeeding, that the plan from the start was to get Enron's gas pipelines.
 
Given Enron's suit against Dynergy, I assume this is important to know.  If need be, I can tell you the name of the person who told me this, but I cannot vouch for what they said.

Dave, I missed one point regarding the Toronto trader. Lavorato and Belden 
have identified an associate and he's interested in coming to Toronto. He is 
in Toronto today meeting with DeVries. As a sidebar, our new office space in 
Toronto is extremely impressive (cost was Cdn $500K) and is a great selling 
feature. Hopefully this puts the trading associate "over the top".

Subject: Re: Status Report, CRP & DIVERSIFIED INDUSTRIALS  

Dave, thanks for the note. Regarding an update for Toronto, we made an offer 
to a senior industrial marketer yesterday  (Jeff Borg - 10 years experience) 
while I was in Toronto. I believe that he will accept. In addition, Paul is 
interviewing for one more deal maker (targeting John Guerro at Duke - an 
industrial gas marketer) and a manager for ENERconnect   (has interviewed a 
couple - meeting with Doug Jones from TD Bank next week). 

Scott Gilbert who is running our volume management is out recruiting for 
backoffice staff (needs 5 specialists). No success here as of yet.

Mark Haedicke, Peter Keohane and myself are working on transferring Chris 
Gaffney (Canadian Lawyer) to work in Toronto. Chris is interested and both 
Mark and myself think it would be a good fit/career move.

Dawn, Paul and myself are devising a more aggressive recruiting strategy for 
Toronto for both Paul's and Scott's groups as our presence in Toronto is 
limited. This may include full page ads in the Globe, use of head hunters 
and/or Super Saturdays. With 2 million people in Toronto, we should be having 
more success in recruiting high quality individuals.

It is my understanding that 94 new analysts are starting this August in 
Houston. I need a minimum of 5 (2 for Toronto, 3 for Calgary). I have asked 
Dawn to make this happen, but if there is any way that you can exercise your 
influence to assist in making this happen, that would be much appreciated.

Wes, we need 1999 and 2000 (including CE) ESA income statements for each 
market in as much detail as possible.   Looking for un-necessary overheads 
and where the income brightspots lie.  We would probably need the ESA 2001 
budget (income, expense, cashflow and capital) for the trading/marketing/EES 
business and the asset/regulated business in seperate formats.  A current 
balance sheet would be helpful as well.

I think it may be appropriate for both of you to join us.

Subject: Re: Itinerary

Jim,  what ever you think is appropriate.  As far as the weekend, lets just 
play it by ear.

At the meetings, I think it would be helpful to go through the following 
discussions/agenda:
 a) review the Brazilian and Argentine gas and power markets - flows, grid, 
participants (bids and offers), assets, pool structures, regulatory and 
political environment, currency and credit challenges, supply and demand & 
historical prices and volumes;
 b) review ESA's current regulated/un-regulated assets and generation 
strategy;
 c) review ESA current book positions, market views, products and product 
development;
 and d) brief review of other S. American markets.

I assume that you will have the Argentines to Brazil for the discussion and 
any one else you think appropriate.

Let me know what I need to do otherwise.

Thanks

Thanks Chris - I assume you are speaking about credit risk on the thirty day 
deal when you refer to the $2M exposure on $100 - has Tim spoken to John 
about this?  I am supportive of this proposal and approach.  Like our 
discussion, we have to find a way to be supportive to the re-development of 
this market without creating un-acceptable credit or market losses.  We also 
have to support Lay's efforts in California.

Dave,

I just spoke with Freeman to let him know that we can provide him a letter 
proposal which I can send out Monday.  In general, we will offer 50MW NP-15 
Peak from February 22 - March 31 at a fixed price (currently $265) with 
payment due every 7 days.  This would be documented under the form of EEI 
that they have agreed to and is subject to (i) payment of outstanding amounts 
due Enron; (ii) execution of EEI and confirm; (iii) confirmation that they 
will pay the amounts due; (iv) good faith obligation to put together 
creidtworthy structure; (v) good faith look at term deal which can be 
back-dated to blend with this current deal, Pastoria and Demand Management.  

It took some time to nail down the settlement numbers on our side.  Legal 
spent some time with Freeman's attorney but got agreement on the EEI Form.  
Credit likes this a lot.    Tim will have Lavo wear the market exposure - 
$2MM if the market falls $100.  David Freeman said he would look at it Monday 
but it sounded good.  

I will pull it together and copy you over the weekend.

Chris

I am copying to you my note of last night to Mark and Rob. 

Email correspondence has been exchanged concerning support letters for EES companies in the UK, but the issue impacts all UK companies and also (given minor differences in legal regimes) those in all other European jurisdictions. 

Hopefully the conclusion now is that Corp feels able to give the standard support letters, and the additional comfort referred to in my note below. The consequences of Corp not being able to are fairly dire. 

Thanks.

Mark, Rob

My apologies for adding to your burden at this difficult time. However hopefully this might clarify our discussions of yesterday and enable us all to move on quickly.

Enron Europe and its directors are facing two related issues: 

1. Continuing to trade

The directors of EEL and its subsids have to be satisfied that there is a reasonable prospect of avoiding an insolvent liquidation. This is a fairly low hurdle to pass and, in our situation, calls made on Corp. for cash have been promptly met and we have read the news today of a new confirmed facility so we already have a fair degree of comfort. 

The directors meet with independent counsel tomorrow but I believe that they will probably come out of that session asking for nothing more than a confirmation, by email to say Michael Brown, but from the top - Jeff or Greg, of where they currently see things, ie a positive prognosis for the future. That piece of electronic paper should be enough to enable the directors to reasonably conclude that we are not hurtling into Chapt 11 and to continue to trade. It would also be very helpful if that email could confirm that Michael would be promptly informed if things took a downward turn.  

I would be happy to draft a note but wonder whether the best way of quickly putting this to bed might be for a conversation to be had with Jeff/Greg to see what they would be prepared to say. That could then be drafted up and sent over. 


2. Filing accounts

The directors of Enron Europe and its subsids cannot file accounts on a going concern basis unless they are comfortable they will have adequate funds in the medium term to run their businesses. The hurdle here is higher than in point 1 above as prospective cash shortages would require the accounts to be qualified long before the directors would have to stop trading under point 1 above. So more comfort will probably be required here, which could include further details of the new facility (drawdown conditions and maturity periods) and prospects for further facilities being signed. This would back up the usual support letter. 

I should add that we have not actually received this year the usual support letter from Corp. addressed to Enron Europe and its subsids. I don't know if it has been formally requested but we will definitely need to see that document this time around. Could you please point me in the right direction for that? 

We now have until the end of January to file the accounts so point 1 above is definitely the immediately crucial issue. We would however like to resolve the accounts issue as soon as possible. Perhaps we could liaise with Joel to get a letter drafted and then signed by Jeff or Greg? 


That's it. It really boils down to requiring a bit more information from Corp. There is absolutely no desire to cause problems here, just a desire to put in place the right pieces of information (which we are sure are out there but we need to collect them in) which will safeguard the European directors personally and enable them to move on from these concerns to the more pressing business of Q4. 

Many thanks.



								Mark

Subject: US Officials Dismiss Rumors Of Power Market Price Caps


  By Bryan Lee

  WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--Speculation that U.S. regulators would impose
price
caps on competitive power markets sent several sector stocks into a tumble
this
week.
  But officials with the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the
U.S.
Department of Energy Tuesday called the speculation unfounded.
  "We're not discussing (price controls)," said FERC Commissioner Curtis
Hebert.
  "This is the first I've heard of it," said FERC Commissioner William
Massey.
  "I am not aware and have not been involved in any discussion related to
generic application of price caps," Massey said.
  A senior Energy Department official dismissed a rumor that Energy
Secretary
Bill Richardson had asked FERC to consider price caps as a response to
potential power grid outages this summer.
  "We have not at all talked about price caps with FERC," the Energy
Department
official said, adding: "We do not intend to get involved in that issue."
  The comments came after shares of several companies active in the
converging
natural gas and power sectors took a severe hit Monday in response to
concerns
that the regulators would cap power prices, which would limit revenue from
gas-fired generation investments.
  Shares of Dynegy Inc. (DYN) dropped 8.6% on Monday, while Enron Corp.
(ENE)
and El Paso Energy Corp. (EPG) saw their stocks fall 4.9% and 5%. Calpine
Corp.
(CPN) took the hardest fall, losing 12% of its share value.
  Wall Street analysts attributed the sell-off to profit-taking and an
unfounded
reaction to speculation in a Prudential Securities note to investors
regarding
the potential for FERC to intervene in competitive power markets.
  The June article, written by Carol Coale, a Houston-based analyst with
Prudential, said FERC "is proposing to endorse price caps on electricity to
prevent brownouts and other reliability issues."
  Coale warned that this "could significantly limit the profitability" of
gas-fired generation investments by Dynegy, Enron, El Paso and Duke Energy
(DUK), which also saw share values tumble this week.
  These companies developing gas-fired power plants could see their
profitability affected "if the FERC were to actually take such action,"
Coale
wrote.

  (MORE) DOW JONES NEWS  06-06-00
  03:24 PM- - 03 24 PM EDT 06-06-00
  "My comments triggered a knee-jerk reaction," Coale said Tuesday.
  "It's interesting to see how one small comment gets blown up," she said.
  Coale joined other analysts Tuesday in saying investors overreacted, and
suggested that Monday's sell-off might present a good opportunity to buy the
companies' stocks.
  "We do not believe the government is interested in nationwide power price
caps," said James Yannello, an analyst with PaineWebber, in a note to
investors
Tuesday.
  "We see the recent pullback...as an excellent buying opportunity," Yanello
said.
  Coale said the ground was laid for Monday's stock dive when Dynegy issued
a
press release Friday urging FERC "to resist the temptation to endorse price
caps."
  The possibility of price caps was raised by Dynegy and others in response
to
FERC's May 17 notice seeking comments on actions the regulators can take
this
summer to assure power grid reliability.
  While those comments urged the commission against considering price
controls,
the mere discussion of capping the steep spikes in power prices during
transmission grid constraints spooked investors Monday.
  Massey, the FERC commissioner, noted that the commission has never imposed
price caps on the competitive wholesale power markets its regulations helped
bring about.
  FERC has imposed price caps only in certain markets for "ancillary
services,"
the term used for electricity generation necessary to assure grid
reliability,
Massey said.
  "The price caps at the wholesale level are few and far between, and for
the
most part are very generous," Massey said.
  The grid-reliability measures FERC proposed May 17 would allow industrial
generators to sell power into the grid at prevailing market rates, or to get
paid for not using electricity, during a grid-reliability emergency, Massey
noted.
  Hebert, the lone Republican commissioner who has consistently voted
against
the FERC majority Democrats in allowing the price caps, said the stock
market's
reaction this week validates his arguments against price controls.
  "Investors see their opportunity to earn being inhibited by FERC," Hebert
said. "This is evidence of what I've been talking about. Price controls
consistently inhibit the market."
  The stock performance of these companies will continue to be overshadowed
by
uncertainty until FERC announces its "final decision" on power grid
reliability, Coale said in a followup note to investors Tuesday.
  "While we do not see a trend for the FERC to re-regulate the wholesale
electricity market, we do see a trend in its propensity to approve temporary
price caps in certain illiquid markets," Coale said.

Joe, thanks for the message. It has been my experience that people who have 
had experience in our trading, mid market and structuring groups have a 
better overall understanding of how Enron (ECT or ENA) looks at value and 
manages risk.  Personally, this is the track I took which included a very 
solid foundation in accounting, operations, trading, structuring and then 
ultimately in origination.

I hope this helps.

Dave-

You mentioned in enside that some of the skills needed to succeed at Enron 
are solid structuring skills as well as a grasp of the the accounting, legal, 
commercial and credit implications of a deal.  What is the best way to obtain 
these skills?  Do you believe it is necessary or worthwhile to work a trading 
desk to truly understand how ENA functions?

Thanks,

Thanks for the note.  The concern was not over the timing of the receipt of funds but rather a comment which implied that Allegheny needed to raise the funds through an equity offering.  Is that a fair characterization and, if so, do you have any concerns over Allegheny's short term access to capital (i.e. what is their funding strategy if the equity markets continue to be rocky).  My concern is heightened by the bankruptcy filing of PCG which will most likely create a fair amount of volatility through the utility sector.

I appreciate your thoughts.

Ben,

I have heard through the grape vine that concerns were raised this morning at your staff meeting about the Allegheny closing.  Just to clarify, we have set May 3, 2001 as the closing date.  On that date we should receive $1,028,000.00 plus $10-15 million for reimbursement of some cost associated with a build out of a sub station. 

Let me know if you have any other questions.

Dave,

I know I should be generating money instead of spending it, but I would like 
your approval to spend $20K on four packages for this year's SuperBowl.  In 
lieu of a mass-market customer event, I would like to target certain decision 
makers that are involved in large transactions.  With that in mind, we would 
like to invite individuals from Black Hills (buyer of PSCo project), and 
either Avista or McCook Metals (buyer of Longview project).   Two Enron 
people (Parquet, Jake or I) would go with two executives.  In the past, West 
Power has signed up for 8+ packages - I have appropriately scaled it back, 
but I do think this type of selective client entertainment has value.

Regards,

Chris

Wow, if Haug spent more time making money than created bull.... in the 
company we would be a $100 stock.

On a different note, I was wondering if someone in your shop could map the 
current A&A process from planning for on-campus recruitment to manager 
promotion  for the typical associate including timeline.  This process 
mapping should be very detailed to give us the greatest insight.

I think radical change is not the answer.  The answer lies in a combination 
of a) slight changes in process; b) increasing participation/ownership at key 
points in the process by certain business units and people; and c) a credible 
key business spokesman or spokespersons co-opting the other units where 
necessary and providing the commercial leadership and representation for the 
program internally. Overall this is a commercial program that needs to meet 
commercial objectives - the closer to the front the better.

The goals of any restructuring are:
 a) eliminate the perception that the program is not receptive to the 
business units needs or any bu's perception that they lack ownership for the 
program;
 b) increase the quality of the recruits that are brought in and retained;
 c) ensure we have the best people in the organization recruiting, selling 
and interviewing;
 d) ensure that we have the best commercial training program that firmly 
grounds the associate in the "Enron technology" which include skills in 
market understanding, structuring, finance, logistics and risk;
 e) ensure the business units have the ability to identify the outstanding 
talent early and give those people the responsibility necessary to move them 
up the curve quickly (ie) quickly identify the Whalley/Lavorato's in the 
program and, on the flip side, quickly deal with clear non-performance issues;
 f) review the effectiveness of the current PRC process as a development, 
retention and performance tool;
 g) incorporate mid-year flexibility, internet recruiting techniques, 
non-traditional sources of talent and
 h) increase cost effectiveness.

The solutions may include mandated participation by certain business units, 
people and teams, business tracks, etc.

I think a thorough process mapping/tracking can identify (or help me see) the 
key spots for change/modification/ownership that reach these goals with the 
least amount of wholesale change for the sake of change.

I think we need to get back to Jeff not next week but the following week with 
a strawman.

Let me know your thoughts.

Here is how the UT candidates fared at Super Saturday. 9 of 17 got offers (   
others are coming to future Super Saturdays). This result is obviously 
disappointing - - -  65% of  the 55 students from all schools got offers.   I 
will be getting more info on why the other 8 were not well received.  If 
anyone thinks a manifest injustice or mistake has occurred let me know.  
Ditto if you think anyone's prior background makes them a candidate for a 
direct hire - - -i.e., not in the associate program.
     On the "yeses", please let me know who you would like to follow up on 
and encourage to accept.  We will try to do this by volunteers: more than one 
per student is OK, and each of you should select one or two. When you talk to 
them, get their feedback on Super Saturday and the whole process. If anyone 
wants to call any of the "no's", to commisserate, that's OK too. - - -DLH

Subject: NBP, L.P. 2Q earnings release


	

Attached is a VERY ROUGH first draft of the NBP 2Q earnings and distribution 
declaration press release and financial table.

We have made several changes to the format, based on comments and requests 
from previous releases.  First, we are comparing 2Q to 1Q 2000 in the opening 
paragraph, as the comparison is more favorable.  We do mention 2Q 2000 to 2Q 
1999 further down in the body of the release.   We have also added operating 
cash flow per unit at the suggestion of one of our executive staff.   
Finally, we have added a paragraph detailing the analyst conference call at 
the suggestion of our Investor Relations group.  

Please provide your comments to me by noon, Monday, July 17 to incorporate 
into the second draft.  We have scheduled this for release on Wednesday, July 
19 after the market closes, so your prompt response is appreciated..

Thanks for your cooperation in moving this along.

Guys, I spoke with Mark this morning.  He is very supportive of the structure 
and idea.  I had indicated that he would continue to run the producer 
services business in the West but would also be part of the overall team as 
we plot out strategy in the West.  He wants to stay in Denver which I think 
we should be able to accomodate as long as his group stays integrated into 
the overall team.  I had indicated that we would consolidate market making 
into Houston and Paul Lucci could decide if he wants to continue trading or 
not - if so he needs to move to Houston.

 Phillip/Barry, go ahead and start working with Mark as you develop your 
plans going forward.  I will be speaking to Stephanie Miller this week and 
will give the green light with her shortly.

Dave,

The back office is having a hard time dealing with the $11 million dollars 
that is to be recognized as transport expense by the west desk then recouped 
from the Office of the Chairman.    Is your understanding that the West desk 
will receive origination each month based on the schedule below.

 
 The Office of the Chairman agrees to grant origination to the Denver desk as 
follows:

October 2000  $1,395,000
November 2000 $1,350,000
December 2000 $1,395,000
January 2001  $   669,600
February 2001  $   604,800
March 2001  $   669,600
April 2001  $   648,000
May 2001  $   669,600
June 2001  $   648,000
July 2001  $   669,600
August 2001  $   669,600
September 2001 $   648,000
October 2001  $   669,600
November 2001 $   648,000
December 2001 $   669,600

This schedule represents a demand charge payable to NBP Energy Pipelines by 
the Denver desk.  The demand charge is $.18/MMBtu on 250,000 MMBtu/Day 
(Oct-00 thru Dec-00) and 120,000 MMBtu/Day (Jan-01 thru Dec-01).  The ENA 
Office of the Chairman has agreed to reimburse the west desk for this expense.

Let me know if you disagree.

Phillip

Jeff, I don't believe the offer I showed you of $39 M is unreasonable. In 
fact the team had recommended $42 M based on a number of measures.  I see the 
6X multiple of annualized Q2 earnings as one of the best measures of the 
potential value of this company.

I don't see it in the best interests of Enron to be transferring assets below 
a reasonable market value between business units.  You can trust that I will 
be keeping the Energy Capital Resources team's feet to the fire on the 
realization of this value if you do not purchase the company.

If you and Steve can come up with a better indication of value, I will 
support that transaction.

Subject: C-Gas

Dave,  I have ask Steve Harper, Jack Harmuth, Howard Selzer,and  Glenn Fox to 
work with Steve Pruitt and see if the number you offered can be supported.  
The value for proved developed reserves and the financial/legal issues can be 
reviewed rather painlessly here in Houston.  The value for the  proved 
undeveloped reserves will most likely require a visit to the working team to 
see the program particulars, verify the acreage and , concluded the validity 
of this estimate of PUD value.  The idea of paying before tax NPV10% for an 
assumed 3.5 year program on top of the PD &PUD reserves will require a more 
indepth review.  

Obviously, we want to do this as simply as possible and I was prepared to 
take the package "as is, where is" at book value which I understood to be in 
the 30-32MM$ range including debt.  Dave I understand what you are doing and 
I would support this effort if we were selling the asset outside of the 
company.   I want to do what is best for Enron at this time which I believe 
is to transfer this asset to EGEP for the reasons i outlined in my prior 
memo.  It will benefit C-gas via direct access to technology and specialists, 
it will benefit EGEP for marketing and a US presence and it will benefit ENA 
by moving the asset from your books without a loss and releasing the valuable 
intellectual capital ENA could employ elsewhere in a higher yielding business 
venture.  However, with the premiums you have placed on the properties it is 
going to be very difficult to make this transaction happen.  (However, we are 
willing to try)  ENA has had this on the market for over a year with the 
intent to sell it at book if possible.  Prices have improved, but I believe 
even your team would admit this is still a project to get book in the market 
today.  Your estimated value at the current strip at a Before Tax 10% 
discount for Appalachian reserves seems a little aggressive for the market 
let alone an inter-company transfer.  

When we talked about this a couple of weeks ago we said it would be a fair 
transaction and at the time you were hedging that it would be around book.  I 
understood your logic for needing to talk with your team but I was relying on 
a fair deal to result.  Dave, I'm only sending this memo to you because I 
feel this is being pushed way past fair by your team with the intent that if 
we pay this it is a home run for your new team and since we are in a bind, 
let's see what happens.  I know this is a very small piece of business for 
you and the time it takes to read this is more than you can afford to this 
asset or transaction.  If fact,  the easy thing for you to do is get mad and 
say you don't have the time and stop the transaction.  On the other hand, if 
you believe the right thing for all parties is to do this at book, say so and 
you'll never deal with this piece of business again.  I hope in this case you 
will put the greater good of Enron in front of ENA's desire to hit a home run 
at EGEP's expense and in the spirit of ONE-ENRON move these assets to EGEP at 
book value.  
As I said in the beginning we will try to get to your number, but I am 
concerned that we will spend a lot of time and require effort from all of the 
teams that could be eliminated if you and I decided to make this transaction 
at book.  In fact, it would be the easiest transition for the C-Gas team 
which you've indicated to be a concern for your team.  I am available through 
voice mail and I can get my lotus notes most days.  Best thing is to leave a 
voice mail and a good time for me to call you back.

Thanks Dave for your time,
Jeff

Dave,  I met with my team today and based on the data and information 
supplied by Steve, it is doubtful that the assets and on-going organization 
would command a current market value equivalent to book.  I am still willing 
to move the assets onto our balance sheet at book for the benefit of Enron, 
although if this was a third party bid, I would be surprised if we could pay 
this price.  Furthermore, due to your desire to maintain this discussion 
among the Houston teams only, I am assuming the PDP reserves are solid, no 
major enviornmental issues exit, legal problems are minimal and contracts are 
standard.  Let me know what you want to do. I think we have all spent enough 
time on this effort. 

On a side issue, are you aware that this is a JEDI I property?  My 
understanding is that Jedi I owns 100% of C-GAS and the Jedi I fund WILL be 
liquidated before the end of the year.  At what price will your unit pay to 
liquidate the fund?

Thanks for the e-mail.  I wasn't trying to be critical of anyone specifically, and I think Dick is doing an admirable job.  I will give him high marks at PRC.  However, one position that has lost a significant amount of value since we were free to sell it is Avici.  Do you think that at PRC, this "loss" of value, which does not show up in a P/L since it is hedged by Raptor, should be taken into account when we evaluate the person?  My point is only that each of these investments are "positions" that should be "owned" by someone, like a book.  Hickerson didn't get evaluated on Avici because it didn't show up in a P/L (even though he lost a lot of value).  What do we do with Garland?  Now it has lost a lot of value again.  If Dick could sell an asset for a 10% loss today, but doesn't, and we eventually lose 30% upon disposition, how do you evaluate the performance?

Tim,

Dave Delainey is looking for a target customer list, coverage metrics and 
goal and objectives for each of your teams:

 West Power Trading
 West Power Mid-Market/Services
 West Power Fundamentals/Structuring

Obviously his proposed breakout of your teams (noted above) is different from 
the way we planned them.  For expense purposes, do you want me to add Volume 
Management, Real-Time, Pre-Scheduling and Admins to West Power Trading?  

Unfortunately, we have a tight deadline because Delainey is looking for this 
information by the end of the week.  Do you think you can provide this 
information to me by Thursday?  Also, if you could let me know today about 
the expense breakout, I can start working on that now.

Thanks, Paula.

Hey Dick, I don't want to beat a dead horse here, but I did want to reiterate 
out need for  the GE 7FA's  for our Florida projects. Although I understood 
from you that Goldendale was effectively done, I understand that you haven't 
yet gone through the dash process, so therefore a window of opportunity. We 
are looking to pay up to $40,000,000 for a GE 7FA for Ft. Pierce in addition 
to a commitment on the combined-cycle EPC contract. Our customer at Ft. 
Pierce is heavily engaged in finalizing contracts and will be prepared to 
execute in December. We must be able to commit to them (showing title to the 
que position) by then. 

I'd like you to compare your anticipated earnings on the Goldendale deal with 
earnings from moving this turbine to Florida. The $40 million should give you 
app. $3 million above cost, as well as incremental profits from the EPC 
contract. Also, you should know that we feel the Florida market has 
significant upside potential for Enron from a merchant standpoint and 
anticipate that our first-mover advantage will result in significant earnings.

Please let me know how you think Enron should proceed in comparing the two 
projects. Thanks Dick.

Dave --

Sorry for the delay in responding.  Dorie has been out after surgery and I 
wanted to talk with her first.  Attendance is an issue that can be addressed 
via a few initiatives, including:

1) better up-front communication from the Office of the Chair through the 
direct supervisors (like we did for United Way last year)
2) entertainment/big-name draw added to the line-up
3) IP-TV as a back-up for those who cannot attend
4) select a better time than last year's meeting (i.e., morning meetings have 
been better attended in the past vs. last year's afternoon meeting)

There are no doubt other small changes we can make to enhance attendance, but 
this should get us headed in the right direction.  Dorie and I would be happy 
to sit down and discuss this with you.

Regardless of what we do to increase attendance, if we wish to do such a 
meeting, we need to pick a date and get on the Hyatt calendar soon.  Their 
calendar is filling up quickly.  Thanks.

have a meeting; however, the challenge is getting people to show up - any 
thoughts on this Eric/Dorie?

Dave and John --

In the past, ENA has held an all-employee business meeting over at the Hyatt 
in April or May.  Do you plan to hold such a meeting?  If so, we need to get 
started on planning the event.  Dorie Hitchcock has typically handled the 
arrangements.  Please advise.

Eric

Dave,

Here is the list of folks involved in Cuiaba.

Laine Powell and his team - Project execution team for Cuiaba, located in 
Cuiaba
Jose Anson - Develpment -  Engineering/Permitting
Joan Carlos Albuquerque - FURNAS/Eletrobra relationship
Valeria Lima - ANP relationship
Daine Duarte - Local in Cuiaba.  Sounds like formally part of Lammers' team, 
but practically part of Laine's team
Jose Lucio dos Reis Neto - Agencies involved in electric system operation.  
Recovery oil fuel oil costs (complicated story/very important task)
Jose Bestard - Project continuity.  Original PPA negotiations
John Novak - Lawyer...key to financing
Rob Gay - Financing lead...key to financing
Rick Lammers - Commercial project lead

I sent this on top of Pete Weidler's e-mail and summarized a good part of it 
above.  Only Lammers and Gay were not mentioned in Pete's e-mail.

Another thought...pull people in from EE&CC as part of the "new team".  No 
basis in fact here, but I suspect there are too many contractor/owner games 
going on.  Probably need the EE&CC key people list as well.  Do you want me 
to shake it loose, do you want to work it with Leff, or bad idea?

Let me know if you have any additional questions.

Thanks,

KIsh

Joe - this is the list I asked Laine to put together. - I asked him not to 
list all the folks under Laine - as I assume they stay with the project no 
matter where it goes.


Jose Anson - he is the coordinator of permitting at IBAMA and ANP for the 
pipeline.  He is also involved with working on the FUNAI issues a result of 
his efforts on the IBAMA license.  Key person.

Joao Carlos A. - although he is working on the project on an ad hoc basis he 
is key in terms of the FURNAS/Eletrobras relationship.  Not only does he know 
folks but he also gets things done within the system.

Valeria Lema - She is the relationship manager with ANP.

Daiane Duarte - Daiane Duarte is on the PanEng payroll until the end of the 
year after which she has been dialed out.  Have asked Rick several times 
about her future with his group.  She is critical locally in Cuiaba due to 
relations with FEMA and other agencies for obtaining the state permits that 
are still outstanding as well as working with Anson et al.

Lucio Reis - he is very active in working with ANEEL/ONS/MAE and others.  He 
has been a key to our success on the CCC account.  He is a must to making the 
project successful.  Knows the contacts and basically understands the project 
from the regulatory and CCC account point-of-view.

Two other people that are not involved in "our side" of fence on a daily 
basis but are valuable are Jose Bestard and John Novak.  Jose knows the 
history and John is the counsel with the longest tenure on the project.

Rebecca has asked for a review of the Cuiaba project.   Her current thinking 
is that it should be under one shop - not split responsibility.   Which shop 
is not clear to me - I presume this will be decided pretty soon.

The review will take place the week of Dec 4th.   She wants a straight 
forward  decription of what is left to be done and what the issues are.  I am 
thinking the presenters are Laine, Rick, Jose.  In attendance are Rob and 
John.     Can divide the presentation up into - 

getting the construction finished/cost issues/EECC - subcontractor issues. - 
Laine 
Furnas/Electrobras issues - Rick 
YPF - gas supply - Mark to market position - opportunities - Rick
MAE/ONS issues - current thinking.  - Jose
Current economics. - Rick

Everyone should have a page prepared ahead of time with the discussion topics 
on it - she doesn't want a detailed presentation - just the facts.   Can we 
send the page per topic around by this friday.  

I will ask Rebecca for two hours the week of the 4th and let you know.

Joe - we should talk about where the project should best end up - I think 
Rebecca is flexible -   don't really know what Dave is thinking.

Body:
We intend to reserve $5.5 million associated with PX Index-based deals with third parties that we did in January.  The $5.5 million represents the amount by which we underpaid some of our services customers relative to the PX index.  NO P&L IMPACT.  Amounts currently sitting as annuities in Enpower.  We should release this reserve when the California refund case is completed and new/final PX MCPs are published by FERC.

The story goes like this ... We typically buy power from our services customers at a PX Index price.  Throughout January we entered PX Index based purchases from our services customers into Enpower.  At the same time, Foster was negotiating a certain $150/MWh payment to our customers given all of the noise around the PX, the weird prices that it was printing, and the $150/MWh soft price cap that FERC had in place.  We settled with our customers based on the $150 value.  Most of our customers were fine with this.  To do this we entered annuities into Enpower for the difference between the PX price and the $150 price.  These annuities have been "hanging out there" since January.  We should have run those annuities through the books and reserved the amount when we settled with our customers (I am assured by Foster and Postelthwaite that we have properly settled with our customers).  Somewhere between our middle market team and our risk group in Portland the annuities were never run through the books (you may recall that we lost two of our three people on our risk desk at this same time).  Foster or Wolfe should have caught this.

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Dear all,

Just a heads-up to everyone, the Risk will reserve $5,518,289.90 on 10/31/01 in the ST-CA books regarding the following four annuity deals:

#566310	$1,885,593.81
#566307	$1,383,042.10
#566313	$1,539,749.09
#566377	$   709,904.90
Total		$5,518,289.90

As discussed earlier, since these deals have never come through to ST-CA book, we will give this value back to ST-CA while reserving it at the same time. Therefore, there will be NO P&L impact for ST-CA. 

Tracy,

We are treating this just like the way we discussed in the last email (10/24). Therefore, you should be able to take them out from the LTD report in Nov.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

we may have an opportunity to buy either 10 or 20 years worth of transmission from the northwest (john day) to COB.  we currently own roughly 170 MW of this under a long term deal with wapa that was assigned to epmi from pge back in 1998.

here's a summary of the facts on the new transmission
100 to 200 MW for either 10 or 20 years
purchase at prevailing pge rates -- if rates go up our payments go up.
monthly demand charge equal to roughly $1.10/MWh.  this equates to roughly $80k per month per 100 MW of transmission.
npv of the cost of the transmission (not value but cost) is $10 million per 100 MW for 20 years.
the spreads from nw to cob are roughly $2.50 on peak and $1.00 off peak.  line losses are roughly $0.75/MWh.
this transmission helps our cash, real time and services desks in addition to whatever value swerzbin extracts.
pge has the lowest tariff rates for intertie transmission.  can't guarantee that it will stay that way but is likely.
transmission rights would convert to an ftr if/when rto is implemented.
mike and i both want to do this transaction.
what do you think?
do we need to dash this?
we need to get this done by October 31.

IMPORTANT EPMI POLICY REGARDING HARD COPY DOCUMENTS
WHILE LITIGATION IS PENDING

This policy is in addition to my prior email about the procedure for
handling email and electronic documents.  While most of what we do is
contained within Enron's electronic systems, there still are times when hard
copies are made or needed for running our business.  Here is how you must
handle those hard copy documents:

1. The basic rule is that if you have hard copies of documents that are
used in EPMI's business of selling energy in the WSCC, you must keep those
documents until further notice.  If space becomes a problem, please contact
Debra Davidson who can arrange for storage.

2. What constitutes a document?  In some instances you will have one
copy of a document that has your handwritten notes on it, and another copy
that may be clean.  For these purposes both are considered documents and
both must be saved.  Similarly, if several people have copies of the same
document, each separate copy is considered a separate document.  On the
other hand, if you made 10 copies for a meeting and there were 4 left over
that were never handed out or were not used, those may be recycled so long
as you keep the ones that were used.   If you keep handwritten notes for
your work, those would be considered documents as well.  Telephone notes,
charts, printouts of data, spreadsheets etc. all constitute documents.   If
you have a question about what constitutes a document and whether it should
be saved, please ask Christian Yoder and Steve Hall.

3. The goal and purpose of this policy is to make sure that no hard
copies of documents are discarded that are relevant to the wholesale
electricity market litigation.  If hard copy documents are discarded, at a
later point in time EPMI and/or its employees will be criticized for failing
to preserve documents relevant to the wholesale electricity litigation.

4. Personal documents such as shopping lists, personal messages from
friends unrelated to the energy business etc. are not covered by this policy
and you may do with them as you wish.

Subject: Monthly Mid Market Coverage Report

Dave:

I want to be sure I am on the right track for providing you ,John and Kevin 
with meaningful account coverage data. I envision a one page 
summary that provides you with a monthly and quarterly sub-region coverage 
ratio. I propose that the quarterly coverage standard be set 
at 100%. The monthly coverage standard would be at least 50%. These standards 
would drive consistent, ongoing coverage of commercially 
active customers. Less active or inactive customers would be contacted at 
least once a quarter to determine status changes and propose 
product structures. This reporting format would also place emphasis on each 
commercial team's coverage effectiveness or lack thereof.  I will 
derive this summary from a master customer list that will show contact dates 
and specific comments on customer status. I anticipate this master 
list to be 20-25 pages. I propose to provide you a copy of the master list 
quarterly in order to corroborate the monthly summary. Do my proposed 
coverage standards and reporting format meet your expectations?

In addition, I have asked my commercial teams to prepare regional business 
plans by July 12. A primary component of these plans will be
identification of major new business initiatives by sub-region. Tammy 
Shepperd asked me to provide you with an initial report this week. I 
don't want to provide you with something "half-baked".  Is it acceptable to 
allow my commercial teams to complete their plans then provide
you with our suggested initiatives by July 13 ? 

Finally, I have provided Tammy with reports on 1st/2nd quarter completed 
transactions plus a deal flow "hot list" .

Sorry for being verbose. Please advise. 

Thanks,     Ed

Body:
Here are some more thoughts:
FERC should take a hard look at why the ISO is almost always in an "inc" 
situation in real time.  Without structural incentives to go short into real 
time, I would expect the CAISO to "inc" in some hours and "dec" in others -- 
with no consistent patterns.
The IOU's have four choices for purchasing power:  PX Block Forward, PX Day 
Ahead, PX Day Of, and CAISO Ex Post.  They had ample opportunity to purchase 
lower cost power in the PX Block Forward but didn't buy enough.  That left 
them short in the Day Ahead.  They can reduce Day Ahead prices by moving some 
of their load to the Ex Post market.  Dave Parquet did an Econ 101 
presentation on this incentive at the CAISO board meeting in June.
The ISO remains primarily in "inc" mode even during the shoulder months when 
prices are lower, another indicator that the real time "inc" problem is 
driven by the load side rather than the supply side.  The IOU's continue to 
go short into the ISO Ex Post market even when the CAISO Ex Post price is 
consistently above the PX Day Ahead price.
There is evidence that the IOU's are not willing to pay above the CAISO price 
cap for energy from the PX in the Day Ahead market.  Does it matter that the 
price cap for the ISO also acts as a PX price cap?
The NOx market in California is very tight.  How has this contributed to 
higher costs and has the complete lack of available NOx credits prevented any 
generators from running?
How large was the impact of the below normal water year on the supply side?  
The attached presentation quantifies this effect in the Northwest.  (I have a 
theory on how hydro capacity completely overstates reserve margins in the 
west from an economic perspective.  I can go into more detail if you wish.)
Friction between California PX and ISO markets and other western markets.  
For example, why are actual flows going into the state yet prices out side of 
the state are higher?  Another example of anomylous behavior is at COB on 
8/11 and 8/12.  There was congestion from California TO the northwest those 
days in the Day Ahead market.  In real time the NW ended up being a net 
seller of about 3,000 MW from the NW TO California.
Demand Side - we really need to press on this issue because all of the 
proponents of price caps claim that as soon as the demand side is "workably 
competitive" then there is no need for price caps.  Is large-scale economic 
demand response required for a competitive market?  What if demand response 
is there, but at very high prices?  The demand response in California is a 
joke.  With 2700 MW of interuptible, why did the utilities and the CAISO only 
get around 600 MW of economic demand response.  Much of this response comes 
at $1500/MWh.  The assymetric treatment of supply side resources and demand 
side resources can be justified on environmental grounds, but not economic 
grounds.  So why this assymetric treatment?  This gets to the question of the 
fine line between "scarcity rents" which are ok, and market power which is 
not.  If power is scarce, and demand truly values it at $1500/MWh then 
shouldn't that be the price.  At what price would the rest of the 
interuptible load economically curtail?  Bottom line -- there are about 2,000 
MW of load that should be able to respond to price signals that chooses not 
to or values power at more than $1500/MWh.
Burden of proof -- what empirical measures should be used to assess market 
power?  The reports published to date have been unimpressive.  The Market 
Analysis Unit report, for example, does a bunch of handwaving and then 
concludes that there is market power.  But they never explain why.  I would 
think that proof might be something like this:  Generator X sets price y% of 
the time when loads exceed Z MWs.  Or, four generators set price 80% of the 
time when prices exceed $200/MWh.  They have all the data to be able to tell, 
yet they don't provide any empirical measures.  The only test I've heard of 
so far is the UC Energy Institute report that demonstrates that generators 
are submitting bids above their marginal cost.  The PX report states that 
supply bids are fewer and at higher prices than last year.  They fail to 
mention the fact that there are 5,000 fewer MW of hydro this year relative to 
last.

Subject: FERC INVESTIGATION IN CA - What should they be looking for?

As we begin to meet with FERC Staff on the Wholesale market issues related to 
CA problems, I think that we need to put together a list of questions that 
FERC needs to be asking Western power market participants.  

The following are some questions that I think are important to have FERC ask; 
I'm sure there are more.

1. Were California utilities underscheduling load into the PX day ahead 
market?  
2. How many MWs did the CA ISO procure during each hour during the Summer 
2000?  How does this compare with CA ISO procurement during 1999?
3. Has PG&E changed its bidding behavior associated with its Hydro facilities 
in 2000?  
3. Are there baseload facilities that were operated differently in 2000 than 
in 1999?
4. Were any generation plants off-line due to unplanned maintenance during 
Summer 2000?
5. How did the CA ISO demand side program work?  Why didn't more load 
participate?  
6. What options did SDG&E have to "hedge" its retail rates?  What were prices 
in the CAL PX block forward market on Jan 15, 2000 and May 15, 2000?
7. How high did natural gas prices go in California for generation during 
Summer 2000?
8. Were other Western power markets prices higher (year-on-year)?
9. Did the CA ISO Board face political pressure to reduce bid caps?  Is this 
appropriate for a FERC jurisdictional entity?
10. What specific details is SDG&E referring to in its Complaint on 
"unworkably competitive" CA ISO markets?  Can these be fixed "quickly"?

Please add other questions.

Jim

As we continue to define goals/objectives and coverage staffing in alignment

origination would fall within the central region.  Specifically opportunities 
with Enbridge, Consumers and Union due to mid-market/trading coverage 
previously being at the central desk.  I understand there is history to this 
division and I have no desire to start any new issues or create larger 
organizational issues.   In the gas re-organization, how did you 
strategically divide Eastern Canada?

I would appreciate your direction or decision.

Dave, we are in the process of making offers to two individuals in Toronto 
for the purposes of covering gas marketing reporting to Eric Le Dain. Lavo 
and I discussed mid-year last year that we needed someone to cover the 
utilities and someone to cover industrials. It has been a difficult hiring 
process, but we are now there.  I would envision both of these marketers 
working closely with Storey on mid-market transactions with Eric's 
involvement on structured/originated transactions.

Guys, I can't recall how the corporate opportunity is managed between Canada 
and the US for these customers particularily with regard to their 
transactions in Michigan et al.  Is Eastern Canada now managed by the Central 
desk from a trading and mid-market point of view since Story came down to 
Houston? How are the structured deals managed?  Is this still the right split 
for the business?

Subject: MEH Quarter Success

Hat's off to the group for a very successful quarter for MEH.  I graciously 
commend everyone for the teamwork and perseverance displayed in tackling the 
array of transactions and tasks to ensure the successful start of our new 
joint business.  We continue to have many challenges ahead, but I wanted to 
take pause and in particular commend the following:

Trunkline Transaction Team - Roy Rodriguez, Russell Murrell, and Steve Curlee 
brought to closure a significant transaction with leveraged off many groups 
in the PEC and Enron organizations.  Net transaction mark to market on behalf 
of MEH was $2,286,634  with accrual and option values to be realized over the 
3 year term of the arrangement.  Team work permeated this transaction and 
thanks are due to 1) legal teams for PEC led by Mary Klyasheff and for ENA 
led by Sheila Tweed and Jeff Hodge 2) structuring group support from Steve 
Curlee,  Deirdre McCaffrey and Ed McMichael 3) Tony Compton for the 
successful closure of gas supply transactions with third parties 4) to all 
else who covered the many transaction closing issues and bookings. 
NSS and NGPL Capacity Transaction Team - Steve Richman, Roy Rodriguez, 
Richard Tomaski, Barbara Dillard and Lee Fascetti successfully proposed, 
negotiated and are now managing a 3 year storage and capacity management of 
approximately 18 BCF/year of NGPL no-notice storage and accompanying 
transportation with realized value year to date for MEH of $1,510,459  with 
an additional $1,541,835  of value to PGL ratepayers.  This transaction will 
continue to be a significant asset to leverage into the intra-day market  and 
our initial platform for on-line business (EOL).
Daily Optimization - Richard Tomaski, Barbara Dillard, Steve Richman, Tim 
Hermann, Cary Carrabine and Lee Fascetti , diligently pursued and completed 
other significant transactions for MEH totalling $1,252,584 for this 
quarter.  Richard Tomaski and Kevin Radous have spent endless amounts of time 
(and evenings/weekends) to ensure that MEH had a P&L to represent for the 
groups hard work and my many thanks extend to both.
Business Set-up - Tim Hermann, Roy Rodriguez, Paul Burgener, Gregg Penman, 
Kevin Radous, Richard Tomaksi, and Barbara Dillard have toiled diligently and 
continue to proceed in contracts/policy and procedures between PEC/ENA/PGL 
and third parties. Additional thanks are due to all groups within accounting, 
economics, and trading within PEC and ENA in support of this new business and 
we ask for your continued engagement.

Over the next month, we must get closure on the remaining requirements of 
running a tightly managed and successful business venture.  We must continue 
to take our ideas and strategies to financially successful commercial 
operation .  Momentum is now on our side...

Thanx,

Laura

Subject:	EES/ENA Customer Split

Tim:

As we discussed, speaking on behalf of trading (not origination) our preferred approach to dividing the Western Region customer base into EES and ENA categories would be to "let the market decide."   Under this approach, EES would be free to contact any customer they wanted as we would.  The customers will elect if they want to do a transaction with EES or ENA..

That said, this approach is not meant to be an antagonistic one.  We would be focusing on larger accounts (generators and load) in excess of 1 MW who want to pre-schedule.  We will not be offering a burner-tip solution that includes our having load risk or paying transmission and distribution.  If customers want that, we will be forwarding the lead to EES, probably to Doug Condon.  We would expect EES to do the same thing.  I have worked with Doug Condon in the past.  Once management has blessed this approach, I will call Doug and clarify how we want the approach to work.  Let me know if you find out that he is the "right" contact person.

The beauty of this approach is that it is clean.  The negative is that customers might be contacted by more than one Enron employee.  I think that is OK, however, as there are good reasons for that.  Our two companies offer two distinct approaches.  We should be making customers aware of this fact when we explain possible solutions and let them decide what is best for them. 

Let me know if this approach is ultimately adopted.

Thanks

Chris

Subject: FOR IMMEDIATE REVIEW: Agreement Restricting Power Generation 
Competition in Asia Pacific Region

General Counsels -

At the direction of the Enron APACHI Office of the Chairman, I am sending 
this e-mail to you pursuant to the Enron Corp. Policy on Noncompetition.  I 
would appreciate if you would check with your CEO/COO regarding this e-mail 
and respond to me by Friday, September 29 if you have questions or concerns.  
Enron APACHI may need to commit to the following provisions (that bind Enron 
affiliates) by Monday, October 2.

Given the consolidating power generation market in Asia Pacific, Enron Asia 
Pacific/Africa/China (Enron APACHI) is proposing to enter into a transaction 
with Marubeni and Sithe Asia to combine the respective power generation 
portfolios into a single company (Newco).  Newco would be charged with making 
the shareholders' investments as liquid as possible to allow for sale of the 
shareholders' respective stakes in Newco.  

The shareholders believe that Newco must not be seen by the market as a 
"dumping ground" for existing power projects but rather as the vehicle 
through which the investors will continue to pursue power generation 
opportunities in Asia.  As a result, Enron APACHI proposes to include 
competition restrictions in the Marubeni/Enron Shareholder Agreement that 
would bind their respective affiliates.  

The following is a summary of these competition provisions:

Enron affiliates (with the exceptions stated below) could only develop or own 
power projects in the Asia Pacific Region (as defined below) after first 
offering the opportunity to Newco.  If Newco declines the opportunity, Enron 
would be free to own the project itself or offer the project to third parties 
provided that the terms do not materially improve.  Development or ownership 
does not include the provision of construction, O&M, offtaker or risk 
management services.

There are a number of exceptions to this rule:  (a) small projects involving 
20 MW or less; (b) projects in which Enron owns less than a 1/3 interest; (c) 
projects initiated by our SK joint venture; (d) Korean projects using natural 
gas produced by Enron; (e) projects obtained in a corporate acquisition in 
which Asia generation is less than 20% of the value of the acquisition; and 
(f) situations in which any Enron company would be exposed to fiduciary 
liability to another shareholder in complying with the competition 
restriction.

"Affiliates" will be defined to exclude Enron affiliates which are 
publicly-owned (e.g., Azurix).

"Asia Pacific Region" will be defined to include Brunei, China (including 
Hong Kong and Macau), South Korea, North Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, Laos, 
Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar, the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, East 
Timor, Singapore, Papua New Guinea and the Pacific Islands (including Guam, 
Saipan, the Federated States of Micronesia, and Fiji, but excluding Hawaii).  
It does not include Japan and Australia.

The competition clause would survive until the earlier of (a) Enron selling 
its interest in Newco or (b) December 31, 2003.

Thank you,
Bruce Lundstrom, General Counsel, Enron APACHI

Paula and Rex - I have mentioned this several times in the past several weeks, but have not received an answer.  Isn't it time to significantly adjust our 16b list?  There is clearly a new management team making the key decisions, and with all of the frequent Board meetings, it should be easy to do.  Thanks.  MEK

I know how incredibly busy you all are, so I'm sure that making a pledge to Jeff for the MS150 has simply slipped your mind.  Well the ride is this weekend, time is running out and we need you!

Enron's goal is to raise $700,000, and Jeff's personal goal is to raise $50,000.  As of today, we are a little better than half way there.  Won't you consider helping him reach his goal?

Thanks for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing from you tomorrow...

I just wanted to touch base and make sure you had everything thing you need for tomorrow morning.  I'm attaching a map to the North Shepherd facility; it's about 10 minutes outside of downtown.  I would be happy to make arrangements for a sedan to pick you up if you like; just let me know from where.

I'll be at the North Shepherd facility beginning about 2:00 p.m. CDT today, so you can reach me on my cell phone (713.854.1426).  Do not hesitate to call me should you have any questions or need additional information as I will not have access to e-mail after 2:00 p.m.

David, I have a problem with the RAC comments made on page #2 of the DASH.  
Specifically, the two paragraphs basically add no value and just confuse the 
reader (ie) what is your opinion?  Is this a good sale or can significant 
recovery (on a risk adjusted basis) occur if we convert the sub debt and 
infuse more equity?  Are we not receiving enough value from the CFPC given 
the possible recovery of this sector?  

The DASH is deficient in its view of Basic's prospects given current energy 
prices.

Jeff/Dick/Ray, what are your opinions?

Independent of the desire to move on - what is the right call - I do not want 
to give value away in any divestiture or restructuring.

After talking with Dan, I intend to set up a meeting to provide complete matrices on licensing and utility contracts sometime early during the week beginning Dec 3.  

Also, just to make sure everyone is clear, Harry, Gloria, and Rebecca are on point during the next few weeks to ensure that that EES and/or EPMI responds timely to any request for info, additional security, or other utility matters.  This, of course, will continue to require help from legal, credit, and operations.

If anyone has any other questions, please give me a call.

Jim / Evan - 

As you are probably aware, the performance and surety bond market is difficult for us to navigate in and around in our current situation.  As an example, EFS has been shut out of getting access to new bid and performance / payments bonds for its business that requires these.  We are addressing this with the bonding companies now.  All of their existing bonds are in place and in force.

In light of this, I wanted to make sure that we are absolutely current in all aspects of all bonding requirements with UDC's and LDC's.

Please send me the most current copy of your matrix that illustrates where we have existing bonds in place, what drives the capacity requirements, status, renewal / expiration date, current payment status, etc.  I would like to make sure that we are all clear on how these work, what triggers increases / decreases in capacity, and other issues impacting our ability to continue to flow electricity and natural gas to our clients.

Thanks - Dan

Dave --

Sorry for the delay in responding.  Dorie has been out after surgery and I 
wanted to talk with her first.  Attendance is an issue that can be addressed 
via a few initiatives, including:

1) better up-front communication from the Office of the Chair through the 
direct supervisors (like we did for United Way last year)
2) entertainment/big-name draw added to the line-up
3) IP-TV as a back-up for those who cannot attend
4) select a better time than last year's meeting (i.e., morning meetings have 
been better attended in the past vs. last year's afternoon meeting)

There are no doubt other small changes we can make to enhance attendance, but 
this should get us headed in the right direction.  Dorie and I would be happy 
to sit down and discuss this with you.

Regardless of what we do to increase attendance, if we wish to do such a 
meeting, we need to pick a date and get on the Hyatt calendar soon.  Their 
calendar is filling up quickly.  Thanks.

Eric

Dave and John --

In the past, ENA has held an all-employee business meeting over at the Hyatt 
in April or May.  Do you plan to hold such a meeting?  If so, we need to get 
started on planning the event.  Dorie Hitchcock has typically handled the 
arrangements.  Please advise.

Dave, Marty,

In general moving the deal to just a Selkirk deal minimizes a lot of the 
concerns surrounding centralized decision making etc.  The plant manager is 
on board   
as is Doron Grossman.  As a result the sales part should be largely completed 
but the deal is far from closed.  I believe driving to closure with margin 
with GE in 2000 will be a challenge.  I haved attached some information 
regarding Marte's other questions and would be happy to discuss with the team.

Hi David,
I'll give you a response with the hope of seeing more information that would 
change my mind.  If you are asking for my opinon, it is difficult to be 
supportive of moving ahead on a transaction like this give the fairly 
significant obstacles (these are usually deals killers) that Rodney 
describes.  What I couldn't read into Rodney's write up were other 
undocumented factors that you might change the probability, like: 

Is there an Sr. executive champion that is willing to "influence" the GE 
negotiating team into getting a deal done, even if the terms are less 
desirable than what Rodney laid out as their requirements?
Are the willing to extned the term so that there isn't a capital tail?
Is there any real compelling motivation for this GE Plastics team to change 
from current practice?  Do we know what that is and what the deadline for 
action for change is? 
Could Rodney suggest alternatives to address the obstacles and show the 
potential impact on the margin in the deal?  
Is there some other component of this deal that is so compelling to the 
prospect that we can attach these pieces to that?

Realistically, based on what is written, the deal you are describing sounds 
like it would have a low probability to close, surely in 2000.  
HOWEVER< if there exenuating circumstances like you feel like we just need to 
win this at all costs, there are values not being calculated that the client 
would recognize, there are senior execs at GE Plastics behind this looking 
for a way to close this, or anything else that is convincing your origination 
team that they have a winner here....then, lets find out what that is and go 
for it.

I wasn't exactly sure what you were asking for.  If it was my opinion, that 
is above.  If it was to put more resource on it to try to make the 
probability go up, I'll be glad to help.  If it is some other, just let me 
know.  

I would suggest we just start with trying to get more information from Rodney 
and team regarding why they are convinced this can be contracted for with 
margin in 2000.  I would love to participate and do what we can to make this 
work out, as long as we all agree that there are reasonable approaches to 
raising the probability of victory.  

Thanks

Guys, I would like your opinion on this potential transaction.  This has been 
sold through GE for some time and it is reasonably likely that if we employed 
some additional resources that this could be completed over the next quarter 
or so.

Ultimately, Rodney and his team would like to see EES take control of the 
deal with EIM folks staying involved to ensure continuity and to assist to 
closure. Assuming that the sales process is largely completed, I see some 
value for Enron to take this deal including:
 a) $200 M in TCV for 2000;
 b) $3 to $5 M in value;
 c) GE on our EES resume of companies which will help in future sales to the 
large industrial customers;
 and d) provides an "in" to the GE family of companies which could result in 
significant up-sell capability in the future if we provide a quality product.

Dave,

The GE Plastics facility is located in Selkirk NY just south of Albany and 
produces polystyrene and polyphenyleneoxide.  The deal value is roughly $4-5 
million NPV of which $3-4 million may be markable income.  

The obstacles to closure are:
- the projected savings have gone from 27% to 20% when GE said they wanted 
more
- there is some capital recovery at the end of year ten that GE would have to 
pay us and they are not yet agreeable to,
- the savings include $1 million in O&M savings and it will be very difficult 
to get to closure with them letting us do the O&M

Deal Stats Are:

Electricity  230,000 mwh/yr  $12 million/yr
Steam  430,000 lbs/yr  $3   million/yr
Gas  470,000 mmbtu/yr $2   million/yr
O&M     $3   million/yr
Total     $20 million/yr

10 year contract, total contract value $200 million.

Let me know if you need any further information.
Thanks,
Rodney

Reading all of the media reports on the $58 million of payments .  All of the reports I have read refer to "executives" receiving payments. I think we need to be very clear that NO executives received payments (at least this is how I understand it).  I am refering to executives as 16b officers.  This will not only clarify the situation for the media, but will help with severed employees as well.

Eric, like the United Way, our goal should be 100%participation.  In order to 
reach that goal, we need the reporting mechanisms to determine which groups 
and managers have very low participation rates.

I strongly believe that ENA's numbers would be better if we had north of 80% 
participation (ie) the "unhappy" folks are more likely to input info than the 
"happy" folks.

Subject: "The Pulse" Employee Survey

"The Pulse" is the new name for the employee survey -- formerly known as 
Excellence Through Communication.  It is scheduled to rollout on Monday, 
October 16.  In an effort to boost participation, I would like to ask for 
your assistance in spreading the word to your direct reports at your staff 
meeting.  They should, in turn, encourage their direct reports to 
participate.  Last year, ENA's participation rate was approximately 50% and 
our goal for this year is 60%.

The survey will take approximately 10 to 15 minutes to complete and can be 
done electronically.  The topics covered are:

 1) What are the obstacles to performance and effectiveness?
 2) What things hinder job satisfaction and fulfillment?
 3) What more can be done to make Enron the best place to work?

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call me at ext. 3-9053.  
Thanks.

I have a major problem with Ben Glisan being deleted, especially without a chance to comment.  I believe he is as critical to the organization as all of the "tier two" members (and has had a larger p/l contribution).  If you disagree, I need to know so I can appropriately set his expectations.  I look at this list and I cannot discern the standard for inclusion.  This standard must be clear and will be closely watched by all employees.

The Raptor I credit capacity is at $94 million.  The credit capacity will be 
impacted by fourth quarter revaluations on Catalytica, Heartland Steel and 
other assets.  If the credit capacity is exceeded, Enron will need to reserve 
for the loss and any future losses.

The TNPC stock closed at $9.38 on November 20.  The closing price on November 
21 is $8.94 which results Raptor III exceeding its credit capacity by $12 
million.

Dave: Do you think your and Lavo's schedules would permit your coming to one 
of my Staff Meetings.  We typically meet on Thursday's at 5pm, but could 
easily modify.  I have an "eclectic" Group of around 35 that would enjoy the 
opportunity to hear from you guys for a half hour or so with a couple of Q&As.

Let me know.  Thanks.

Jordan

PS- Morris and I were in Calgary last week to discuss our Tax position and 
mitigation strategies, Slugger acquisition (I am not confident that we will 
see any benefits this year if we complete this deal.  As Rob may have told 
you, it is moving real slow), transfer pricing, etc.  I think things went 
really well and I would be happy to provide you with more detail, if needed.

Jim,  what ever you think is appropriate.  As far as the weekend, lets just 
play it by ear.

At the meetings, I think it would be helpful to go through the following 
discussions/agenda:
 a) review the Brazilian and Argentine gas and power markets - flows, grid, 
participants (bids and offers), assets, pool structures, regulatory and 
political environment, currency and credit challenges, supply and demand & 
historical prices and volumes;
 b) review ESA's current regulated/un-regulated assets and generation 
strategy;
 c) review ESA current book positions, market views, products and product 
development;
 and d) brief review of other S. American markets.

I assume that you will have the Argentines to Brazil for the discussion and 
any one else you think appropriate.

Let me know what I need to do otherwise.

Thanks

also suggest the Cesar Park in Rio, better location, although Copacabana 
Palace is more famous and classy hotel.  Trip from Rio to Sao Paulo is like 
from Houston to Dallas, inconsequential, spend the first night in Sao Paulo, 
hotel next to the office, and second night in Rio, travel to Rio on Friday 
morning.  Dave, call to discuss or I'll call you, including what would you

As you are undoubtedly more familiar with these firms, you may, or may not, 
think these companies work for the product (we have not tested the 
assumption) but can offer some joint marketing support.  Many of these firms 
have sites accross the continent and it is important to portfolio effect 
their assets to make the transaction work.  We have done  dozens of 
presentations and would propose we put our heads together to determine if 
there is a business opportunity in your market.  

Let me know what you think of the list and which approach makes most sense 
for you.  Jim

PS, via separate e-mail I will forward examples of the presentations we have 
used.

You had asked for clarification regarding the status of our SADAF bid and how 
the 501D turbine that Delaney wants may impact us.

Our bid, along with bids from others, are still under evaluation by SADAF.  
We expect to learn about SADAF's decision through informal channels within 
two weeks, but a formal announcement from SADAF will probably not be 
forthcoming for another month or so. If we win the bid, we enter into PPA 
negotiations that could take about six months to finish.  Until the PPA is 
signed, we wouldn't know for certain that we had clinched the deal.

We were aware of Delaney's possible need for the turbine when we bid SADAF, 
and thus we structured our bid in a manner that provides that we can proceed 
with or without this specific turbine.  

Ownership of this turbine would marginally strengthen our prospects.  
However, I don't want to obstruct another Enron  affiliate if there is a 
bonafide use for the turbine that adds to the Enron bottom line.

If Delaney has a firm "bird in the hand" he should take the turbine.  
Conversely, if our deal firms up before Delaney has a firm use, I would want 
to take the turbine.

My guess is that Delaney's deal will firm up before SADAF.

Rick

Subject: INVESTIGATION OF CORRUPTION IN THE TURKISH ENERGY SECTOR - PRIVATE & 
CONFIDENTIAL


	


Eric Shaw's team has learned that an investigation has been initiated by the 
Turkish military to expose and eliminate corruption in the Turkish energy 
sector.

On January 6, the military took seven energy sector bureaucrats into custody. 
In the following days, other officials from TEA? (the electricity generation 
monopoly) and the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources (MENR) and 
executives from a number of Turkish companies were also taken into custody. 

While many of the bureaucrats and executives have been released, a leaked 
report from the military investigators suggests that the operation is wide 
ranging and may ultimately target the Minister of Energy and Natural 
Resources and other senior energy sector bureaucrats and businessmen. 

Enron Implications

Trakya - One Turkish newspaper has reported that Enron,s  478 MW Trakya power 
project was being investigated.  This has not been reported anywhere else.  
Because the power price at Trakya has been the target of criticism in the 
past, we are not surprised by this report. Although an investigation is 
always a possibility, other than the one newspaper report, there has been no 
indication, official or otherwise, that an investigation is planned or 
underway.
 
GAMA - It has also been reported that the wife of Gorkhan Yardim, the General 
Manager of BOTA? (the natural gas monopoly), works at GAMA, our Turkish 
partner in the Trakya project, and that his expensive car was a gift from 
GAMA. GAMA has told us, and Yardim has defended himself publicly by saying, 
that his wife has been working at GAMA since 1993, long before Yardim had 
risen to his current position of power at BOTA?, and that the car was not a 
gift from GAMA. It is worth noting, however, that there have been a number of 
newspaper reports questioning GAMA,s role in a controversial gas marketing 
deal being undertaken by their TurRusGas joint venture with Gazprom and BOTA?.

Outlook

It is still not clear how or when this investigation will end. In the medium 
and long term, this will be good news for Enron and other reputable Turkish 
or foreign companies which have found it difficult to do transparent energy 
deals in Turkey in the past. In the short term, however, it is likely to 
result in a marked decrease in meaningful activity in the Turkish energy 
sector, as worried bureaucrats, innocent and guilty, lay low. 

We will continue to monitor developments, especially with regard to the 
Trakya project, and report as necessary.

Jere, I understand your frustruation and I am very motived to prove out the 
insurance product; however, I do think John has a legitimate concern 
(especially given the fact that this group blew up very publically internally 
and externally and we need to repair the image internally and market 
perception externally in order to be successful in the future) surrounding 
multiple groups covering the same customers with different stories.  You guys 
could not work this out - so I offered a compromise position which involved a 
well coordinated test marketing iniative (this was agreed to by you and John 
at the offsite):
 a) the insurance group was to identify the initial 5 to 10 target customer 
list that ENA would pitch the product to which should give us a determination 
if this is a commercially viable product;
 b) John and Scott would facilitate the contact with the customers to ensure 
a consistent face and story with the customers - if you guys can sit down and 
come up with an alternative that works for you - great; regardless, John had 
promised me that he would do everything necessary to facilitate and promote 
this capability to these customers ASAP;
 c) both groups would put a deal team together and get out there ASAP;
 d) if the test marketing of the product is successful; I agree that we need 
to sit down and discuss how we formally allign the interests of these groups.

This appears to be a reasonable and logical approach on an interim basis.

We are heading down the road of a gate keeper approach which has proven very 
inefficient at Enron in the past.    Our group has already canceled a meeting 
with the CFO of Vintage because of this approach.  Rerarding  industry 
relationships, George Carrick, Mark Tawney and I have extensive relationships 
throughout the upstream sector, know the decision makers and can set up our 
own meetings, all in coordination with the upstream group.  At this time I am 
waiting on John's group to set up our meetings.  Seems very inefficient.

The main objective is to determine if there is demand for the product.  I 
will continue to coordinate through John but we need to meet to clarify roles 
and responsibilities of all parties - how will deals be structured, who will 
price, who will negotiate transaction, etc.

We currently have $21.4 million in reserve for potential Northwest refunds.  $10 million currently sits in the LTCA book and $11.4 currently sits in the LTNW book.  During the summer, FERC initiated an investigation into the potential of unjust and unreasonable spot prices in the northwest from December of 2000 through June of 2001.  Seatlle City Light, Tacoma City Light, Eugene Water and Electric Board, and Sacramento Municipal Utility District all filed claims at FERC for refunds from EPMI.  The claims totaled close to $100 million.  However, many of these claims were, on their face, spurious.  For example, Eugene Water and Electric Board filed for refund of forward purchases which was clearly outside the scope of FERC's proceeding.

We hired consultants from Charles River Associates (CRA) to help us with this process.  One of their tasks was to apply the CAISO competitive benchmark pricing methodology to the Northwest market.  That is, CRA attempted to reverse engineer the CAISO's methodology in order to estimate our Northwest risk.

I was informed by our litigation team that EPMI's realistic potential exposure using this methodology was roughly $30 million.  We decided to reserve roughly 2/3 of this amount which came to about $21 million.

In September a FERC Adminitrative Law Judge heard the case and submitted a draft decision to the FERC.  The draft decision recommended against any refunds.  This draft decision is supposed to come in front of the FERC commissioners for approval before the end of the year.  If this draft decision is approved, it would be appropriate to remove these reserves.

Subject: Re: Sysco  

Richard, I have forwarded to you a copy of the Sysco California contract 
marked to show comments  made by ENA. Although ENA was very responsive, I did 
not find their comments substantive but rather style/preference oriented. 
Given that this was the first time they had seen this document, I was 
somewhat surprised. Jim Keller (who worked with Debbie) and Debbie reviewed  
them and took some of their suggestions and ignored others. I don't  think 
ENA completely understands the retail business as some of their comments were 
more wholesale oriented. Debbie can give you her view as well as information 
on the "process" the two legal departments used to work through the document. 
I do not know what  conversations Don Black had with ENA legal. 

I think what frustrated Hector and me so much was the number of people who 
had to review the contract, make suggestions, the suggestions had to be 
incorporated into the document (which, remember, Sysco had already seen 
once), then re-reviewed by the person making the suggestion. I realize that 
we are breaking new ground and that it is a California contract but there 
needs to be a better, less time consuming and smoother way. 

I have listed below most of the people who reviewed the contract (to the best 
of my memory). Several of these individuals were difficult to corner as this 
was not really their responsibility but given the state (California), were 
asked to do so. 


Debbie Asmus - lead attorney
Mike Smith - commodity
Jim Kellar - commodity

Over the past few months, Enron Global Finance has been evaluating various opportunities where Enron and Smith Graham & Company may be able to work together.  Unfortunately, the process was slowed when our primary contact at Smith Graham, Gabriel Hayes, left the firm earlier this year.  We have since reestablished discussions and the Global Finance Group is preparing a proposal that a portion (about $30 million) of the Enron Cash Balance Plan portfolio be dedicated to an emerging managers portfolio.  One-third of this money ($10 million) would be invested in bonds, which could be placed with Smith Graham, as the fixed-income manager .  (Total Plan assets are about $235 million.)

The proposal will be submitted to the Plan Administrative Committee at its quarterly meeting on May 3rd.  The proposal should be well received as the Committiee has previously requested that  we optimize our existing allocation to minority money managers.  Gerald Smith has been advised that Enron is looking at ways to allocate money to the firm, and that a decision should be reached sometime in May.  We have not communicated the specific details of our intentions as of yet pending the outcome of the May 3rd meeting.

I am available for further discussion at your convenience.

Subject: OK, Jeff, you requested that we be candid about Enron...

"Management does things right; Leadership does the right things." (Peter 
Drucker)

Today I began to wonder if I've been a fool in staunchly defending Enron's 
Visions & Values. 

An esteemed colleague of very strong professional reputation at Enron was 
recently approached by a hiring supervisor.  Totally unexpected & 
unsolicited, an offer was accepted; all seemed well as this Recruit got good 
feedback directly from clients & Enron upper mgmt.  But after a short time, 
suddenly Recruit was told that performance was unsatisfactory.  No specific 
behaviors or problems were identified as cause; no opportunity given to 
modify; Recruit was summarily removed to another floor with instructions to 
find another job.  Upon displacement she told me (~6 weeks ago), "I want 
avoid trouble for anyone; I just want to continue quietly at Enron and forget 
this."  

To date I have honored her request for silence, but all this hullabaloo about 
Enron being the best place to work makes her dilemma particularly upsetting, 
and there is ample evidence that her plight is not unique.  I refer here to 
Cindy Adams, formerly of Joe Sutton's office.  I don't care why it was 
decided not to use HR's counseling/review process designed to help when 
things go awry; I just know that Enron's best bet is to give this talented 
professional more time.  She writes:

...Last week, my HR Rep informed me that I have a deadline of July 15th in 
which to find a job...I have no assistance from HR or Recruiting.  I had 2 
interviews 5 weeks ago and I had to initiate those myself.  I've not received 
answers from postings I've responded to - I am left hanging without 
acknowledgment of any sort.

I have been approached and learned from others that the same thing happened 
to them with the same circumstances; one said that it took her a full 3 
months to land her present job.  I am not afforded that opportunity now ...

Jeff, would you please ask someone to remove Cindy's July 15 deadline?  There 
are no rules left to break here; Cindy is trying to proceed diligently & 
discreetly, but she is under duress by not having any feedback/support from 
HR.   With a little boost, it's not too late to bring this picture into line 
with Enron's vision of retaining topnotch people.  

Cindy has no idea that I'm writing on her behalf, and after this I intend to 
honor her wishes with silence.  But you must see the irony here, not to 
mention the double standard in how Enron's Visions & Values are applied to 
assistants all over Enron:  Cindy Adams was sought after, then abruptly put 
out of the office of Joe Sutton, who happens to be our V&V expert!  I'm not 
blaming Joe for anything; he is simply the backdrop in this example.  I 
remember Joe once used an expression at a floor meeting:  "believing your own 
baloney."  He wasn't talking about Visions & Values then, but "believing 
baloney" suddenly seems to fit for assistants who work at Enron.  You asked 
for candid; herein I have done my very best to give it to you.

Jeff, thanks for asking and listening.  I and my colleagues are listening 
too, but seeing is believing.

Respectfully submitted,

I am pleased to announce that yesterday (May 3) we closed the sale of the

this LONG transaction was truly a team effort!  We are currently planning a 
closing celebration, and I will follow up with the details.

Thanks again for everyone's contribution.

yesterday)

This NY cap proposal must be prevented.   The proposal is essentially 
cost-based regulation.   Obviously, if the proposal below was adopted by NY, 
Enron's ability to make money is greatly diminished.   In addition, it has 
significant effects on the rest of the market in terms of regulatory 
uncertainty in the forward markets.

In the past, FERC has ruled to make caps consistent in all 3 NE regions (NY, 
NE, and PJM), which leads to quasi caps in the rest of the Eastern 
Interconnect.

Jim,
We need an action plan ASAP.   Please coordinate with Dana, Tom May, and 
myself.

FYI.  In the interest of all the developing markets, I think that we need to 
make a full court press to ensure that this does not get enough support to 
pass at the committee level in New York.  I will arrange a meeting with 
regulatory to plan our response.

Subject: NYPSC Interim Pricing Report on ISO

Earlier today, the New York Public Service Commission released a 122 page 
draft report prepared by its staff evaluating the NYISO. The report concludes 
that the ISO must pursue a wide range of operational reforms and other 
consumer safeguards to "ensure a more efficient and stable electric market 
that will better protect consumers from dramatic price increases." The report 
culminates a months-long investigation begun by the PSC last summer in 
response to problems and price run-ups in the wholesale market.

The major recommendations in the Report, some of which have already surfaced 
in recent ISO Committee meetings, would be devastating to a competitive 
wholesale market and would largely reregulate prices in New York. They 
include the following (taken directly from the PSC's Press Release):

Reforming rules and procedures to improve the efficiency of the market and 
minimize opportunities for market manipulation, or "gaming," by owners of 
electricity generating facilities;
Initiating a $150 per megawatt hour price cap on generators to maintain 
reasonable market clearing prices;
Creating a "circuit-breaker" mechanism that will prevent market power abuses 
at levels below $150/MWH;
Lowering price thresholds significantly to allow the NYISO to step in more 
quickly to investigate and mitigate price spikes;
Granting the NYISO retroactive refund authority to return to consumers gains 
that generators improperly derive from market power abuse; and,
Creating a strong deterrent against price abuses by penalizing generators who 
repeatedly use improper tactics to raise prices above competitive levels.

The NYPSC, of course, has no legal authority to impose any of these 
recommendations. However, they are likely to muster support from the 
Transmission Owners, governmental entities and loads, that usually control 
enough votes to just  pass a motion at an ISO Committee. This will set up a 
confrontation with the ISO Board, which is walking a delicate tightrope 
between maintaining its independence and supporting a competitive wholesale 
market on the one hand, and dealing with the politics of a hostile 
Administration in New York. Last summer, as you may recall, the Board 
rejected the $1000 bid cap pushed through by the PSC, voting instead for a 
$1300 cap. That action was set aside by FERC, which reimposed the $1,000 
level and then made it applicable in New England as well so that there would 
be consistency among the three Northeast ISOs (PJM already had the $1,000 
cap.) 

Thus, whether NY follows the lead of California is likely to be determined by 
FERC, and it will have to carefully consider the consistency concerns it 
raised last summer in ultimately deciding whether it's OK for New York to set 
price caps below its neighboring ISOs.

Attached is a copy of the PSC's Press Release and Report.

I just heard that Chris Gaffney is transferring to the Toronto office. His 
skill sets/capabilities have been critical in the closing of both the UI and 
NSTAR deals and he has been actively engaged in the long-term NSTAR deal, 
Con-Ed, and our Project Green Jacket. It is critical to our business to have 
no transitional period with attorneys and I expect his replacement to be 
fully up to speed (i.e. knowledge of the power market, understanding of 
structured power transactions, etc) relative to definitive documents around 
these transactions. Chris is definitely a loss to our team. Please advise as 
to his qualified replacement on these specific deals.  Thanks.

Subject: Organizational Changes

On November 8, the Office of the Chairman, issued an important communication, 
announcing significant organizational changes in Enron's worldwide 
operations. The purpose of this memo is to share with you the decisions that 
are underway to restructure  Enron,s operations in South America.  The basic 
organizational framework has been set. 

As you know, Diomedes Christodoulou and Jim Bannantine will be assuming new 
responsibilities within Enron. Replacing them will be Orlando Gonzalez and 
Joe Kishkill, who will become the Co-Presidents of South America, reporting 
to Dave Delainey and John Lavorato.  They will share overall responsibility; 
however, Orlando,s focus will be on direct sales origination, 
commercial/government relationships and regulatory issues.  Joe,s focus will 
be on wholesale origination, financial and operating performance and overall 
country management.  In addition, Orlando will continue as President and CEO 
of Elektro until its ultimate sale.

The existing, large integrated asset base in South America (excluding 
Elektro) will be managed and operated by Rebecca McDonald and Jim Hughes in 
Enron Global Assets, which is part of Enron Wholesale Services under Mark 
Frevert. Ultimately, there will be very close coordination in both Brazil and 
Argentina between Enron Americas and Enron Global Assets to ensure that our 
reputation in South America is protected, our asset positions are being 
managed prudently and that commercial opportunities surrounding these assets 
are pursued.

The remaining natural gas and electrical commercial activities in South 
America will be organized around the highly successful North American network 
business model.  This model employs people, market making, physical 
commodities, capital and assets to provide reliable, flexible and high-value 
products to our customers.  It is people and intellectual capital based and 
enjoys high rates of return on invested capital.

In the interest of pursuing this strategy, the following teams will report to 
Joe and Orlando:
 
The Commercial Origination team will be lead by Brett Wiggs.  The team will  
focus on covering South American markets, primarily Brazilian and Argentine 
natural gas and electricity, with the following goals:

? Generating new, innovative, reliable and high value products and services 
needed by the market by utilizing our commodity, asset and capital 
capabilities;
? Providing those products and services across South America and across the 
value chain, including wholesale and retail, based upon the highest value 
opportunity;
? Finding structural value arbitrages in the South American market and move 
quickly to capitalize;
? Assisting the Risk Management and Trading organization in managing the 
overall risk of the organization;
? Managing all new power and asset development opportunities in South America 
consistent with this strategy, and
? Providing the Risk Management and Trading organization information and deal 
flow.

The Commercial Origination team will consist of a diverse group of people who 
work as a single team which bring the required skills including commodity, 
capital, regulatory, asset, development, market, structuring, deal execution, 
finance and country knowledge necessary to reach our goals. 

The Trading and Risk Management team will be headed by Remi Collonges.  The 
team will continue to develop pricing information and manage the price book 
for the relevant energy markets in support of the wholesale and direct sales 
efforts.  Additionally, the team will work toward implementation of actively 
trading South American energy commodities.  This group will be responsible 
for managing Enron South America,s overall risk and will have a direct 
reporting relationship with John Lavorato in his role as head of the Americas 
risk activities.

The Argentine effort will be integrated into the overall South American 
Commercial Origination and Trading and Risk Management groups; however, we 
will continue to maintain an Argentine office headed by Michael Guerriero.  

The goal of the reorganization is to create a flat team oriented organization 
that is very market and commercially focused.  The following support 
functions will assist the overall business objectives of the commercial team 
and will report into Joe and Orlando, plus into their line functions in 
Houston.  The overall goal is to ensure that the South American business 
units have an adequate support organization to evaluate opportunities, as 
well as manage day-to-day business and risk.  Otherwise, the Houston 
infrastructure will provide resources as needed to manage peak requirements 
in South America, not unlike other businesses in Enron Americas.

These groups include:

The Government Affairs team, which will be headed by Sergio Assad, will 
manage the relationships with the relevant regulatory agencies as well as 
governmental ministries.  The primary regulatory goal will be to facilitate, 
in the near term, substantive changes to the regulatory rules to allow a 
functioning wholesale traded market in Brazil and Argentina. Sergio will 
assume his responsibilities upon completion of the Elektro sale.  During this 
interim period, Jose Bestard will continue to be in charge of the regulatory 
function.  Once Sergio makes the transition, he will also report to Rick 
Shapiro in Enron Government Affairs.

The Finance team will be headed by Britaldo Soares.  The team will manage the 
interface with Enron Global Finance.  Britaldo will transition from his 
current duties at Elektro upon completion of the Elektro sale.  Britaldo will 
also report to Joe Deffner in Enron Global Finance.  Rob Gay will be 
assisting Britaldo during the transition, while continuing his work on the 
Cuiaba project.

The Legal team, which will be lead by Randy Young, as general counsel, and 
John Novak, as deputy general counsel, will manage South America,s legal 
requirements.  Randy and John will also report to Mark Haedicke in Enron 
Wholesale Services - Legal Department.

Miguel Padron will become Chief of Staff.  Human Resources, Information 
Technology, Treasury, Accounting & Reporting, as well as Administration will 
report to Miguel.  This will bring focus to essential, but non-commercial 
functions, as well as more efficiently manage key matrix reporting 
relationships with Enron.  Miguel will also report to David Oxley in Enron 
Wholesale Services ) Human Resources and Wes Colwell in Enron Wholesale 
Services ) Business Analysis and Reporting.

These changes are consistent with Enron's evolving business strategy and 
reflect our continuing commitment to grow the company by maximizing our 
financial and intellectual capital.  However, in line with the new 
organizational structure and the near term potential for business in the 
region, further budget reductions will be necessary.  People directly 
affected will be notified shortly.
 
Enron is committed to continue the successful implementation of its 
businesses in South America.  We believe that as the markets develop, we are 
uniquely positioned to leverage Enron,s core capabilities and create 
shareholder value.

We have been working closely with the Trade Promotion outreach effort the White House established, and have regularly attended whip meetings with White House staff and others.  In that role, we are "working" a number of Texas Democrats.  I will talk again with the Congresswoman, and will call on Steve Kean to work her if needed.

Ken, I am writing to ask Enron's assistance with a pro-Trade Promotion
Authority message to Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee.

The position of the Partnership and Enron are well known to Sheila.  She
consistently has voiced doubts about her ability to vote for trade
issues such as China PNTR and fast track/TPA, but in the end joins her
pro-business and trade colleagues in supporting these measures. You have
always been a very effective lobbyist on this issue.

Most recently, on October 10, 2001, Rep. Lee told Rep. Norman Dicks
(D-WA) (he was the first D to be a supporter of this new compromise leg
(HR 3005) and is whipping the issue for the Ds) that she is a no vote on
TPA (HR 3005).

Rep. Lee's reasons for not supporting this issue are as follows:

1. The process has been too partisan, Ds like Rep. Charles Rangel were
not consulted and brought to the table to develop compromise language in
the beginning.

2. Since only 25 - 30 Ds will be voting for this (and we need her to be
one of those) she will feel alone as a D.

ACTION REQUESTED:  Ken, could you or someone senior at Enron place a
call to Rep. Jackson Lee to voice strong support for TPA?

An appropriate message is that we want her to focus on good public
policy.  We are not defending the process.  This is about good
economics.  TPA benefits her consituents.

We have attached a study that highlights the benefits of trade in her
district.  This may be useful information.  It has employment numbers
and more.

The TPA vote could come next week, as early as Tuesday.  A call to her
here in Houston at 713-655-0050 would be appropriate, as the House is
recessed until Tuesday.

Thanks in advance for your positive response to this request.

I am sorry that I was unable to meet with you yesterday on Cuiba.  Jim has 
told me what the two of you decided and it is fine with me.  Below is a note 
that I received this morning from Pete.  The meeting he is referencing is an 
indepth update on the project that I requested a week ago.  You are more than 
welcome to attend if you would like to - just let me know.

I am not sure that Pete is the right guy to work this or not, but I do agree 
that we need to introduce someone else into the process - I am thinking 
either Chris Hunt or Mariella Mahan.  I would be happy to discuss with you 
why I recommend one of those two individuals.

Subject: Cuiaba I Team

the list below is going to Delainey - it is accurate from my perspective - if 
the project ends up in your shop for completion and fixing up - and if it 
ends up under me - some of these part time guys should become full time and 
some of the full time guys should take a back seat.

I would have the full time dedicated team be - 

Jose Bestard (he currently is chief of regulatory for South America) - he 
negotiated the original PPA and has indepth knowledge of how the regulatory 
system does and does not work.

Joao Carlos Alberquerque - top notch Brazilian power expert - has the right 
contacts and relationships and can get us through the maze of Brazilian 
resistance.  Currently he is headed for wholesale merchant.

John Novak - best legal mind - needs to curb the use of outside lawyers a bit 
- has been on the project continuous from day one - and needs to be 
rejuvenated a bit - but has thourough understanding of how bthe entire 
project is wired together.

Rob Gay - Finance 

Laine Powell - is currently President of the oeprating companies - Cuiaba is 
producing 300 mw of power which is being sold and paid for.

Felipe Ospina - modeler - I don't know this guy -  he is relatively new to 
the project and seems satisfactory

Would recommend also a fresh set of eyes on the project - not front line 
negotiator - but someone good at structuring - or work outs - to review 
overall project structure objectively and challange conventional wisdom. 

Other folks on the list below can support the dedicated team - part time.

Would tell these guys - this is your only job - and here is your starting 
point - new deal.  Your job is not just to close financing - it is to get 
Enron's money out or otherwise improve the returns of the project.    You 
will get paid based on this point forward.   It will take at least 9 months 
to implement a solution that improves our returns or gest more than just 
financial close achieved.

This leaves some sticky situations - Rick Lammers has absolutely busted his 
ass getting things done and moving the project forward - he has been lead 
developer - but has had lots of "help" from Bannantine and the entire team.   
Help tended to obscure responsibility and accountability.  I am not sure 
anyone could have gotten this thing done by now - but certainly there were 
some things that could have been done better - in 20/20 hindsight  - and some 
things that can be done better now.  The things that come be done better now 
- I am pushing into Laines's area of responsibility this week.  People need 
to get rededicated and fired back up - I also think it is kind of difficult 
to "take over" the project without making some changes in the way it is being 
run.   

For the review on Monday - I have asked the following people to present -

Rick Lammers
Laine Powell
Jose Bestard

Also in attendance will be John Novak, Joe Kishkill, Brett Wiggs, Rob Gay and 
myself.

The guys asked if Jim Bannantine should be present - I said no - let me know 
if you would like him there.

You should see - a brief description of the overall project (not the strategy 
- just how it is wired together- where the money is intended to be be) and 
then straight to a listing of all things that need to get done to "finish" 
the project to the point where we have financial close and a functioning 
supply and PPA.

Joe and I and Rob will be in Houston and the rest of the team will dial in a 
conference call. 

Let me know if the above format is ok.

Jere, I understand your frustruation and I am very motived to prove out the 
insurance product; however, I do think John has a legitimate concern 
(especially given the fact that this group blew up very publically internally 
and externally and we need to repair the image internally and market 
perception externally in order to be successful in the future) surrounding 
multiple groups covering the same customers with different stories.  You guys 
could not work this out - so I offered a compromise position which involved a 
well coordinated test marketing iniative (this was agreed to by you and John 
at the offsite):
 a) the insurance group was to identify the initial 5 to 10 target customer 
list that ENA would pitch the product to which should give us a determination 
if this is a commercially viable product;
 b) John and Scott would facilitate the contact with the customers to ensure 
a consistent face and story with the customers - if you guys can sit down and 
come up with an alternative that works for you - great; regardless, John had 
promised me that he would do everything necessary to facilitate and promote 
this capability to these customers ASAP;
 c) both groups would put a deal team together and get out there ASAP;
 d) if the test marketing of the product is successful; I agree that we need 
to sit down and discuss how we formally allign the interests of these groups.

This appears to be a reasonable and logical approach on an interim basis.

We are heading down the road of a gate keeper approach which has proven very 
inefficient at Enron in the past.    Our group has already canceled a meeting 
with the CFO of Vintage because of this approach.  Rerarding  industry 
relationships, George Carrick, Mark Tawney and I have extensive relationships 
throughout the upstream sector, know the decision makers and can set up our 
own meetings, all in coordination with the upstream group.  At this time I am 
waiting on John's group to set up our meetings.  Seems very inefficient.

The main objective is to determine if there is demand for the product.  I 
will continue to coordinate through John but we need to meet to clarify roles 
and responsibilities of all parties - how will deals be structured, who will 
price, who will negotiate transaction, etc.

Guys, Swank has confirmed with me that he is committed to join the mid-market 
group in east power and make a difference.  I would strongly support his 
movement into either SERC or ECAR as per our earlier discussion.  

I hope to be moving several experienced dealmakers into the gas and power 
mid-market groups to increase our deal-making skills and relationships in 
those markets.  I would also hope to move a reasonable number of new 
associates (that only rotate within trading and mid-market) to the various 
desks.  The goal is  to increase the bench strength of the trading and 
mid-market groups plus support John's iniatives on the fundamental groups.

As everyone is surely aware after last night's going away party, John Forney 
is heading back to Houston to trade the Short Term Entergy market.  Bill 
Williams III will be assuming responsibility for the Real Time desk and will 
report to Greg Wolfe.  There are three major areas of responsibility that 
Greg and Bill will be focussing on in 2001.  The first is the management of 
EPMI's physical power flows.  This entails checking out with counterparties, 
handling cuts, and ensuring that all of our risk and settlement systems 
reflect the proper information.  The second area is trading done by the Real 
Time group.  Each day, our Real Time desk combs the market looking for 
attractive trading opportunities.  The third area is the Services Desk.  The 
Services Desk provides scheduling and settlements services to customers who 
don't have the staff or systems to do it themselves.  We have seen our 
Services business grow dramatically this year.

Greg Wolfe will be ultimately responsible for the efforts of the Real Time 
desk and our Services business.  Les Rawson will continue in his role on the 
Services desk and will report to Greg.  Bill Williams will be responsible for 
the day to day operations of the Real Time desk.  Greg will continue to work 
closely with the middle market group and will maintain some of his coverage 
responsibilities.  Chris Foster will continue to manage the Middle Market 
group.

Subject: California bankruptcy expenses

I would like some guidance about  outside counsel fees related to the 
California situation.  We ( EES and ENA) retained joint counsel in early 
January. As you may recall, in January a substantial amount of work was done 
with the attempted rescue effort by the US Department of Treasury, and the  
managing down of the trading positions with PG&E's unregulated entity.  

I would say that  EES and ENA have used this counsel relatively equally, and 
it would not be inappropriate to split the bills on a  50/50 basis.  However, 
there are two other issues that we should consider: (a) on an overall basis, 
I would say that ENA will have more  issues  that will come out of the 
bankruptcy, and (b) certainly, they will be easier able to absorb as  a 
company  the increased legal expenses.  

Please let me know whether we should go forward with the 50/50 arrangement or 
whether we should adopt another approach.

One other fact:  We also have joint representation in the class action 
lawsuits filed against the power marketers.  To date, no sharing  has been 
agreed to, based on EES' position that in is improperly named in the lawsuit 
(i.e., it is not a participant in the wholesale markets and did not  benefit 
from the  volatility this summer).

Body:
I think a key point is that the California legislature and CPUC implicitly 
put themselves in the position as "procurement managers" for California 
consumers.  They did this in two  ways:
Forced utilities to go short by selling a minimum of 50% of their thermal 
generation (the utilities chose to sell more and the CPUC approved it).  
Steve Peace and many California politicians claimed that they sold these 
assets at ridiculously high prices.
Required utilities to buy all of their needs (at least at first, then most of 
their needs when the Block Forward Market opened) from the spot market.  They 
explicitly chose to take a huge short position into the spot market every day.

These two basic facts led to a variety of unintended consequences:
Utilities had no incentive, in fact would have to be irrational risk seekers, 
to purchase forward.  All activitiy measured against peak index (same problem 
plagues their gas market).  After the summer of 1999 when utilities made 
modest Block Forward purchases at prices higher than the spot market 
liquidated the CPUC played Monday morning quarterback and threatened prudency 
review.
Huge spot market purchasing requirement causes utilities to take large short 
positions into real time, creating reliability problems.
Lack of forward buying signals dampened the asset developement efforts.  
Developers looked at low spot prices in 1998 and 1999 and invested capital 
elsewhere in the country (e.g., Enron's peaking plants).  Meanwhile 
tremendous demand existed, but was masked by years of strong hydro and a 
summer of mild weather.  In 2000 when the demand showed up, it was too late.  
Had utilities tried to hedge forward, the forward price would have move up 
modestly, causing increased investment in generation.  With reasonable siting 
rules and forward purchasing by the utilities we could have built significant 
generation to meet the 2001 summer season.
Fundamental shortage combined with huge spot market demand caused prices in 
California, and the rest of the west, to increase.

California didn't deregulate, they made a strategic bet to go short!  Once 
they made this strategic bet, they "fired" the traditional portfolio manager 
-- the utilities -- and hired the CalPX spot market to meet all of their 
needs.  They then let the ship sail with nobody at the helm.  Deregulation 
didn't fail; the State of California has simply proven to be a horribly 
irresponsible portfolio manager.

Other versions of a true deregulated market can work.  Protection for small 
consumers can be achieved by establishing a default provider or specifying a 
portfolio approach.  Asset divestitures can work with a contract from the 
buyer guaranteeing supply for a few years (this is what happened in MT which 
is why industrial customers are hurting there and small customers have been 
protected by a 3 year purchase contract).

Ontario Power Generation and Bruce Power announce leasing agreement at Bruce 
Nuclear 

    KINCARDINE, ON, July 11 /CNW-PRN/ - Ontario Power Generation (OPG) today
announced it has entered into a major agreement with Bruce Power Partnership
relating to the facilities at the Bruce nuclear site. Bruce Power is 95% owned
by British Energy plc. The transaction provides an opportunity for the two
main unions, the Power Workers' Union and The Society of Energy Professionals
on the Bruce site, to subscribe to 5% of the equity.
    This public/private partnership involves a long-term lease agreement for
the Bruce A (3076 MW-currently in lay-up), and Bruce B (3140 MW) facilities.
The lease runs until 2018, with an option to extend for up to another 25
years. OPG will receive an initial payment of $625 M to be made in three
installments. A first payment of $400 M will be made on closing subject to
normal closing adjustments. The remaining $225 M will be paid in two
installments of $112.5 M each.
    Bruce Power's annual payments include base and variable elements. The
variable elements include a share of the net revenue, and supplementary
payments for the management of used fuel. In total these payments are
estimated to be about $150 M in calendar year 2002.
    Bruce Power will offer employment to all employees at the Bruce site,
other than those being retained by OPG. Employees remaining with OPG include
those that provide waste management and centralized nuclear operations support
services. The agreement is expected to close, subject to Bruce Power obtaining
the necessary licences, in the summer of 2001.
    "Today's announcement is good news for employees, the community, the
electricity consumer and the shareholder" stated Ron Osborne, OPG President
and CEO. "This agreement injects private equity into the Bruce facilities
which in turn will provide new opportunities for employees and the community.
It is also a major step towards opening the Ontario electricity marketplace to
competition and providing electricity consumers with choice." Osborne noted
that an additional benefit of the agreement allows OPG to concentrate on
accelerating the performance improvements underway at its Darlington and
Pickering nuclear facilities while the new company focuses on the Bruce.
    Nuclear safety continues to be of paramount importance for Ontario Power
Generation, and safety has been a key tenet for British Energy. Both companies
are committed to ensuring high safety performance standards.
    "We are delighted to be announcing the creation of a new company. Bruce
Power will demonstrate that safety and commercial success go hand in hand,"
said Robin Jeffrey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of British Energy
Canada Ltd. "We have a high regard for CANDU technology and for the skill of
the staff at Bruce. We are confident that by working with the staff and the
unions, Bruce Power can achieve world class safety and commercial
performance."
    To reduce its market dominance, OPG is required by conditions in its
operating licence granted by the Ontario Energy Board (OEB), to reduce its
share of generating capacity to no more than 35 per cent of that available to
the province 10 years after the market opens.
    British Energy was selected following an extensive worldwide competitive
process over the last two years. They have significant operating experience
and a proven safety track record with a range of nuclear reactor types.
    To close the transaction, Bruce Power will be required to secure licences
from the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) and the Ontario Energy
Board. Bruce Power will be required to follow the stringent licensing and
operating requirements established by CNSC, formerly the Atomic Energy Control
Board.
    Ontario Power Generation is a major North American electricity generating
company. OPG's principal business is the generation and sale of electricity to
consumers in Ontario and into the interconnected markets. OPG's goal is to be
a premier North American energy company, focused on low-cost power generation
and wholesale energy sales, while operating in a safe, open and
environmentally responsible manner.
    British Energy PLC is the UK's largest electricity generator. British
Energy owns and operates 15 reactors in the UK and a further two in the United
States through its joint venture, AmerGen. British Energy's goal is to be a
worldwide electricity leader building on its "Safety First" culture and track
record of commercial success.

Everyone should have received the e-mail below regarding "The Pulse."  If you 
are like me, you probably ignored it or deleted it.  I'm asking everyone in 
West Power Trading to go into "The Pulse" and fill out the survey.  It is 
easy and takes about 5 minutes.  I just completed it myself in under 5 
minutes.  Here's what you have to do:
click on the link below
fill out the three category selections (1) Enron North America / Enron Global 
Markets / Enron Industrial Markets; (2) Risk Management and Trading;  (3) 
Select Your title.
Fill out the survey -- There were 17 multiple choice questions related to how 
well (or not well) the organization is managed.  The next section provides an 
opportunity to identify barriers that prevent you from doing your job or 
cause you to work longer than you have to;  Finally, it asks for 
recommendations, in 100 words or less.

Please take the time to fill this out.  I found it useful.  It is important 
for us to hear your voice.  Be honest with your feedback.

Thanks for your help!

Once again, it's time to find out what you think about your work experience 
at Enron and what we can do to help make it better.  That's why we want to 
check your pulse.  In fact, we've changed the name of last year's "Excellence 
Through Communication" employee survey to The Pulse.  We believe The Pulse 
more accurately captures the purpose of the survey.  Your diagnosis will help 
us correct problem areas so we can continue to make Enron a great place to 
work.

Is available:  Monday, October 16 ) Friday, Oct. 27
Is located at: survey.enron.com

There are a few things we want you to remember about The Pulse:

1. Your survey responses will be confidential.  You can complete your survey 
at your desktop or at special computer kiosks that are set up in some of our 
larger offices.  Several group computer terminals also will be available in 
smaller field offices.  We want to provide you with the most comfortable 
environment possible, as your participation is of vital importance to us.
2. We will respond actively to your comments.  We are going to do our best to 
cure some of the current problems that exist and put into action preventative 
processes that will help identify smaller problems before they become major 
ones.  We may ask for your help in resolving some of the issues that are 
collected in the survey ) your active role will help us identify the best 
solutions.
In last year's survey, you identified several problem areas regarding 
internal communications and we've already acted on many of your 
recommendations.  These are a few of the things we've accomplished or are 
working on in direct response to your input:
1. Require all executives (VP and above) to attend the Executive Impact & 
Influence course, which is a 360-degree program designed to improve 
leadership and communication skills.  By year-end, more than 90 percent will 
have attended this course, with the remaining 10 percent to be trained in the 
first quarter of 2001.
2. Offer all employees online communication courses.  These courses will be 
available in the first quarter of 2001.
3. Improve our online communication tools, beginning in the fourth quarter, 
2000:
   w Simplify and standardize Enron directories
   w Educate all employees about the availability and usage of IT tools.
   w Promote intelligent/responsible use of email.
4. Introduce Participation & Dissent (P&D) sessions to provide a vehicle for 
solving problems, addressing issues and developing new opportunities.  This 
application will launch in the first quarter of 2001 in the ThinkBank on 
eThink.

So take a few minutes to check your pulse and tell us what you think and how 
you feel about your job and about Enron.

To: David W Delainey/HOU/ECT@ECT

Subject: Fidelity update

Last week during the holidays, we made a lot of progress w/ Fidelity 
regarding their "take-out" from the Partnership at Dallas.  We exchanged 2 
drafts of a Letter Agreement which says ENA (or an affiliate) will buy their 
99% LP interest in Landfill Gas Investments, LP (LGI) on or before Jan 31, 
2001.  Included in our draft was a provision whereby the ENE Guaranty would 
be extinguished.  However, late yesterday Fidelity came back and said they're 
not willing to extinguish the Guaranty completely.  The way the deal w/ 
Fidelity will be structured, ENA will pay them the delta between the $5.2MM 
initial payment they made less the accrued tax credits on the date we close 
(est to be $300K+/-).  Fidelity wants 2 things:

protection in the event the IRS disallows/disqualifies the tax credits 
accrued (i.e., the $300K), and
protection against any environmental claims that may have occurred while they 
were a partner in LGI (June, 200 thru Jan, 2001).

There are 2 basic alternatives to consider:

replace the existing guaranty to LGI with a new guaranty to Fidelity with a 
specific cap on the tax credit amount ($300K+/-) and with the same 
environmental coverage (up to $5MM) as currently exists but restricting it to 
issues which occurred while they were a partner.  The probability of either 
ever being triggered is extremely remote.  Replacing the benefactor from LGI 
to Fidelity is significant for us because it eliminates future environmental 
exposure related to LGI as well as prevents potential future buyers of our LP 
interest from seeing that ENE once was willing to issue such a guaranty.
replace the existing guaranty with an indemnity from ENA which provides 
Fidelity with the same protection as alternative #1.  Per ENA accounting 
since the amount of exposure is limited to $5.3MM in aggregate, this would 
not be significant/material enough to be separately identified as a balance 
sheet item.

The problem we have is Fidelity has a Guaranty "in hand" and unless you give 
me approval to go back and structure our deal around them, we don't have any 
leverage to get them to release it.  They are willing to work with us on 
either of the 2 alternatives listed above.  This is the only remaining 
commercial issue left w/ Fidelity.

Please advise or call to discuss further.  Ext. 33212.  Thanks!

RANDY

Jere, I spoke with Scott on these targets and his belief is that both 
himself, Allen and John have significant relationships with these folks which 
should help leverage your product into this sector. Scott and John have 
agreed to set up these meetings with the decision makers in these targets 
with no delay.  From there, you, John and Scott can determine what deal team 
will go speak to them about the opportunities.  I would expect that we will 
be in front of these folks ASAP.  Lets see how the product is embraced by 
these customers before we extend the target list and create a more formal 
alignment of the groups.  As per your earlier e-mail, I assume you are 
working on the Reeding & Bates opportunity.

it appears that more spots are being filled by Enron people then customers. 
The effectiveness of this forum from a customer point of view is 
questionable.  I vote to kill it.

Dave, 

We will either: 

1. Find an acceptable structure for the LIPA PPA (unit contingent - no 
replacement energy risk) and complete the transaction.   LIPA is aware of our 
issues and is considering how they want to proceed.
2. Don't come to terms on the PPA and sell the barges to LIPA - probably the 
best case scenario.
3. Don't come to terms on the PPA and sell the barges to ConEd, Morgan 
Stanley, AES or NRG (we are now in the process of agreeing CAs with these 
parties with respect to an infor memo on the barges/deal), or
4. Let BargeCo keep the barges (technically they still own them now).

The time frame for resolving this is Q4.

Brian

  d) 1 7EA - Janet/Chris- $20M

All other turbines appear to be allocated to high probability projects.  
Could you please provide me your plan with these units.  I would like to 
flatten out our book (ie) ensure there are good homes for or divest of all 
our existing turbines before we look at purchasing additional units for 2002.

Dorie, I have to question the effectiveness of this program.  Over the years, 
it appears that more spots are being filled by Enron people then customers. 
The effectiveness of this forum from a customer point of view is 
questionable.  I vote to kill it.

Please forgive the approach - but I would like to provoke a discussion with 
my partners.

Body:
I would like to thank all of you for putting quality time and effort into 
this important process.  There is nothing more important to ENA than 
attracting and retaining the most talanted and innovative people.

Effectively immediately, written and oral feedback for commercial managers 
and directors can be delivered. As per our discussion, the PRC process is 
primarily a feedback, performance management and staff planning tool.  It 
provides a data point for bonus purposes; however, it is not the only 
determinant.  In the interest of ensuring the most effective performance 
management tool, I would suggest that we implement the following:
 a)For employees ranked in the strong and above categories, the ultimate 
ranking should not be communicated and the message should focus on progress 
towards identified commercial goals and objectives and progress towards the 
further development of desirable leadership and commerical capabilities. 
Written and oral feedback should be delivered immediately;
 b) For employees ranked in the satisfactory, needs improvement and issues 
category, the ultimate ranking should be communicated to ensure approriate 
documentation of performance and to stimulate a plan to rectify or cure 
performance issues.  For the satisfactory category, the message should focus 
on increasing deal-flow, financial performance and productivity.  The bar is 
always being raised.  For the needs improvement category, the message should 
focus on turning around poor performance over the next six months.  For the 
issues category, the business unit manager should determine, in conjunction 
with your HR rep., the appropriate plan to find a better "fit" in the 
organization or counsel out.  Regardless, the ENA Office of the Chairman will 
require a written plan of action for all employees in the needs improvement 
and issues category from the business unit manager documenting the plan of 
action to rectify performance.

Vice President ranking can not be communicated until after the Enron VP PRC 
currently scheduled for July 31st.  I anticipate a similar process as above 
with our officer feedback process.  Associate and Analyst rankings can not be 
communicated until after the Enron A&A PRC currently scheduled for July 19th.

Other identified action items from the meetings include:
 a) the HR group will put together a "profile and performance book" for ENA's 
A&A's to ensure our representatives can augment performance information at 
the July 19th meeting;
 b) ENA will be aggressively attempting to retain highest performing A&A's to 
continue rotating within ENA;
 c) ENA will be holding an additional "off-cycle" A&A super-saturday for 
Houston and Portland in August to augment our capabilities in this area;
 and d) your HR representative is building a pipeline of outside employment 
candidates for your review each week.  Please review these resumes in a 
timely basis and let them know your interest or lack thereof.

Please communicate to your organization as appropriate.

Regards
Mark and Dave

Energy Novice to Be Paid $240,000 
 Power: Hefty annual salary goes to consultant with one year's experience in the field. State officials say she is doing a good job. 


By JEFFREY L. RABIN, DARYL KELLEY, Times Staff Writers





     The Davis administration is paying a young business consultant with barely a year's experience in the energy industry $240,000 annually to head a team of traders who secure California's daily electricity supply. 
     State officials hired Susan T. Lee, 30, in April without competitive bidding under an emergency declaration by Gov. Gray Davis. 
     Lee's contract is equal to the $20,000 a month that Davis pays his chief energy advisor, S. David Freeman, a top utility executive for decades. 
     The two-year contract will pay Lee up to $480,000 to oversee the state's day-to-day energy purchases, totaling billions of dollars a year. 
     Lee's contract reflects the pressure and difficulties the state says it faces to fill key jobs in its new role as one of the nation's largest power buyers, a role that it took on in January as California's utilities faltered. 
     Lee's contract was one of about a dozen released Monday, and among the largest. 
     Reached at her Sacramento office, Lee would not discuss her contract. She said only that she heads a 15-person team of traders and schedulers that works long hours to keep California's power flowing. 
     Pete Garris, a contracts manager for the state Department of Water Resources who recruited Lee, said he met her at industry meetings and had been impressed by her savvy. 
     He said he gave her a pay raise to lure her to state service in April after Ron Shimizu, her boss at Mieco Inc., a trading firm in Long Beach, recommended her. Shimizu refused comment Tuesday. 
     The state, according to Garris, must compete for employees against an aggressive energy industry and pay good salaries to stay in the game. 
     "You can consider this situation to be very extraordinary," Garris said. "Unless we can get permanent and full-time positions approved, these are the rules we have to follow to be able to hire [consultants]." 
     Garris insisted that it is unfair to compare Lee's contract with the six-month, $120,000 deal that Freeman--the former boss at several major utilities--struck with the governor. 
     "I don't want to compare Susan Lee to David Freeman," Garris said. "David comes from the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and Susan came from a [private] power marketer. With Susan, we just followed the standard formula." 
     In her new job, Lee will direct an immensely complicated, around-the-clock operation responsible for "procuring energy, scheduling power and associated transmission, and reconciling deviations between contracts and deliveries," according to her contract. 
     Lee's resume, attached to the contract, shows that she had no experience in the energy field until March 2000, when she joined Mieco. There, she was a trader and power scheduler, not a manager. 
     "She was only here for a year or so," said Dina Alvarez, an administrative manager for the company. 
     A 1994 graduate of UCLA with a degree in economics, she worked as a pension and benefits manager in Los Angeles and New York before joining Mieco. 
     Lee's contract stands out compared to others disclosed this week, not only for its size but for her relative inexperience in the energy field. 
     She is being paid $120 an hour and can earn a maximum of $480,000, including expenses, by April 2003. 
     Another new consultant, William L. Green, has almost a quarter of a century of experience working for the Bonneville Power Administration, Pacific Gas & Electric and the California Independent System Operator. He is being paid $85 an hour to supervise workers who reconcile the state's accounting of energy purchases. His two-year deal is worth up to $340,000. 
     They are not alone in cutting lucrative deals. 
     Richard Ferreira, the former assistant general manager at the Sacramento Municipal Utilities District, has a $500,000 contract and is being paid $200 an hour to assist the state in negotiating power purchase contracts. He worked for the Department of Water Resources for 23 years before joining the Sacramento agency in 1987. 
     Hardy Energy Consulting also has a $150,000, six-month contract that calls for Randy Harvey to be paid $300 an hour. Harvey has a quarter of a century of energy experience, particularly at the Bonneville Power Administration, where he was chief executive officer from 1991 to 1997. 
     Lee's recruiter, Garris, said her lack of experience is not a concern. 
     "So far she's done an excellent job," he said. "She has the skills, and she has the ability. She was doing a similar job." 
     Dozens of consultants, including Lee, have been hired since January, when Davis declared an energy emergency and set up a special arm of government to buy power. 
     The state filled a vacuum when generators refused to sell to PG&E, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric because they were no longer considered credit-worthy, said Oscar Hidalgo, spokesman for the Department of Water Resources. 
     Hidalgo said that about 60% of the 95 people now working for the division are consultants. The rest are state employees. 
     As part of the process, Lee's unit oversees the purchase of power a day ahead of when it is needed. Hidalgo said Lee is involved in contracts that extend no more than three months.

Ed, this looks great!!!! 

 Please ensure that the focus is on coverage, deal flow and building markets. 
 I want to avoid two groups hunting strategic elephants (ie) east origination 
and development so ensure the scope is consistent with mid-market coverage 
and feeding the desk deals and info.   In the case of building or purchasing 
assets please let Jacoby's group handle.  Any deal or lead that significantly 
disrupts coverage or takes you or your people out of the market please pass 
or coordinate with origination or development

There is bound to be some conflict between the strategic origination groups 
and you - please keep to a minimum and resolve in a manner consistent with 
one team and doing the right thing.

Please provide John and I a monthly report of customer transactions 
completed, coverage plans and "market building iniatives".  

Let me know how I can assist in any way in recruiting or transactions.

Koenig/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Lisa Mellencamp/HOU/ECT@ECT 
Subject: Ecogas/Fidelity issue

Dave - I think I've worked out a solution to the Fidelity problem.  Enron 
North America and Fidelity will agree to a back to back Put/Call option 
whereby after closing the sale to PNE Enron has a 6 month Call option (thru 
6/30/01) to cash them out at the contract price (=$5.2MM less PV10 of accrued 
tax credits to date).  For the period of July 1-31, 2001 Fidelity would have 
a Put option at the same price.

This accomplishes the following:

Preserves $5MM cash for Enron by allowing us 6 months to find a new buyer for 
the tax credits and doing a back to back flip.
Preserves the integrity of the tax credits for cal 2001 (Gasco and Genco have 
to be unaffiliated) which will maximize our ability to recover our 
costs/minimize losses.
Gives Fidelity a date certain when they're out of the deal AND gives them 
optionality to stay in if they choose.
Gets the deal between Ecogas and PNE done structurally to PNE's satisfaction.

I spoke w/ Donahue about internal approvals and since Enron is already 
exposed for the $5.2MM, and the balance can only go down (not up), we didn't 
feel this would need anything other than ENA Legal and Office of the 
Chairman.  I'll assume this is correct unless I'm told otherwise.

The CFO of the PX has called for a freeze on all collateral.  We don't know 
what tariff provision allows them to do this.  I am working with attorneys to 
figure out what we can do to compel them to release our collateral.  Good 
luck.

Please forward to the person in charge of New Generation Projects.

I was referred to you by the Energy Information Agency.  I was wondering if 
you could help me find new generation work within your company.  If you are 
not in the market for additional capacity I would appreciate your comments on 
how I might proceed.

We primarily install, relocate or otherwise put power in service on a turnkey 
basis, virtually anywhere in the world.   We also do major repairs, 
mechanical and electrical, rotating equipment and even substation 
equipment.    We have a rather strange assortment of equipment to support our 
work, special hydra lift trailers for moving large engine without 
disassembly, cranes for use in trying areas, high voltage bucket trucks, a 
portable repair shop that can be moved to a major site that is 100 ft X 60 ft 
and is fully equipped for anything from turbine repairs, installs or we can 
do a large rewind ..

For off-shore work we have a floating shop, a service vessel that has 
equipment on-board to move generation or also do similar service and 
repairs.     An example might be a turbine or other generation installation 
even on a barge power plant that is in service .. we can often dock along 
side and do it all as though the barge was in a harbor.

Sometimes, in addition to supplying New Equipment, we can supply used, 
refurbished or surplus assets.  Several possible powerplants considered for 
relocation are made available by Marcor Remediation Inc.  Marcor is working 
with the Jacksonville Electric Authority, Basin Electric and other major US 
utilities to offer certain Surplus Generating Assets to the worlds energy 
sectors.  This equipment is listed in some detail on our company webpage
(http://www.marcor.com/services/sales/sales.htm.)    This is a partial 
listing so let me know if your company contacts are in the market for 
anything in particular, we may be able to help.

These are additional properties I am working on, we handle Turnkey 
installations all over the world as well as a good deal of offshore work.   
Currently, we can deliver an LM 6000, up and running in less than 90 days.

BARGE MOUNTED POWER PLANT, 100+ MEGAWATT


We can provide a 100+  MW Barge Mounted Power Plant, complete, ABS Certified, 
consisting of two (2) 50 MW Gas Turbine Generators.
Outputs are at ISO conditions.  These units will be refurbished and ready to 
operate on either Natural Gas or Fuel Oil and installed on an ABS certified 
barge.  Delivery can occur within approximately 120 working days (4 months) 
after receipt of funds as specified below.
The two Gas Turbines will be set up to operate singularly or in parallel.
The Generator output will be 10,800 volts, 3-phase, 50 HZ.  (With upgrade to 
60 HZ available)  The power will be transported to shore by overhead 
transmission lines at Generator voltage.  A control room will be provided 
together with switchgear and circuit disconnects.

The customer/buyer will be responsible for providing all fuel needs including 
delivery and storage of fuel.  The customer will also be responsible for all 
Grid connections and transformation of power.

We will provide, as part of the Barge package, an emergency generator for 
lighting and Barge pumps.  The Turbines can be started with electric motors 
powered from the emergency generator (diesel fueled) or by pressurized air.

All of this equipment is offered subject to prior sale.  The costs will be 
adjusted accordingly if additional or substitute equipment is required by 
customer.

The two (2) Gas Turbines can be adapted to operate on Heavy Fuel (HFO) or 
Bunker "C" or #6 Fuel oil, providing proper oil treatment modules are 
utilized.  We will offer this equipment under separate Contract.

ESTIMATE OF COSTS:
100 + MW Power Barge can be furnished as described for approx. $300.00 USD/ 
kW or $ 30,000,000.00.
Any commissions, "finders fees", or other unidentified costs, shall be added 
to the cost shown here.  At this price, USED equipment is utilized.

To prepare a formal quotation and provide detailed equipment specifics, i.e. 
model numbers, serial numbers, etc., a one-percent (1%) Cash Advance shall be 
placed in an escrow account with draws for the preparation of same and 
expenses incurred.  An Executed "Non-Disclosure, Non-Compete, Non-Circumvent 
Agreement" must be signed by the "end-user".  It will take two (2) weeks, 
after receipt of one-percent (1%) cash advance funds, and after ALL pertinent 
information regarding the ultimate construction of the barge is received by 
us from the buyer, to prepare the Formal Quotation.

After receipt of the Formal Quotation/Proposal,  buyer shall have two (2) 
weeks to place a five-percent (5%) refundable deposit which will allow him 
thirty (30) days to perform "due diligence".  At the end of this "due 
diligence" period, buyer shall pay eighty-five percent (85%) of the total 
purchase price.  The balance due shall be paid upon customer acceptance of 
the unit.

Currently, we have a "window" of opportunity open to immediately initiate 
necessary engineering work.  This work will be accomplished by "World Class" 
Maritime Contractors; therefore, meeting the highest of Standards.

Body:
About a month ago I held a  meeting in Houston to bring together the systems, operations, and commercial people who were responsible for designing and building our wholesale and retail systems.  There were probably twenty people there, including Beth Perlman, Anthony Dayao, Beth Appollo, Bob Hall, Leslie Reeves, Lloyd Will, Todd Busby, Greg Woulfe, Rogers Herndon, Murray O'Neil, Steve Nat, Jeff Richter, Thresa Allen, Pablo ?, Mark Pickering, Dale Furrow, and many more.  

Two of my suspicions were confirmed in this meeting.  First, it was clear that there were a bunch of people working in silos.  Beth's group was just starting to talk to Anthony's group.  The site profile team wasn't on the same page as Richter who wasn't necessarily in sync with Herndon.  EES and ENA (and for that matter east ENA and west ENA) volume management and RTO settlements people weren't talking to one another.  Second, it was clear that nobody had tried to map out what all of the necessary functions are and how they should fit together.  We tasked Todd Busby, Debra Bailey, and Lloyd Will to spend a month talking to each group and "drawing the picture" of all of the systems that were being worked on and how they should fit together.  They brought in a couple of people from Accenture to assist with this project.

The powerpoint presentation below documents their findings.  I would encourage you to look at pages 11 through 15 which summarize the issues and recommendations.  Here are the highlights:
Power IT and operations remain organizationally divided between Wholesale and Retail
Settlements development efforts are not global
Create one power IT & one operations organization for retail and wholesale power
Create power program management team to coordinate business requirements for trading, risk, settlements & volume mngt across wholesale and retail desks

Our systems and operations efforts are in chaos right now in terms of getting prepared for the future of wholesale and retail power.  If you think about how decisions and priorities are established you have a half dozen commercial people (me, Richter, Presto, Will, Herndon, Woulfe, ...) working with a few operations people (White, Appollo, Albrecht, O'Neil, Hall) and a handful of systems people (Dayao, Nat, Stock, Perlman) to come up with a plan.  It just isn't working.  We need a structure and we need it fast.  Chaos is expensive and ineffective.

Here's what I want:
One Operations Person Responsible for Wholesale and Retail Power
One Systems Person Responsible for Wholesale and Retail Power
One Commercial Person Responsible for Overseeing All Wholesale and Retail Power Systems Development
One Project Manager Working for the Commercial Person to Coordinate and Run Herd Over These Efforts.

There are a number of variants of what I want that could work.  We need to get this thing figured out ASAP.  Please advise on how you recommend moving forward.

Tim,

I made the following changes to the presentation which are not required for your distribution if you have already sent it out:

1.  page 10 first bullet - changed "one power and operations organization" to "one power and one operations organization" .

2.  page 11 - modified colors to clarify point

Please plan on attending a meeting on Wednesday January 2nd at 11 AM in Mt. Hood.

During the first two weeks of January we would like to hold training sessions for people in our office.  The goal is to provide an overview of each major function in our office to anyone who is interested in learning about what goes on here.  My current thinking is to spend an hour each day, say from 11 AM until noon, in training.  One or more people from each group will be responsible for coming up with an outline/agenda and leading an hour long session on what you do.  If you have received this e-mail, you have been tentatively nominated by me to lead or co-lead one of the training sessions.

Here are the sessions that I propose:

Overview		Tim Belden and/or Chris Calger
Risk			John Postlethwaite
Scheduling		Stacey Runswick, Donald Robinson, Diane Cutsforth
Fundamentals		Tim Heizenrader
Real Time		Bill Williams
Term Trading		Matt Motley
Cash Trading		Sean Crandall
California Market	Jeff Richter
Middle Market		Stewart Rosman and Paul Choi
Services		Chris Foster
Credit			Susan Rance
RTO Development	Alan Comnes
Legal			Christian Yoder
BPA			Steve Hall

Here are some ideas to consider for presentations:
What does your job entail -- important timelines and workflow during the day.
Inputs and Outputs to your job -- information and people
Who are your internal/external customers?
What is the purpose of your job?
Lingo - what is the vocabulary of your job?

At our meeting I would like to brainstorm potential ideas for the presenations and get some group input on what should be covered and how it should be covered.  Thanks for your help with this.

I know how incredibly busy you all are, so I'm sure that making a pledge to Jeff for the MS150 has simply slipped your mind.  Well the ride is this weekend, time is running out and we need you!

Enron's goal is to raise $700,000, and Jeff's personal goal is to raise $50,000.  As of today, we are a little better than half way there.  Won't you consider helping him reach his goal?

Thanks for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing from you tomorrow...

Sherri :-)

ENA Mid-Year 2000 Senior Management and High Value Contributors Equity Awards

Mary,

As discussed yesterday, I have had further discussions with Dave and John on 
this subject and we would like to proceed as follows;

- Wait for mid-year PRC discussions to conclude July 7
- Make recommendations for option grants to key first 6 month contributors 
and new management players following week
- Strike equity and communicate to recipients Aug 1

The rationale for this would be as follows:

- ENA has had a stellar first 6 months and will probably over exceed plan by 
$150mm
- 5 or 6 individuals have been instrumental in creating exceptional value and 
we would like to recognise their performance now.
- A number of people have over the last 6 months been asked to step up and 
take more senior roles following the moves to EBS and ENW. We would like to 
recognise these people now (subject to top 2 PRC performance) by granting 
them some options.
- As a consequence of some people's increased responsibilities and in looking 
at their unvested equity value, a number of people appear low in relation to 
the market.

I would anticipate that the individual awards would be of 7 year options with 
standard vesting and would mainly be of individual 5-10,000 options awards 
(or $145-$290k). These might total in the region of 150-250,000 options.

While most of the probable recipients will be commercial officers, I would 
expect a number of senior support and some Commercial Directors also to be 
recommended.

Obviously I understand that we will need to put individual cases together for 
each recipient for board submission but I would appreciate your help and 
guidance as we proceed. In particular please alert me asap if you think this 
will be a problem.

Thanks

David

As a shareholder I am extremely happy that you are heading over to EES.  
There is a business there.  They just need some help with the execution and 
implementation.  

I'm sorry to see you leave ENA.  The management style that you and John have 
brought to this organization is the best I've seen.  The attention to details 
and teamwork are really impressive.  Personally, I want to say thanks for all 
of the support that you have provided to me and the West Power Team over the 
last year.  Everything from acknowledging our suceessful business model to 
helping us to refine it through improved metrics in the middle market to 
supporting me and my guys through the PRC process has been greatly 
appreciated!

With EES' large position in the west I'm sure we will be working together in 
the future.  Let me know if there is anything that I can do to help.  Good 
luck.

Regards,
Tim

Dave, both Rob and I have booked for Vegas.  We will get in on Thurs. 
afternoon and leave Sunday AM ( millly ) and Afternoon for me.

John called me yesterday and he wants to Golf, Fri, Sat, Sun.  

1. We now have 5 people right?   Even if we have 5 it will be fine. Davies is 
still considering this ( I will let you know ). 
2.  I will look into golf arrangements once we have a firmer head count and 
determine when to play.. 

When and how often do you want to golf ?  

Milly and I are up for playing every day. I am thinking Friday afternoon.  
Saturday afternoon, and Sunday am ( 10:00 or so ). 

There is a great golf course ( TPC @ Canyons ) that I am trying to get us 
on.  The Desert Inn is closed while we are there. 

Thanks,

Jim, I really don't see a need for this meeting - you can count on us not 
dropping the ball.  I have a good understanding of the retail product 
offering, in fact, we lead the outsourcing sales process for the large 
industrial customers in NA until EES bought back their minority 
shareholders.  I have a very good relationship with Dan Leff and Sunde.  I 
already have Dan's committment to help service the execution of the business 
initially.  As it grows and the product proves itself out we can staff.

My assistant will be putting together a meeting/conference call for next 
WEdnesday on how to move forward with retail in South America given the plan 
to have retail report through the wholesale group in South America for 2001.  
Key points for discussion will be:

-brief overview of the state of the retail business in South America
-brief overview of the current retail organization and how it would report 
through wholesale
-discussion of how we  move from where we are currently (good value 
proposition, customer's signed up, organization to implement)  to make the 
retail business a success:
 -by having an interface with EES for best practices, systems, etc., 
 -under wholesale budget and organization for simplicity and cost sake


Wednesday is Mark's first day back in the office from Europe, Dan will be in 
Europe, Orlando will be in Brazil, others I believe in Houston, so we will 
try to accomodate everyone's schedules or at least get a quorum of those 
involved present on the call/meeting.

How do you want the Technical Analysis group handled for yearend PRC?  It is 
my understanding that they report directly to the OOC and as such, will not 
be included in any of the other business unit PRC's (i.e. EIM, East Orig, 
etc.).  Options are:

1. Have a tech analysis prc for the approx. 24 employees (portland and 
houston based) and the ratings are final  (however, who will give ratings for 
Mays and Virgo)
2. We ask one of the commercial teams to allow them to be discussed in their 
meeting (which will give cross  calibration and consensus).
3. Explore the possiblity of including them in a "functional" meeting with 
OEC or EECC?

Please give me your thoughts!

Fran

I am amenable to many different allocation methods.  I think that John has a good point.  John, the allocation for Canada includes both Toronto and Calgary.  However, there is also an argument that there should be some fixed component and a transaction-based component.  

I think that we need to come up with one methodology that applies to Canada, West, and East.  What methodology do you guys want to use?

Since Alberta Power trades 15 times/day and East and West power trade in excess of 1000 times/day, I believe that a 10% allocation for my desk is inappropriate.  I would be willing to settle for 5% and I believe that this is more that generation/

To: ENA and EGM Employees, Enron Industrial Markets, Enron Europe
cc: Executive Committee and Assistants 
Subject: Organization Announcement


We are pleased to announce the following organization changes within Enron 
Global Markets (EGM).

Larry Lawyer will be joining EGM effective immediately to lead our new 
finance activities.  In this role, he will work with all commodity products, 
assets, and teams worldwide to lever our existing businesses with this new 
focus.  Larry has worked as treasurer and was responsible for 3rd party 
financing for EBS for the last year.  He has worked for Enron for 4 1/2 years 
in various positions in the finance area.  He will be reporting to the Office 
of the Chairman.

Eric Gonzales will be joining the LNG team and will co-head this effort with 
Rick Bergsieker.  We believe there is significant opportunity in the 
worldwide LNG markets, and Eric will direct all merchant activity and focus 
on the Atlantic regions of the world.  He will also manage the LNG shipping 
book.  Eric is located in the London office and also has responsibility for 
leading the newly formed Pool Markets origination group reporting to Joe 
Gold.    

Rick Bergsieker has relocated to Dubai, in the UAE.  He is responsible for 
all Middle East activities and projects, managing the Puerto Rico assets and 
will co-head the worldwide LNG efforts.  Rick has over 20 years of LNG 
experience and together, he and Eric will form an outstanding leadership team 
as we expand Enron,s LNG activities around the world.  They both will report 
to the Office of the Chairman.  

Jennifer Fraser will come over and develop our market fundamentals group for 
all products in EGM, much like ENA natural gas and power fundamentals and 
Intranet pages existing today.  Previously, Jennifer was working in the Mid 
Market origination group.  Heather Purcell will be joining this group 
developing the commercial interface for our Intranet page.  Heather was with 
Azurix, where she worked on the platform interface for their eBusiness 
initiatives. 

Gary Hickerson will be chairing our Traders, Roundtable.  This new group will 
be comprised of traders across Enron's wholesale trading and risk management 
businesses.  This forum will give traders the opportunity to discuss topics 
important to their individual markets, and to learn and explore other markets 
in a macro sense.  Also, we will be forming a cross-commodity trading group.  
Traders who have shown extremely strong and consistent profitability will 
have the opportunity to join this group and to exploit cross-commodity 
opportunities with a bias toward structural shifts in markets.  This group 
will not be involved in customer activity and will execute through our 
principal desks.   Gary will manage this new group, as well as continuing 
with his current F/X, Rates, Equity, and Agriculture initiatives. 

Please join us in congratulating everyone on their new positions.  
Organization charts outlining the entire EGM organization are available upon 
request from Cathy Phillips.

We have the AIG Highstar Fund in ENA.  As I understand it ENA committed to $12.5M on this with the other 50% coming from EE&CC.  I understand from Dave that you are taking the P&L swings on this fund.  As they are about to pull further on this money (<1m to date), I wondered how you wanted it treating.

Let's discuss

Dan, in response to the following memo, can you discuss with Rick his ideas.  I would also like to go through a detailed description of each EES office, its people and functions to determine which should be eliminated and which should be modified.  Given the latest redeployments and terminations the field offices are a shadow of their previous stature either way.  This is consistent with our overall strategies but perhaps we want to accelerate.  If you could help set up the framework to discuss I would much appreciate.

Good job on handling the "5's".

Subject:	Remote Offices- Suggestions

After reviewing the Doorstep audit at Long Beach with the team I have the following conclusion:

1. We should shut these offices down because we can not control them. They don't make much money and will be a huge negative after losses at Long Beach.

---or----

2. We establish a rigid template for how these offices operate. My thought is that we create a McDonalds Hamburger type operation. Each office is exactly the same and operates under precise and well communicated rules. "Hamburger" quality is monitored from Houston routinely.

There are a huge number of these remote offices so we need to address how we proceed.

Any thoughts? Rick

Subject: Nella Cappelletto - Resignation


It is with great regret that I announce that Nella has resigned from Enron 
Canada effective July 14th.  Nella has been with Enron Canada for 61/2 years, 
including many of the formative years.  

Nella has been an extraordinarily valuable asset to Enron Canada and she will 
be greatly missed.  Frankly, for all Nella has done for Enron Canada, and the 
dedication, commitment and sincerity with which she has done it, she cannot 
be replaced.  Nella has been instrumental in the development and ongoing 
maintenance and administration of our contracting forms, precedent systems, 
confirmation letters, contracting files, contract diarization and data base 
systems,  and has had significant input on the development and/or 
implementation of key corporate and managerial policies and controls.  

More importantly, Nella always appreciated that, because of the nature of our 
business, our core assets are our contractual rights, and with much personal 
commitment, and often at much personal expense, Nella always endeavored to 
ensure that things not only got done, but that they got done properly and 
punctually.  I know that Linda, Greg, Mark and I (and many of you) will 
discover aspects of our jobs which we did not know existed because they were 
so capably and quietly looked after by Nella.

Most importantly, Nella had great personal commitment to do all she could 
within the limits of available resources to help us achieve our personal 
objectives at Enron Canada, whether or not realistic.  Many of us, in many 
cases without even knowing it, could not have achieved many of our own 
individual accomplishments at Enron Canada without Nella's commitment and 
dedication.

Nella will be missed, and I ask you to bear with us as we continue to try 
meet your requests until we are able to hire a suitable replacement.

Regards, Peter.

Body:
Ken, I have taken a look at the material you had sent me on the ARC Northern 
Gas Pipeline Route.  Ultimately, I believe that ARC is looking for certain 
strategic investors to provide founding capital to fund the development of 
this proposal.  To the extent that this is a open access non-discriminatory 
pipe, ENA's opportunity lies in being a shipper to capitalize on basis 
markets or customer transactions that provide attractive risk reward 
characteristics. Other than understanding the potential flows and costs, 
there is probably not much we need to do today given a 2006 start from an ENA 
point of view.

The ARC consortium needs to fund approximately $30M to develop this project.  
The US and Canadian aboriginal groups will receive 33% ownership for $10M.  
the remaining $20M and 67% will be funded by a group of producers, pipelines, 
venture capital and the "organizing group" (40%!!).  Stan Horton, if he 
believes this is a commercial possibility, may want to provide a few million 
of founding capital to the venture in order to preserve him the option to 
participate as an equity holder or operator if this becomes a reality.

Subject: Dow Jones Gas vs. Coal feature

FYI


=DJ Pricey Natural Gas May Alter New US Power Plant Options

  HOUSTON (Dow Jones)--High natural gas prices could slow the stampede to
build
as much as 140,000 megawatts of new electric generation across the U.S. and
give
new coal technology the boost it needs to compete economically with gas in
the
future.
  While market observers say the recent level of the price of natural gas -
above $4.00 per million British thermal unit since late May - may not be
sustainable, many expect gas to remain above $3.00/MMBtu for the foreseeable
future.
  The jump in gas prices is blamed on a number of factors, from increased
demand
to fuel new power plants to stagnant U.S. gas production and a lack of
available
gas reserves in storage.
  Pricier gas could create a variety of effects on future electric
generation:
from damping interest in building some new gas-fired plants to improving
economic prospects for investment to upgrade or build new coal-fired plants.

  Current gas prices are off the chart when compared to existing forecasts
from
the Energy Information Institute, part of the U.S. Department of Energy. EIA
projects the average U.S. wellhead price of gas will only rise to
$2.81/MMBtu by
2020, up from an average of $1.96/MMBtu in 1998, a jump of 43%. EIA predicts
coal prices will fall by 28% during the same period.
  Continued high natural gas prices may mean some proposed combined-cycle
gas
plants are never built, predicts a Midwest utility coal buyer. "It's awfully
hard for a combined-cycle gas plant to compete with coal. No way they can do
it
at these prices."
  However, a recent report from Raymond James and Associates Inc., concluded
that gas-fired generation will still be economical this summer even if gas
prices climb above $7.00/MMBtu because of high power prices in most regional
US
wholesale markets.

  Future Gas Supply Questioned; Coal Won't 'Go Away'

  "The gas turbine generation trend is not over, not by a long shot," said
the
Raymond James report. "Gas turbines use gas more efficiently than the
nation's
fleet of older, conventional boiler-driven generators that are fired by gas.
The
efficiency gains enabled by gas turbine generation will be more valuable as
gas
prices rise."
  While gas-fired plants are much cheaper and quicker to build than
traditional
coal-fired plants, many industry observers doubt that U.S. gas supply can
grow
to meet future demand, expected to reach 30 trillion cubic feet or more per
year
by 2020.
  "Coal will not go away," said Steve Bergstrom, president of Dynegy Inc.
(DYN).
"The coal industry will figure it out. There are too many jobs involved and
it's
too cheap."
  Bergstrom expects the rapidly expanding appetite for electricity across
the
U.S., which is growing 3% per year, will require additional generation from
many
fuel sources.
  "You'll see gas will be used in most of the additional generation for the
next
four to five years," he predicted. "In the latter half of the decade, you'll
see
other alternatives, like coal, come into play. Technology will create
changes."
  Even some independent power producers who are rushing to build gas-fired
power
plants in the U.S. admit the recent price of gas, if prolonged, is a threat.

  Bob Kelly, Calpine Corp.'s (CPN) senior vice president, said his firm's
fleet
of 40,000 MW of highly efficient natural gas plants to be in place by 2004
will
be profitable even with gas at $4.00/MMBtu, but he expects owners of
coal-fired
plants to make additional capital investment to keep those plants running as
well.
  "If gas stays $4.00 forever, you'll see more coal plants. It will make
sense
to put scrubbers on," said Kelly.

  Southern Co. Evaluating Coal-to-Gas Technology

  Gas has to compete on price with other available fuel, agreed Bob Carter,
chairman of Panda Energy International. Carter told Dow Jones Newswires late
last month that the idea of new coal-fired generation is "very possible."
  In fact, the jump in gas prices has given a boost to Southern Co.'s (SO)
effort to build a first-of-its-kind coal plant that seeks to be cost and
environmentally competitive with natural gas, said Charles H. Goodman,
Southern
Co.'s vice president for research and environmental affairs.
  Southern, with major DOE funding, recently announced a major advance in
its
effort to utilize coal in a more efficient and less polluting fashion to
generate electricity.
  The new process combines use of a "transport reactor," a device based on
existing technology used to "crack" crude oil into lighter products, to turn
coal into a gas which is then burned in a combustion turbine much like
natural
gas.
  In its gaseous form, coal can be cleaned of many of its pollutant-forming
impurities such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter,
Goodman said.
  The key to the technology is the ability to burn the coal gas in a highly
efficient gas turbine rather than burning it to make steam to turn a
turbine, he
added.
  The new technology can produce 100 megawatts of power with two-thirds less
coal than a traditional boiler-type coal generator, said Goodman.
  And higher natural gas prices could move this technology closer to a
reality.
  "The urgency of getting on with this (coal technology) is the forecast for
gas
prices," said Goodman. "At $2.50/MMBtu, it's a bigger stretch for this coal
plant (to compete with gas) than at $3.00 or $3.50/MMBtu."

  New Coal Technology May Also Address Emissions

  Goodman said Southern hopes to make a decision in the second half of 2001
on
whether to build a commercial power plant with the coal gasification
technology
now being tested at Southern's Power Systems Development Facility in
Wilsonville, Ala.
  If gas prices stay high or remain volatile, Goodman said that will
influence
the timing, size and other variables associated with building the first
full-size plant to burn coal gas in this manner.
  "The $64 question is the price of gas," said Goodman. If gas is cheap and
plentiful, utilities will have a harder time investing in coal technology,
he
said.
  But because the U.S. has abundant coal resources, Goodman predicts the
coal-to-gas technology could eventually be used not only for new plants but
to
repower existing coal plants in a way that addresses air quality concern.
  Other partners in the Power Systems Development Facility include the
Electric
Power Research Institute, Foster Wheeler Corp. (FWC), Halliburton's Kellogg
Brown & Root (HAL), Peabody Group, Combustion Power Corp. and
Siemens-Westinghouse Power.

Two conference calls have been tenatively scheduled to allow you to directly discuss Enron's commitment to its credit ratings with senior managers at Standard & Poor's and Moody's (Ben Glisan will join you in your office at the times detailed below).  Both agencies have been briefed on the contents of next week's earnings release as well as the pending equity adjustment associated with the Raptor transactions.  On Monday, our analysts at both agencies will be briefing their rating committees on the Enron announcement.  They will then contact us with their official rating decision.  Andy, Ben and I feel that a proactive call from you today will positively impact the message our analysts deliver to their committees.

Based upon the discussions with the analysts held over the last two days it is apparent that several key assurances from Enron senior management are sought.  They are as follows:

Enron is Committed to Maintaining its Credit Ratings - emphasize that the ratings are critical to the fundamental businesses which drive our success, gas and power marketing.  Note that both our counterparties and creditors place great weight on our consistent rating profile.  Due to this, the agencies should be confident that we will aggressively defend the ratings.
Our Core Businesses are Strong - We are the leading franchise in energy marketing.  We anticipate continued strength in the financial performance from the commodity groups.  No charges to be taken are associated with our ongoing businesses.
Portland General and Other Asset Sales will Occur - Proceeds from these divestitures are material and will be applied first to allow us to get our leverage statistics back in line quickly.  
Reemphasize Your Commitment To Simplifying Financial Reporting - The analysts have given considerable consideration to you public statements associated with providing more detailed information to the financial community regarding our performance.  
Acknowledge Remaining Issues Facing the Company - The agencies are following the developments on Dhabol, the valuation of the EBS fiber optic network, and the ongoing Azurix/Wessex performance.  Provide comfort that we believe the ultimate resolution of these items will not have a material adverse impact on our credit.

If you have any questions or comments, Ben will join you 15 minutes prior to the first call.

Tim, in the east power group and the gas groups, we are trying to build a 
mid-market capability(deal flow, information and coverage) consistent with 
the largest energy merchant in N.A..

Please see tha attached.  I would be curious to talk to you about your 
structure, coverage functions and market building iniatives.  

I recognize that you and your group have been the most effective and 
proactive group in these areas for some time.  Is there areas where we could 
be more aggressive or proactive?  Can I get you more resources to cover the 
market more aggresively?  
 
Lets discuss.

I am making good progress.  I have met with Mike, Matt, Bob, and Jeff.  It sounds like Mike is done, the rest are close.  I told each of them that this is a "fill or kill" bid.  If they like it then we'll get done, if not then we can revisit at the end of their existing contracts.  I also told each of them that if the market changes between now and then that it's their risk.  I also said that if they value keeping their options open that they better figure out some way to monetize their theta as Enron would not be in a position to make them whole for what they would have been paid had they chosen not to keep their options open.

I still have a couple of issues.  One is Greg Wolfe.  I am thinking that his package should look quite similar to Motley's.  I need to show him numbers today and would like to talk with one or both of you about it before I talk to Greg.  I want to show him numbers for a two-year and a three-year contract.  He is currently talking to AEP, Calpine, and Arizona Public Service.  He is asking for a lot of money to stay:  Base of 200, signing of 100, annual retention of 100 plus equity of 600 with a two year vest.  He would also do a 3 year deal with equity of 800 with a three year vest.  I have talked a little bit with Mike S. about how important Wolfe is to the Northwest Middle Market effort.  The answer was that he is really important because he knows all of the customers, he knows Enron's internal process, and he is very good at working with Mike to get deals executed and papered properly.  Having said that, Mike said that he supports whatever decision I come up with in terms of retaining Wolfe -- in other words, if he leaves then he leaves and Mike is ok with that.

I'd like to talk to one of you this afternoon to hear your thoughts and ideas on this.  I'll give you a call.

The ISO Market Surveillance Committee recently filed a report at FERC where it estimated the excess profits earned by in-state generators and importers as a direct result of individual exercise of market power.  They came up with a number of approximately $500 million.  They then quantified the impact that this had on the rest of the market and came up with a number of around $6 billion.  They used codes to identify individual market participants.  The media has now received the matching of code names to company names.  The Oregonian picked up an LA Times - Washington Post Service article yesterday highlighting the excess profits earned by PowerEx, BPA, and LADWP.  Enron Energy Services is rumored to be on this list.  I have no idea why.  I thought I'd give you guys a heads up in case media calls start coming in.  Alan Comnes (503-464-8129) is probably the best source if you want more facts on this.

Thanks for the message.  I appreciate your responses to my August 8 memo and 
agree that the deal you are currently proposing looks alot closer to the deal 
we had been discussing with TXU.  As far as negotiating approach is 
concerned, my intention was not to retrade our deal, but frankly your team's 
approach up until your recent response certainly suggested that you were.  As 
we considered our options, we used the time to scrub our economics and as I 
think Jim Noles told you, have discovered that our economics have 
deteriorated (significantly).  Not your fault/problem, but a real issue for 
me.  I have my people looking at the deal again to see if we can offer some 
creative suggestions to improve the deal for us (without killing you).  At 
the end of the day, I want to do this deal; but I can't do an uneconomic 
deal. By the way, the other parties who signed up with TXU all did so in the 
$26-27.5 range (energy and RECs), suggesting that our deal for you is way 
under market.  I am committed to pushing hard to get this deal done!  Let's 
talk later this week once my team hooks up with yours to see if we have a way 
forward.  Adam

Subject: Indian Mesa

Adam, I believe that we have formally responded to all your issues as per 
your memo to me of August 8, 2000. In all or almost all cases, we have 
accepted your position.  The agreement should look and behave very closely to 
what you would have signed with the competing utility. In addition, ENA is 
paying a higher price, sharing credits and have voluntarily increased the 
term to twelve years from ten.

I do not understand what is holding up completing this transaction other than 
a complete re-trade on the original transaction. I hope this is not the 
case.  The ENA team worked hard to facilitate this transaction for Enron 
Wind.  In fact, we were originally solicited by Enron Wind to help build the 
merchant wind market and we had to coax Enron Wind to do this transaction 
with ENA versus TXU.

I look forward to finding a solution to this current impasse.

Regards
Delainey

Greg, we maybe should discuss - I don't know that I disagree with Rogers action.  My understanding is that we have added $10/MWhr premium on all deals until further notice;  however, the impact of possible customer decision delays, un-available curves and the resulting idle sales force could cause a significant issue for Q3 retail financials.  If the net result is some downtime for a couple days probably no problem - if it is more than a couple days it is very difficult to catch up.  I will keep you in the loop.

Subject:	Real Time Pricing In Effect

Everyone -
 
Effective immediately we are instituting real time pricing requirements for ALL deals due to the increased volatility and temporary liquidity issues in the energy and financial markets.  This does not mean we are not offering products.  It does mean that the Matrix/Direct Pricing will not be valid until further notice.   Any deals executed as of 9/12 will need the direct approval of Berney Aucoin or myself.  Please coordinate any pricing requests through Sean Holmes and the Deal Management Group.  I am certain that everyone will understand the need to implement these requirements given the circumstances.  I apologize for the inconvenience and plan to return to normal procedure as soon as conditions permit.
 
Please call with any questions.

I am giving a speech in Santa Fe in a couple of weeks.  One of the points 
that I want to make is that California set up the rules, made a strategic bet 
to go short, decided to buy all of their power on the spot market, and is now 
crying that their massive bet didn't work.  I remember reading an article in 
the San Diego Tribune from sometime in 1998 or 1999 with a quote from Steve 
Peace.  Peace talked about how the state of California ripped off a bunch of 
dumb out of state generators and wisely solved their stranded cost problem.  
Does anybody remember this article?  Does anybody have this article?  Is 
there a service that we can use to find it if we don't have it?  Let me know.

This may sound redundant considering the exercise we just completed but 
please ask your respective groups what their needs are for FULL TIME ANALYSTS 
late this summer.  These Analysts will start in the business units on August 
1, 2000 and they will be allocated on a first come first serve basis.  Please 
respond back to me no later than Monday by 5:00pm.  Also, please inquire 
about your groups' needs for FULL TIME ASSOCIATES who will be available to 
the business units on September 1, 2000.  We will be needing that number 
also.  There are 94 Analyst  and 70 Associates that will be coming on board 
this summer. This is in addition to each of your groups' immediate needs.

Subject: Names of individuals for PRC representative and commercial staffing 
lead


Per our discussion at the Executive Committee meeting this morning, please 
identify 2 representatives for the Associate and Analyst PRC process and 1 
individual as commercial staffing lead.  The criteria for these individuals 
are as follows:

PRC Representatives
The PRC for Associates and Analysts will be conducted like the VP and MD 
process.   A committee selected by Executive Committee members will 
facilitate the process.  The Office of the Chairman believes that 
participation in the Associate and Analyst PRC should be a platform for 
exposure to election to the next level in the organization.  Consequently, 
Associate PRC representatives should be Vice Presidents who are on promotion 
track to MD and Analyst representatives should be Directors who are on 
promotion track to Vice President. 

Commercial Staffing Leads
 We need your assistance to determine accurate hiring targets to ensure that 
the talent we attract will be valued and utilized meaningfully.   The Office 
of the Chairman is ultimately holding each CEO accountable for working with 
the Program Staffing Coordinators to staff the talent and to determine the 
hiring goals.  The CEO may delegate this responsibility to a highly 
respected, interested, senior commercial person.  This responsibility should 
not be delegated to an HR representative.
Please provide the names by end of the day tomorrow,  5/9/00.  Thanks, to 
those of you who have responded.
Charlene

we have had trouble valueing transmission, literally forever.  we finally released a spread option model last night to value transmission.  it spit out some huge values for out of the money transmission because it is valued as a daily option.  for example, transmission from big eddy (in the northwest) to nob spit out a value of $28 million -- all extrinsic.  given the state of affairs in california right now, i find it highly unlikely that we will take power from the northwest to deliver into the capped market.  last night we recognized $16 million of transmission value, almost all intrinsic value associated with closing open positions.  we reserved $36 million associated with extrinsic value.  we will revalue the options once a week and make appropriate adjustments to the reserves.  let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Ike, given our schedules, it appears that e-mail may be the most effective 
communication tool.  

I thought I would just follow up on progress being made in TVA on our 
settlement process.  As well, I understand that there has been a number of 
communications between TVA and Enron on the NoxTech emissions business.  I 
have encouraged the Enron folks to pursue this opportunity with TVA given the 
larger dialogue.  The Enron team has told me that TVA  wishes to move to firm 
pricing and a MOU on this technology.  Given the larger dialogue, I have 
suggested to our team to hold tight on completing the agreement until both 
TVA and Enron have a view on where the overall settlement discussions are 
going.  

Please give me a call at your earliest convenience.

Subject: Re: Retail in South America  

I will be in Houston next week and we can discuss if you want to.  The idea 
here was not to explain the retail product offering or any concern of 
dropping the ball, rather a one off download of where we currently stand in 
South America  and high level overview of  how to work together to keep 
everyone on the same sheet of music and not miss  a beat.  For instance, 
there is already a local staff in place to handle initial deal flow (which is 
already happening) that needs to benefit from Dan's systems and best 
practices, but which has already based what they are doing on how Dan 
operates.  We have always benefited from as much of Dan's and Marty's 
attention as we could get over the past year and a half as we set this up.   
By the same token we can't be competitive in this business in Brazil on a 
cost basis from Houston, so that is why we have formed local staff based on 
EES systems and practices, and hopefully some controls as we go forward.  It 
is late here and my assistant is gone but I think the meeting is already 
scheduled.  If you can't be there maybe we can backbrief you.

Jim, I really don't see a need for this meeting - you can count on us not 
dropping the ball.  I have a good understanding of the retail product 
offering, in fact, we lead the outsourcing sales process for the large 
industrial customers in NA until EES bought back their minority 
shareholders.  I have a very good relationship with Dan Leff and Sunde.  I 
already have Dan's committment to help service the execution of the business 
initially.  As it grows and the product proves itself out we can staff.

My assistant will be putting together a meeting/conference call for next 
WEdnesday on how to move forward with retail in South America given the plan 
to have retail report through the wholesale group in South America for 2001.  
Key points for discussion will be:

-brief overview of the state of the retail business in South America
-brief overview of the current retail organization and how it would report 
through wholesale
-discussion of how we  move from where we are currently (good value 
proposition, customer's signed up, organization to implement)  to make the 
retail business a success:
 -by having an interface with EES for best practices, systems, etc., 
 -under wholesale budget and organization for simplicity and cost sake


Wednesday is Mark's first day back in the office from Europe, Dan will be in 
Europe, Orlando will be in Brazil, others I believe in Houston, so we will 
try to accomodate everyone's schedules or at least get a quorum of those 
involved present on the call/meeting.

Mark/Greg, 

Please confirm your interest and availability to set aside 30 minutes, or so 
Dec 6, 7 or 8, for me in Houston this week.

I am in a final phase of an expat re-assignment or relocation and would like 
to discuss with you:

Enron's pricing, structuring and position-taking capability for South America 
etc.,.. expected to be in place from the year 2000, at least in power in 
Brazil.

Failure/Successes and immediate opportunities in the Enron Brazil and South 
America core (gas, power) and multiple commodity commercial effort(s), 
including e-business/Networks issues.

Finance expertise  - the critical role that functional groups like Enron 
Metals' (Trade and Structure Finance Group) and the Global Markets 
Insurance/Global Risk groups will (need to) play in helping develop critical, 
internal Enron finance, risk assessment and mitigation expertise to support 
the competitiveness and viability of closing commercial transactions in South 
America and elsewhere

My priority to help form and be re-assigned to a "Bundle Products" 
Origination business unit  designed to initiate transactions which 
specifically and formally leverage synergies across Enron Business Units - to 
potentially include in Brazil, at least, power, pulp & paper, steel networks, 
crude and products, and insurance/global risk. 

Please find attatched files which detail some of my ideas for developing the 
core gas and power trading and origination efforts and including the Bundled 
Product unit.   The files were appropriately forwarded to Dave/John. 




I have also attatched my CV should you be interested to review my background 
and experience and  mention, as a reminder, that a meeting is critical in 
potentially determining the outcome of my expat re-assignment or re-location 
process,  needed to be concluded this month, Dec 2000.  

Thank you for any efforts extended in my behalf.

Guys, I would like your opinion on this potential transaction.  This has been 
sold through GE for some time and it is reasonably likely that if we employed 
some additional resources that this could be completed over the next quarter 
or so.

Ultimately, Rodney and his team would like to see EES take control of the 
deal with EIM folks staying involved to ensure continuity and to assist to 
closure. Assuming that the sales process is largely completed, I see some 
value for Enron to take this deal including:
 a) $200 M in TCV for 2000;
 b) $3 to $5 M in value;
 c) GE on our EES resume of companies which will help in future sales to the 
large industrial customers;
 and d) provides an "in" to the GE family of companies which could result in 
significant up-sell capability in the future if we provide a quality product.

Subject: GE Plastics Facts

Dave,

The GE Plastics facility is located in Selkirk NY just south of Albany and 
produces polystyrene and polyphenyleneoxide.  The deal value is roughly $4-5 
million NPV of which $3-4 million may be markable income.  

The obstacles to closure are:
- the projected savings have gone from 27% to 20% when GE said they wanted 
more
- there is some capital recovery at the end of year ten that GE would have to 
pay us and they are not yet agreeable to,
- the savings include $1 million in O&M savings and it will be very difficult 
to get to closure with them letting us do the O&M

Deal Stats Are:

Electricity  230,000 mwh/yr  $12 million/yr
Steam  430,000 lbs/yr  $3   million/yr
Gas  470,000 mmbtu/yr $2   million/yr
O&M     $3   million/yr
Total     $20 million/yr

10 year contract, total contract value $200 million.

Let me know if you need any further information.
Thanks,
Rodney

=DJ Pricey Natural Gas May Alter New US Power Plant Options

  HOUSTON (Dow Jones)--High natural gas prices could slow the stampede to
build
as much as 140,000 megawatts of new electric generation across the U.S. and
give
new coal technology the boost it needs to compete economically with gas in
the
future.
  While market observers say the recent level of the price of natural gas -
above $4.00 per million British thermal unit since late May - may not be
sustainable, many expect gas to remain above $3.00/MMBtu for the foreseeable
future.
  The jump in gas prices is blamed on a number of factors, from increased
demand
to fuel new power plants to stagnant U.S. gas production and a lack of
available
gas reserves in storage.
  Pricier gas could create a variety of effects on future electric
generation:
from damping interest in building some new gas-fired plants to improving
economic prospects for investment to upgrade or build new coal-fired plants.

  Current gas prices are off the chart when compared to existing forecasts
from
the Energy Information Institute, part of the U.S. Department of Energy. EIA
projects the average U.S. wellhead price of gas will only rise to
$2.81/MMBtu by
2020, up from an average of $1.96/MMBtu in 1998, a jump of 43%. EIA predicts
coal prices will fall by 28% during the same period.
  Continued high natural gas prices may mean some proposed combined-cycle
gas
plants are never built, predicts a Midwest utility coal buyer. "It's awfully
hard for a combined-cycle gas plant to compete with coal. No way they can do
it
at these prices."
  However, a recent report from Raymond James and Associates Inc., concluded
that gas-fired generation will still be economical this summer even if gas
prices climb above $7.00/MMBtu because of high power prices in most regional
US
wholesale markets.

  Future Gas Supply Questioned; Coal Won't 'Go Away'

  "The gas turbine generation trend is not over, not by a long shot," said
the
Raymond James report. "Gas turbines use gas more efficiently than the
nation's
fleet of older, conventional boiler-driven generators that are fired by gas.
The
efficiency gains enabled by gas turbine generation will be more valuable as
gas
prices rise."
  While gas-fired plants are much cheaper and quicker to build than
traditional
coal-fired plants, many industry observers doubt that U.S. gas supply can
grow
to meet future demand, expected to reach 30 trillion cubic feet or more per
year
by 2020.
  "Coal will not go away," said Steve Bergstrom, president of Dynegy Inc.
(DYN).
"The coal industry will figure it out. There are too many jobs involved and
it's
too cheap."
  Bergstrom expects the rapidly expanding appetite for electricity across
the
U.S., which is growing 3% per year, will require additional generation from
many
fuel sources.
  "You'll see gas will be used in most of the additional generation for the
next
four to five years," he predicted. "In the latter half of the decade, you'll
see
other alternatives, like coal, come into play. Technology will create
changes."
  Even some independent power producers who are rushing to build gas-fired
power
plants in the U.S. admit the recent price of gas, if prolonged, is a threat.

  Bob Kelly, Calpine Corp.'s (CPN) senior vice president, said his firm's
fleet
of 40,000 MW of highly efficient natural gas plants to be in place by 2004
will
be profitable even with gas at $4.00/MMBtu, but he expects owners of
coal-fired
plants to make additional capital investment to keep those plants running as
well.
  "If gas stays $4.00 forever, you'll see more coal plants. It will make
sense
to put scrubbers on," said Kelly.

  Southern Co. Evaluating Coal-to-Gas Technology

  Gas has to compete on price with other available fuel, agreed Bob Carter,
chairman of Panda Energy International. Carter told Dow Jones Newswires late
last month that the idea of new coal-fired generation is "very possible."
  In fact, the jump in gas prices has given a boost to Southern Co.'s (SO)
effort to build a first-of-its-kind coal plant that seeks to be cost and
environmentally competitive with natural gas, said Charles H. Goodman,
Southern
Co.'s vice president for research and environmental affairs.
  Southern, with major DOE funding, recently announced a major advance in
its
effort to utilize coal in a more efficient and less polluting fashion to
generate electricity.
  The new process combines use of a "transport reactor," a device based on
existing technology used to "crack" crude oil into lighter products, to turn
coal into a gas which is then burned in a combustion turbine much like
natural
gas.
  In its gaseous form, coal can be cleaned of many of its pollutant-forming
impurities such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter,
Goodman said.
  The key to the technology is the ability to burn the coal gas in a highly
efficient gas turbine rather than burning it to make steam to turn a
turbine, he
added.
  The new technology can produce 100 megawatts of power with two-thirds less
coal than a traditional boiler-type coal generator, said Goodman.
  And higher natural gas prices could move this technology closer to a
reality.
  "The urgency of getting on with this (coal technology) is the forecast for
gas
prices," said Goodman. "At $2.50/MMBtu, it's a bigger stretch for this coal
plant (to compete with gas) than at $3.00 or $3.50/MMBtu."

  New Coal Technology May Also Address Emissions

  Goodman said Southern hopes to make a decision in the second half of 2001
on
whether to build a commercial power plant with the coal gasification
technology
now being tested at Southern's Power Systems Development Facility in
Wilsonville, Ala.
  If gas prices stay high or remain volatile, Goodman said that will
influence
the timing, size and other variables associated with building the first
full-size plant to burn coal gas in this manner.
  "The $64 question is the price of gas," said Goodman. If gas is cheap and
plentiful, utilities will have a harder time investing in coal technology,
he
said.
  But because the U.S. has abundant coal resources, Goodman predicts the
coal-to-gas technology could eventually be used not only for new plants but
to
repower existing coal plants in a way that addresses air quality concern.
  Other partners in the Power Systems Development Facility include the
Electric
Power Research Institute, Foster Wheeler Corp. (FWC), Halliburton's Kellogg
Brown & Root (HAL), Peabody Group, Combustion Power Corp. and
Siemens-Westinghouse Power.

Thanks for the quick response, Joe.  Peter did call me earlier this

I did, however, gleen from him that he and his investors already own the 50 
buildings (not in the process of buying them as I originally thought) and 
have +/- 100 additional properties they manage.

I'm stepping out of the middle of this one now unless there is anything 
further you need me to do.  Good luck - I hope it's a real deal - I've never

Sherri,

We would be quite interested in looking into this further.  We are currently 
working with quite a few companies to sell power under 3-5 year contract 
terms.  The customers range from large office bldgs (>2Mw and connected to 
EHV grid) to large industrials (several hundred Mw).  We are also making some 
real progress with the real estate companies and department stores to provide 
power to a number of their facilities across Japan.  There are a number of 
other initiatives where we would take an industrials self generation off 
balance sheet, upgrade facility, etc to give us access to power.  In one case 
we are progressing with a company that has 600 Mw inside the fence.

Let me know how you would like to progress.  As a point of interest, a 
particular discount product that we are offering is fully described on our 
biligual website (www.enron.co.jp).  This has been very successful for us.

Gentlemen,

You will receive a phone call from Peter Wachtell sometime over the next 
week.  I spoke to his father last night at a dinner party; Peter is putting 
together a deal in Tokyo right now to purchase 50 office buildings and manage 
another 100.  He is interested in talking to Enron about energy outsourcing.

I'm assured that this a legitimate deal, but that will be for you to decide!  
Just wanted to give you a heads up in the hopes you will take a few minutes 
to talk to him.

We continue to perform on our PX block forward sales.  Rather than deliver to 
Edison and PG&E, the PX has unilaterally decided to schedule this power as 
"load deviation" in the ISO market.  That is, it is an uninstructed deviation 
in the ISO Ex Post market so it receives the "dec" price.  This poses two 
problems.  First, the Ex Post price is a max of $150/MWh while the bilateral 
market trades significantly above this price.  Second, the ISO has payed us 
$0.02 for every $1.00 of sales that EPMI made to them in November.  We are 
racking up a receivable on this stuff of approximately $1 million per week 
(average sales price of $69.50 times a quantity of 150 peak MW).  Now the 
state has come in and taken the block forward positions.  We need to look at 
whether we must continue to perform on this obligation.

Dick and Jeff, given the facts in each case, does this appear to be a good 
trade given the market, the specifics of the company, the carrying costs of 
the asset and perhaps our desire to increase capital flow to higher return

This is clearly not a fire sale and I trust the opinion or consensus that

Dave,

Your comments on the Basic DASH are well-taken.  We will clarify what RAC 
views as the current valuation of Basic as well as RAC's recommendation with 
respect to this divestiture and modify the DASH as quickly as possible.

Your comments prompted a question with regard to ENA's divestiture strategy.  
Is it correct to assume that if we use a typical market liquidity premium of 
30% (i.e., future divestiture proceeds are 70% of the expected terminal value 
at the divestiture date to account for potential changes in future market 
conditions) in a sale deferral scenario and this deferral results in a higher 
NPV at the RAC capital price than the proposed sale proceeds, ENA would elect 
to retain the asset?  Or should a higher than "market" capital price be 
assigned by RAC to these assets earmarked for divestiture?

Regards,

Dave

Thanks for the message.  I appreciate your responses to my August 8 memo and 
agree that the deal you are currently proposing looks alot closer to the deal 
we had been discussing with TXU.  As far as negotiating approach is 
concerned, my intention was not to retrade our deal, but frankly your team's 
approach up until your recent response certainly suggested that you were.  As 
we considered our options, we used the time to scrub our economics and as I 
think Jim Noles told you, have discovered that our economics have 
deteriorated (significantly).  Not your fault/problem, but a real issue for 
me.  I have my people looking at the deal again to see if we can offer some 
creative suggestions to improve the deal for us (without killing you).  At 
the end of the day, I want to do this deal; but I can't do an uneconomic 
deal. By the way, the other parties who signed up with TXU all did so in the 
$26-27.5 range (energy and RECs), suggesting that our deal for you is way 
under market.  I am committed to pushing hard to get this deal done!  Let's 
talk later this week once my team hooks up with yours to see if we have a way 
forward.  Adam

Adam, I believe that we have formally responded to all your issues as per 
your memo to me of August 8, 2000. In all or almost all cases, we have 
accepted your position.  The agreement should look and behave very closely to 
what you would have signed with the competing utility. In addition, ENA is 
paying a higher price, sharing credits and have voluntarily increased the 
term to twelve years from ten.

I do not understand what is holding up completing this transaction other than 
a complete re-trade on the original transaction. I hope this is not the 
case.  The ENA team worked hard to facilitate this transaction for Enron 
Wind.  In fact, we were originally solicited by Enron Wind to help build the 
merchant wind market and we had to coax Enron Wind to do this transaction 
with ENA versus TXU.

I look forward to finding a solution to this current impasse.

Mark, The word on the street is that the NewPower folks are getting further in trouble (ie) strange trading activity, etc. Looks and smells a little like the old EES.

Couple of opps:
	- get another shareholder on-side and demand an Enron led audit to confirm financial and operating health;
	- followed up by hostile exit of mgt team if significant issues arise.

Issues:
	- obviously pushes us into another level of complicity/fiduciary in a blow up or bankruptcy not unlike the issues we faced with Kafus et al; however, given our continued interest a significant control issue could result in a significant acceleration of a write-off of our existing position plus any outstanding credit.

I would recommend we force the management team to submit to a detailed audit as a part of a united shareholder iniative - Lets discuss.

Rick Buy, what is our current credit position?

Greg/John, do you have a view on this one?

Rick Causey, we  probably need a more "permanent solution" ot the NewPower issue.

In support of Enron,s continuing efforts to increase its return on invested 
capital and direct resources towards our highest return businesses, David 
Haug, Chairman and CEO of Enron CALME, Jim Hughes, President and COO of Enron 
APACHI, Joe Kishkill, Managing Director of Enron South America, and Frank 
Stabler, formerly a Managing Director of Enron CALME, will join Mark Metts in 
a corporate wide effort, to help monetize some of Enron,s assets.  David will 
help transition the CALME business activities into other parts of Enron while 
working with Mark on the asset monetization projects.  David will continue as 
an Executive Vice President for Enron Corp and a member of Enron,s Executive 
Committee.  Cliff Baxter will oversee this effort.

Consistent with these changes, the CALME group will be divided as follows.  
Enron Global LNG and Enron,s Caribbean Basin activities will become part of 
the new Enron Global Markets (EGM) group headed by Mike McConnell.  Rick 
Bergsieker, President/COO of LNG will continue in that role and in his dual 
role as President/COO of Enron Middle East, which will also join EGM. Shawn 
Cumberland, President and COO of the Caribbean Basin unit and his executive 
team will carry out the transition process for the Caribbean business unit's 
people and businesses as part of EGM.  Management of its Colombia and 
Venezuela businesses will transfer to Enron South America and its LNG-related 
activities to EGM as described above. 

The EES related initiatives and people will be transferred to those units.  
All of the various international businesses will participate as usual in the 
upcoming budget process with their new alignment and continue to meet their 
plan targets for 3rd and 4th quarters.

Concurrently, we are consolidating our trading and merchant activities in 
Japan and Australia into Enron Europe.  Joe Hirl and Paul Quilkey will report 
to Enron Europe,s Office of the Chairman.

We congratulate David Haug and Rebecca McDonald for proposing these 
realignments, which we agree, will maximize both the financial and 
intellectual capital in Enron.  Over the coming weeks, specific assignments 
and reporting relationships will be determined and communicated.

(West Columbia Texas).  You were all contacted to save these dates on your 
calendars.  Both Cliff and I think this is an important opportunity for the 
business units to get together to discuss strategies and opportunities. We 
encourage you to attend for both days.

The goals of the offsite include:
 a) to discuss strategies and commercial opportunities necessary to meet our 
financial targets for 2000;
 b) to discuss resource requirements and organizational issues;
 and c) to provide an open forum to facilitate discussion and team building 
amongst the businesses.

Each business unit will have one hour to present its strategies and 
opportunities.  Specifically, we are asking the origination groups to 
describe their current strategy, detail the top 5 commercial 
deals/opportuntities for 2000 and to discuss any resource or organizational 
issues facing the unit.  Each trading organization will be asked to give a 
short market overview of their markets, identify three market or trading 
opportunities and discuss any resource or organizational issues facing that 
group.  Please submit your presentations to Kay Chapman no later than April 
28, 2000.  The agenda is quite agressive but we wanted to give everyone an 
opportunity to discuss their business.

A more detailed agenda and locations/times will follow shortly.

Palo Verde 3 began their refueling outage this past weekend.  During

(leaks) in their reactor coolant system.  One was at a temperature detector,
the other was at the pressurizer.  The refueling outage had been expected to
last about a month (restart 10/30/01).  These cracks may delay restart due
to very heightened NRC concern about this kind of cracking.  We will keep

Guys, I assume that you will have a complete headcount and a revised 2001 
expense/revenue/capital budget available in the next week or so.  I would 
also like to know what your HR plan might be given these changes.  David 
Oxley will the help with the HR issues and Wes Colwell with the budget issues.

No turning back gentlemen.  I look forward to great success in the next year.

Frevert, Whalley, Lavo and myself are sitting down to discuss Electrobolt on 
Tuesday morning - subject to that meeting we have approval to go ahead from 
Skilling.

Subject: Organizational Changes

On November 8, the Office of the Chairman, issued an important communication, 
announcing significant organizational changes in Enron's worldwide 
operations. The purpose of this memo is to share with you the decisions that 
are underway to restructure  Enron,s operations in South America.  The basic 
organizational framework has been set. 

As you know, Diomedes Christodoulou and Jim Bannantine will be assuming new 
responsibilities within Enron. Replacing them will be Orlando Gonzalez and 
Joe Kishkill, who will become the Co-Presidents of South America, reporting 
to Dave Delainey and John Lavorato.  They will share overall responsibility; 
however, Orlando,s focus will be on direct sales origination, 
commercial/government relationships and regulatory issues.  Joe,s focus will 
be on wholesale origination, financial and operating performance and overall 
country management.  In addition, Orlando will continue as President and CEO 
of Elektro until its ultimate sale.

The existing, large integrated asset base in South America (excluding 
Elektro) will be managed and operated by Rebecca McDonald and Jim Hughes in 
Enron Global Assets, which is part of Enron Wholesale Services under Mark 
Frevert. Ultimately, there will be very close coordination in both Brazil and 
Argentina between Enron Americas and Enron Global Assets to ensure that our 
reputation in South America is protected, our asset positions are being 
managed prudently and that commercial opportunities surrounding these assets 
are pursued.

The remaining natural gas and electrical commercial activities in South 
America will be organized around the highly successful North American network 
business model.  This model employs people, market making, physical 
commodities, capital and assets to provide reliable, flexible and high-value 
products to our customers.  It is people and intellectual capital based and 
enjoys high rates of return on invested capital.

In the interest of pursuing this strategy, the following teams will report to 
Joe and Orlando:
 
The Commercial Origination team will be lead by Brett Wiggs.  The team will  
focus on covering South American markets, primarily Brazilian and Argentine 
natural gas and electricity, with the following goals:

? Generating new, innovative, reliable and high value products and services 
needed by the market by utilizing our commodity, asset and capital 
capabilities;
? Providing those products and services across South America and across the 
value chain, including wholesale and retail, based upon the highest value 
opportunity;
? Finding structural value arbitrages in the South American market and move 
quickly to capitalize;
? Assisting the Risk Management and Trading organization in managing the 
overall risk of the organization;
? Managing all new power and asset development opportunities in South America 
consistent with this strategy, and
? Providing the Risk Management and Trading organization information and deal 
flow.

The Commercial Origination team will consist of a diverse group of people who 
work as a single team which bring the required skills including commodity, 
capital, regulatory, asset, development, market, structuring, deal execution, 
finance and country knowledge necessary to reach our goals. 

The Trading and Risk Management team will be headed by Remi Collonges.  The 
team will continue to develop pricing information and manage the price book 
for the relevant energy markets in support of the wholesale and direct sales 
efforts.  Additionally, the team will work toward implementation of actively 
trading South American energy commodities.  This group will be responsible 
for managing Enron South America,s overall risk and will have a direct 
reporting relationship with John Lavorato in his role as head of the Americas 
risk activities.

The Argentine effort will be integrated into the overall South American 
Commercial Origination and Trading and Risk Management groups; however, we 
will continue to maintain an Argentine office headed by Michael Guerriero.  

The goal of the reorganization is to create a flat team oriented organization 
that is very market and commercially focused.  The following support 
functions will assist the overall business objectives of the commercial team 
and will report into Joe and Orlando, plus into their line functions in 
Houston.  The overall goal is to ensure that the South American business 
units have an adequate support organization to evaluate opportunities, as 
well as manage day-to-day business and risk.  Otherwise, the Houston 
infrastructure will provide resources as needed to manage peak requirements 
in South America, not unlike other businesses in Enron Americas.

These groups include:

The Government Affairs team, which will be headed by Sergio Assad, will 
manage the relationships with the relevant regulatory agencies as well as 
governmental ministries.  The primary regulatory goal will be to facilitate, 
in the near term, substantive changes to the regulatory rules to allow a 
functioning wholesale traded market in Brazil and Argentina. Sergio will 
assume his responsibilities upon completion of the Elektro sale.  During this 
interim period, Jose Bestard will continue to be in charge of the regulatory 
function.  Once Sergio makes the transition, he will also report to Rick 
Shapiro in Enron Government Affairs.

The Finance team will be headed by Britaldo Soares.  The team will manage the 
interface with Enron Global Finance.  Britaldo will transition from his 
current duties at Elektro upon completion of the Elektro sale.  Britaldo will 
also report to Joe Deffner in Enron Global Finance.  Rob Gay will be 
assisting Britaldo during the transition, while continuing his work on the 
Cuiaba project.

The Legal team, which will be lead by Randy Young, as general counsel, and 
John Novak, as deputy general counsel, will manage South America,s legal 
requirements.  Randy and John will also report to Mark Haedicke in Enron 
Wholesale Services - Legal Department.

Miguel Padron will become Chief of Staff.  Human Resources, Information 
Technology, Treasury, Accounting & Reporting, as well as Administration will 
report to Miguel.  This will bring focus to essential, but non-commercial 
functions, as well as more efficiently manage key matrix reporting 
relationships with Enron.  Miguel will also report to David Oxley in Enron 
Wholesale Services ) Human Resources and Wes Colwell in Enron Wholesale 
Services ) Business Analysis and Reporting.

These changes are consistent with Enron's evolving business strategy and 
reflect our continuing commitment to grow the company by maximizing our 
financial and intellectual capital.  However, in line with the new 
organizational structure and the near term potential for business in the 
region, further budget reductions will be necessary.  People directly 
affected will be notified shortly.
 
Enron is committed to continue the successful implementation of its 
businesses in South America.  We believe that as the markets develop, we are 
uniquely positioned to leverage Enron,s core capabilities and create 
shareholder value.

Subject: Heartland Industrial Partners

Dave, in May 2000 Enron North America committed to invest up to $30 million 
in Heartland Industrial Partners L.P., a private equity fund.  The terms of 
the fund investment are fairly typical (and not particularly exciting for a 
limited partner such as we).  The deal was "sold" on the basis of ENA getting 
exclusive rights to provide energy management services to companies owned by 
the fund if these were cost effective.  The claimed benefits for the energy 
management tie were calculated at $20 - 50 million.  The deal was originated 
by Brad Dunn who now is in EIM.   Ownership of this commitment had been 
assigned to Jim Ajello.

The kinds of energy management services associated with this deal are now 
provided by EES.  While they are happy to exploit any opportunity, their 
business plan does not contemplate investment substantial capital in this 
kind of deal.  In short, they have no interest in picking up the commitment 
(and capital employed) via an intercompany transfer.

Private equity funds such as this are highly illiquid by design and the 
normal investment cycle is at least 5 - 7 years.  The Heartland partnership 
has a 10-year life,  Enron did negotiate the right to sell its LP interest 
after 3 years.  As a practical matter, that right guarantees neither a fair 
price or even a market.

There is no logical home for this investment that I know of in ENA except in 
my portfolio.  Question: is this an ENA responsibility or would it move to 
EIM's balance sheet?  If we (ENA) have no choice but to retain the 
investment, my group will take responsibility for it and do our best to 
monetize funds invested to-date (about $6 million) and sell the remaining 
commitment.  Since the fund itself is still marketing limited partnership 
interests, however, it will be extremely difficult to get out of our 
investment/commitment in the foreseeable future.  Under any circumstances 
finding a buyer will be time-consuming and expensive.  (This is a poster 
child for "patient" investment capital).

I want to ensure that you are aware of the situation in case your view is 
that the obligation should be transferred to EIM which I believe has assumed 
the charter of the ENA group that formerly managed this investment.  Dick.

John, thanks for the update. I sat down with John Lavorato and Dana Davis 
this morning to review the deal and get John's approval under the current 
terms. He has approved the deal in it's current form however, to the extent 
that we have any material change in the terms I'll need to be sure he's OK 
with the changes in advance of any binding committment with Central Maine. 
This is definitely a deal we want to do and given the anticipated 
acceleration in the negotiations and possible execution, we need to be sure 
that we're able to react and transact quickly. Dana Davis is obviously on 
point for all pricing. For all others who have involvement here - please 
ensure that you're on board with your piece of the deal as is, and available 
to focus on any negotiated changes that may come up over the next couple of 
days. Berney Aucoin will be on point for coordinating and managing all 
internal pricing, approvals, etc., so be sure that Bernie can get ahold of 
you if he needs to.  

Also, for the DASH signatures, why don't you move both Kevin and I to 
"Regional Management" and let Ader and Davis sign for Origination and 
Trading. 

Thanks and good luck!

Subject: Draft DASH for CMP Standard Offer Deal

All:

As some of you may be aware, we are in the process of negotiating with 
Central Maine Power Company regarding the assumption of a portion of their 
wholesale obligations associated with their Standard Offer Service load in 
the State of Maine, covering at least March 1, 2001 - Feb 28, 2002.   We are 
currently in the process of negotiating a contract and transaction terms.  
They are simultaneously discussing same with other suppliers.  At this point, 
there are a number of outstanding items (including numerous contract items 
and credit arrangements).  However, we expect that the pace of the 
negotiation process will be very quick over the next 1-3 days.   As an 
example of how quickly things might move, CMP has indicated that the Maine 
PUC is poised to hold deliberations and approve CMP's signing of a contract 
within 24 hours of CMP/Enron agreement on contract terms (with updated firm 
pricing to be supplied just prior to PUC deliberations and held open for 
about 2-3 hours).

Key members of our negotiating team on this deal are as follows:

Origination/Marketing:  John Llodra, George Wood
Legal:  Janice Moore
Regulatory/Governmental:  Daniel Allegretti
Commodity Structuring:  Jim Meyn, Zach Sampson
Credit:  Edward Sacks, Tracy Ngo

Attached below is a draft of the DASH for this prospective deal.  Items 
subject to change or still under negotiation are noted.   While this DASH is 
prepared assuming we obtain a multi-year extension swaption, there is a 
chance it may end up being a single year deal for the period Mar 1, 01- Feb 
28, 02.   My intent in sending the DASH at this time is to familiarize you 
all with the aspects of the deal at this point in time, to enable us to move 
quickly to get internal approvals in the event we reach final agreement with 
CMP over the next couple of days.  Once agreement is reached with CMP on 
outstanding items, a revised DASH will be circulated.  Please feel free to 
call me at 978-449-9936, or Jim Meyn/Berney Aucoin in structuring (5-3223, 
3-4784) if you have any questions on the commercial structure or valuation to 
date.  Thanks.

Regards
John

Thanks for the message.  I appreciate your responses to my August 8 memo and 
agree that the deal you are currently proposing looks alot closer to the deal 
we had been discussing with TXU.  As far as negotiating approach is 
concerned, my intention was not to retrade our deal, but frankly your team's 
approach up until your recent response certainly suggested that you were.  As 
we considered our options, we used the time to scrub our economics and as I 
think Jim Noles told you, have discovered that our economics have 
deteriorated (significantly).  Not your fault/problem, but a real issue for 
me.  I have my people looking at the deal again to see if we can offer some 
creative suggestions to improve the deal for us (without killing you).  At 
the end of the day, I want to do this deal; but I can't do an uneconomic 
deal. By the way, the other parties who signed up with TXU all did so in the 
$26-27.5 range (energy and RECs), suggesting that our deal for you is way 
under market.  I am committed to pushing hard to get this deal done!  Let's 
talk later this week once my team hooks up with yours to see if we have a way 
forward.  Adam

Subject: Indian Mesa

Adam, I believe that we have formally responded to all your issues as per 
your memo to me of August 8, 2000. In all or almost all cases, we have 
accepted your position.  The agreement should look and behave very closely to 
what you would have signed with the competing utility. In addition, ENA is 
paying a higher price, sharing credits and have voluntarily increased the 
term to twelve years from ten.

I do not understand what is holding up completing this transaction other than 
a complete re-trade on the original transaction. I hope this is not the 
case.  The ENA team worked hard to facilitate this transaction for Enron 
Wind.  In fact, we were originally solicited by Enron Wind to help build the 
merchant wind market and we had to coax Enron Wind to do this transaction 
with ENA versus TXU.

I look forward to finding a solution to this current impasse.

Regards
Delainey

As most people are aware, there are a variety of proceedings and investigations pertaining to the western wholesale power markets.  More than 50 market participants are involved in litigation on both the state and federal level.  We have no reason to believe that Enron has been singled out in any of these investigations.  

Each person in the Portland office needs to be aware of and comply with our data retention policies.  These policies are not new.  I have previously sent out e-mails delineating our policy.  This e-mail simply serves as a reminder.  

If you have any questions or concerns please let me know.


The purpose of this message is to update employees on the
status of the California Attorney General's order regarding the preservation
of business information.  Please NOTE THE IMPORTANT POLICIES DESCRIBED
BELOW.

Please continue to ahdere to the following business information retention policies:

(1) PERSONAL EMAIL: can be kept, discarded,
etc. at will.

(2) BUSINESS EMAIL: do not delete any
business email sent or received for 24 hours.  This 24 hour delay will allow
the network to save a backup copy of the email.  After 24 hours, BUSINESS
EMAIL may be kept, discarded, etc. at will.

(3) WORD PROCESSING FILES OR FILE FRAGMENTS:
do not delete any SAVED FILE or any FILE FRAGMENT.  This policy covers any
FILE or FILE FRAGMENT that you have saved on your hard disk or the network.

(4) DATABASES: do not delete any information
in DATABASES.

(5) EXCEL SPREADSHEETS: do not delete any
information in EXCEL SPREADSHEETS.

(6) CALENDARS OR SCHEDULING PROGRAMS: do not
delete any information.

(7) OTHER ELECTRONIC DATA: do not delete any
OTHER ELECTRONIC DATA.

(8) HARD DRIVE CAPACITY: in the event that
you run out of disk space on your personal computer, you may copy files to
the network (where they will be backed up), then delete the files from your
personal computer to create the work space you need.  DO NOT DELETE ANY FILE
BEFORE YOU HAVE COPIED IT TO THE NETWORK.


In our negotiations we have discovered no
reason to believe that Enron has been singled out for investigation by the
Attorney General.  We will update you as we learn more.

Thanks for your help in this matter.

Tim Belden

More than 50 market participants are involved in litigation on both the state and federal level.  We have no reason to believe that Enron has been singled out in any of these investigations.  

Each person in the Portland office needs to be aware of and comply with our data retention policies.  These policies are not new.  I have previously sent out e-mails delineating our policy.  This e-mail simply serves as a reminder.  

If you have any questions or concerns please let me know.


The purpose of this message is to update employees on the
status of the California Attorney General's order regarding the preservation
of business information.  Please NOTE THE IMPORTANT POLICIES DESCRIBED
BELOW.

Please continue to ahdere to the following business information retention policies:

(1) PERSONAL EMAIL: can be kept, discarded,
etc. at will.

(2) BUSINESS EMAIL: do not delete any
business email sent or received for 24 hours.  This 24 hour delay will allow
the network to save a backup copy of the email.  After 24 hours, BUSINESS
EMAIL may be kept, discarded, etc. at will.

(3) WORD PROCESSING FILES OR FILE FRAGMENTS:
do not delete any SAVED FILE or any FILE FRAGMENT.  This policy covers any
FILE or FILE FRAGMENT that you have saved on your hard disk or the network.

(4) DATABASES: do not delete any information
in DATABASES.

(5) EXCEL SPREADSHEETS: do not delete any
information in EXCEL SPREADSHEETS.

(6) CALENDARS OR SCHEDULING PROGRAMS: do not
delete any information.

(7) OTHER ELECTRONIC DATA: do not delete any
OTHER ELECTRONIC DATA.

(8) HARD DRIVE CAPACITY: in the event that
you run out of disk space on your personal computer, you may copy files to
the network (where they will be backed up), then delete the files from your
personal computer to create the work space you need.  DO NOT DELETE ANY FILE
BEFORE YOU HAVE COPIED IT TO THE NETWORK.


In our negotiations we have discovered no
reason to believe that Enron has been singled out for investigation by the
Attorney General.  We will update you as we learn more.

Thanks for your help in this matter.

Tim Belden

Subject: References for ENA

ENA has asked for EES customer references.  ENA is currently working with 
National Gypsum and National Gypsum has asked for two references. They would 
prefer manufacturers that have over 10% of their cost of goods sold as energy 
and have DSM projects completed at their facilities.  ENA has solicited my 
support in getting these references because when they asked EES Sales, they 
found them not to be overly cooperative with supplying names out of fear that 
ENA may burn out EES customers before EES Sales can use them.  

Since EES customers fall under Jeff's pervue, I need your help in getting the 
go-ahead to approach the account managers to set this up.  My suggestions 
would be World Color Press, Package Ice, Polaroid, or Ocean Spray.  Suiza 
would be a good choice if we could get the right person.  

ENA has asked me to get this information to them as soon as possible since 
the deal is on hold until they get the references.

Thanks,

Kurt

We realize that many people are out today due to the Veteran's Day holiday (no cash trading or scheduling today).  We will have another meeting tomorrow morning for people who were unable to make it to meetings this morning.  We will announce the time and place of that meeting soon.

We recognize that the last couple of weeks have been unsettling for many people.  Our goal over the next couple of days is to get back to business as usual.  There are no mandatory layoffs planned for this office.  Chris and I met with John Lavorato, Louise Kitchen, and Greg Whalley over the weekend.  Their marching orders were clear -- go back to Portland and get back to work!  As we mentioned in the all-employee meeting a few weeks ago, this office has a reasonable cost structure and is very profitable.

As we continue to define goals/objectives and coverage staffing in alignment

with Enbridge, Consumers and Union due to mid-market/trading coverage 
previously being at the central desk.  I understand there is history to this

Body:
No action needed by either of you.  You can ignore this if you like.  The issue is really complicated and I've tried to summarize it.  I'm not sure how closely the two of you have been tracking activities at FERC.  We had an interim victory late last week on the chargeback issue.  

As Edison and Pacific Gas were defaulting on PX and ISO payments in January and February, the PX attempted to invoke the charge back section of its tariff.  This had several strange outcomes.  First, the PX attempted to recover the short payments by Edison for December activity by charging PX market participants based on a three month rolling average of gross sales.  If the PX owed a supplier money, they simply short-payed by the prorata amount.  If the market participant owed the PX money, the PX added it to the participants bill.  This created a series of short pays and chargebacks.  If a market participant who received a chargeback bill didn't pay (e.g., PG&E for SCE's December PX activity), the PX would then allocate that amount (via short pays and chargebacks) to other participants.  This iterative process would continue until credit-worthy participants shouldered the burden.  The PX attempted to us an equally bizarre method to allocate defaults by the utilities on their ISO RT energy bill (the PX is the Schedule Coordinator for the utilities and handles payments to the ISO for RT energy on behalf of the utilities).  Rather than shortpaying suppliers to the ISO for defaults by the utilities on RT energy charges, the PX attempted to collect this money from its participants in order to pay the ISO -- that is sellers into the PX Day Ahead market were supposed to pay SCE's and PG&E's RT ISO bill.  This was done via a chargeback.  This led to our "last man standing" theory, whereby the PX would iteritively chargebacks until a few credit-worthy entities were stuck with PG&E and SCE's defaults in both the PX and ISO markets.

FERC granted market participants some relief on Friday.  They directed the PX to (1) rescind all chargebacks and (2) refrain from taking any future chargebacks.  They found "the chargeback provision in the PX tariff was not designed to address default of this magnitude and, thus, its application in these circumstances is unjust and unreasonable."  This is not the last word on this matter.  There are a variety of state court cases that impact this, and, of course the bankruptcy judge will weigh in as well.  However, this is a solid victory for us as FERC has sided with us rather than the PX with respect to interpreting the PX tariff for defaults.

that lays out a bunch of facts and introduces a theory for pricing storable 
commodities.  I think that my analysis highlights the major shortcomings for 
the Kahn/Joskow paper and the approach employed by the Department of Market 
Analysis.  My presentation has nothing to do with Enron.  I can defer any 
questions about generators to Gary Ackerman.  I can politely dismiss 
questions about Enron, its trading activities, or profitability.  I still 
could use some help on the just and reasonable price questions.  Attached 
below are the draft power point slides that I will use in the presentation as 
well as a word document with a draft script of the speech.  Please review and

you a call to discuss further.

Couple of points, I would hope you would share with your group on Monday:

 - the European retail business is an important and strategic focus for Enron 
and EES;
 - it encompases a material part of EES's and Enron Europes margin plan for 
2001 - so execution and most probably over performance is key in 2001;
 - it was birthplace of one of the key EES distribution platforms that needs 
to be migrated to North America - Enron Direct and the ITOL structure (for 
the large industrial customer);
 - the European business IS one of the largest growth opportunities going 
forward for EES and EES management will recognize, resource and reward that 
effort;
 - I am very involved in business strategy, execution and deals;
 - I believe in open communication, performance and high performance teams - 
no bullshit politics;
 - I recognize and reward performance, thinking, execution and leadership;
 - I flourish in a culture of ideas, fast action and success;
 - and I will be visiting London to meet everyone probably late February 
early March.

PS - I am already a citizen of the Commonwealth.

Talk to you soon!!

Subject: EES Europe - Outsourcing Reorganisation

Introduction

EES has been operating in Europe since late 1999 and in that time a lot of 
progress has been made.  The teams who have worked on Outsourcing in Europe 
have learnt a tremendous amount over the last year.  We now have a much 
clearer idea of what should work today in the different jurisdictions that 
comprise Europe and those elements of our offering with which customers are 
most comfortable.

The phenomenally strong financial performance in 2000 of Enron Direct and 
ETOL graphically demonstrate the future potential in Europe for a broad 
retail energy business.  With Enron's retail energy presence in Europe firmly 
established, we are restructuring our Outsourcing product offering and the 
organisation to develop and deliver it, so that we broaden our activities and 
successfully grow our earnings in line with shareholder expectations.

We now have a renewed focus in 2001.  The emphasis will be to work on only 
the largest deals (by energy commodity spend) in those markets where we 
already have a robust wholesale energy business and there is regulated and 
economic third party access to retail power distribution systems.  The main 
thrust of our offering will be commodity and Demand Side Management (DSM) 
projects and our associated price risk management capabilities.  Commodity is 
Enron's core competence and one where Enron should be in a position to 
generate sizeable gross margin at closure.  DSM projects are also important 
as they will deliver gross margin and are what differentiate us from the 
commodity competition.  We will be focussing on shorter project lead times at 
the front of a deal to ensure that we get to closure promptly - we need to 
see 80% of the value in 20% of the time.  Whilst we retain an understanding 
of O&M, this will not form part of our core offering and we will only 
consider involvement in an O&M capacity on attractive margin transactions 
where it is essential to the customer.  As the business develops it is likely 
that, to some extent, we will build the necessary O&M delivery capability to 
enhance the product offering in the future.

In those markets where we have limited wholesale capability or the third 
party access to power distribution systems is not feasible in a retail 
context, we will build and develop Utility Representation Services (URS) in 
conjunction with a DSM project offering.  This knowledge based business will 
allow us to develop retail customer networks in advance of economic system 
access and also provide valuable market information back to the wholesale 
business.  URS is ERPAG's core business and gives us a tremendous platform to 
create a pan European URS competence.

Expertise in Supply Side Management has increasingly become an issue for the 
origination team in EES Europe as we have begun to get into material deal 
development.  Whilst it is vital that we remain totally coordinated with the 
wholesale business for price risk management services, there will be a 
renewed emphasis within EES Europe to develop those commodity skills that do 
not reside in the wholesale business to allow us to promptly and effectively 
price and structure retail commodity transactions to the delivery point.

Given the renewed focus outlined above, we have taken the opportunity to 
streamline the Account Delivery and Management team, typically redeploying 
staff where they can immediately support the development of new business for 
EES Europe.  Effective Account Management remains a key capability for EES 
and as we close deals with customers we will review our staffing need in this 
area.

Organisation

After eighteen months working on establishing the outsourcing business in 
Europe, Ron Bertasi has decided to transition back to the US during the first 
half of 2001.  In the short term he will complete the Trillium property deal 
and ensure that the energy and property deals are both successfully 
launched.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank Ron, on behalf of 
everyone in Europe, for all his hard work over the last eighteen months in 
establishing the European Outsourcing business and in particular his 
leadership on the Trillium deal which represents a substantial landmark for 
the business.

Stuart Rexrode is now head of European Energy Services Outsourcing.  Stuart 
will continue in a customer facing capacity as a lead originator, whilst 
ensuring that all of the dimensions that comprise the Outsourcing team remain 
appropriately focussed.  Bob Manasse will head up the origination team and 
ensure that the deal pipeline remains full of substantial good quality 
prospects.

Hala Tayyarah has been promoted to Manager within the Commodity team and will 
provide commodity pricing support to the origination team.  Hala will report 
to Peter Redpath until such time as a head of Supply Side Management is 
appointed.

Reporting to Peter Redpath, Peter Ramgolam will lead a new activity, 
Transaction Economics, supporting Origination by developing cashflow models 
to determine deal economics, identify improvements to structures to optimise 
value and capture transactions for risk management purposes.

Also reporting to Peter Redpath, John Parker will lead the implementation of 
a Position Management activity.

The attached organisation charts show these changes in the revised structure 
of EES Europe which is effective immediately.  Whilst these charts are 
relatively self explanatory for the levels shown, there will be detailed 
discussions over the next day or so to explain what the changes mean for 
individuals.  Where boxes are labelled TBA, we hope to make appointments in 
the near future.

At 10.30am on Monday 12th February we shall be holding a one hour EES-Europe 
all employee meeting in the Auditorium in place of the usual weekly staff 
meeting.  At this session we will talk about the 2001 Earnings Plan and 
provide clarity on the deal process for Outsourcing and the reasoning behind 
it.  Also, it will be an opportunity for you to raise any questions you may 
have.  I look forward to seeing you there.

Matthew

Subject: NSTAR 6-month Transaction


I would like to personally thank and congratulate everyone involved in 
helping ENA bring closure to the NSTAR wholesale power transaction.  Any 
transaction of this nature requires support from many people and I appreciate 
everyone's hard work in making this transaction a reality.  In addition, I 
believe ENA is well positioned for a longer term transaction with NSTAR.   I 
would encourage John Llodra and Jeff Ader to work closely together to create 
the best value proposition for Enron on the long term deal.
Strict Confidentiality language is embedded in the 6-month NSTAR transaction, 
and it is extremely important that everyone involved honors the zero 
tolerance nature of this Confidentiality provision.  The bottom line is that 
we cannot disclose anything about this deal to any third partiies, including 
the mere existence of the deal.   If we do not respect this provision fully, 
we will jeapordize our goodwill with the customer and thus our ability to 
move forward with a longer term transaction.  In addtion, there could be 
negative legal ramnifications.

Thanks again for a job well done.  If I missed anyone who was involved in the 
transaction, please forward this e-mail to those individuals.

the market has fallen and is still falling precipitously.  for example, power

implementing price caps now would actually be harmful.  peaking units make no 
money.  we are likely to return to a more normal market, particularly after 
the summer, if we aren't there already.  with the forward curve crashing the

Tim --

What are your current thoughts on wholesale hard price caps for the entire 
West?  

First, the politics are clearly moving toward some compromise with the 
Democrat takeover in the Senate and the "at-risk" Republicans in the House 
(California delegation).  I think that the Administration is struggling for 
some "solution".

Second, given FERC's order, it appears that for many hours caps are already 
in place.

Third, with market prices moving lower, this may want be a non-event.

Finally, I would think that a region-wide solution is simple to understand 
and administer.

Please let me know your thoughts.  I don't know that Enron would ever 
publically endorse such a proposal, but we may signal that we aren't opposed?

below.

CC: Olson, Frevert, McMahon, Bowen, McConnell, Shankman
From: ENA OTC

Re: Confidential - New Procedures to be introduced by ENA OTC for Exec 
Employment Agreements and Hiring of Commercial Staff Below VP into ENA

Effective immediately we have asked the ENA HR department to implement the 
following changes to procedures to assist us in managing these two very 
important processes, more consistently and effectively:

Hiring of all Commercial Managers or Directors (VP process will remain as is)
Business Unit leads and MD's will remain responsible for developing and 
pursuing speculative talent for their groups and, within their budgets, will 
also remain responsible for managing their overall headcount.
The HR department will continue to support this effort by focusing on 
providing each of you with a flow of speculative resumes which you should 
spend time each week reviewing and providing feedback on so that this 
pipeline can be refined and better targeted.
The interviewing process for all Commercial Managers and Directors should be 
very rigorous and should include at least 2 interviews by VP's in addition to 
the sponsoring Business Unit lead plus a minimum of 3 senior individuals 
within the sponsoring group (ie total of 6 in most cases).
Effective immediately, once the sponsoring group lead has completed their 
interviewing process and would like to extend an offer of employment, the 
candidate must be interviewed by the ENA OTC, before an offer of employment 
will be released by the HR department. No candidates should be referred to 
the ENA OTC for interview before the sponsoring group has concluded and 
resolved  ALL issues surrounding whether they themselves wish to hire the 
candidate.
Since any offer of employment at Commercial Manager or Director will now be 
contingent upon approval by the ENA OTC, candidates expectations should be 
managed to ensure they appreciate this final interview will be necessary.
John Lavorato has agreed to conduct the majority of these interviews, which 
will be co-ordinated via your HR representative. Where the candidate is out 
of town, these will be conducted via telephone.

Executive Employment Agreement Process for Commercial Staff
Effective immediately, the process for identifying and negotiating Executive 
Employment Agreements for Commercial staff at ENA will be modified as follows:
For all Commercial staff, the sponsoring Business Unit lead or Managing 
Director, should agree in principle the need for a contract with John 
Lavorato of the ENA OTC. This request should be by either email or voicemail 
and should include the following information: (1) Name, (2) Level (3) 
Business focus and/or project (4) Their latest 2 PRC results (5) The reason 
or justification for offering them a contract.
In any other instance (ie non-commercial employees), the sponsoring BU lead 
or MD should contact David Oxley, Wholesale Group VP for HR for direction.
Once the ENA OTC has approved in principle the negotiation of a contract, 
your HR representative listed below will assist you in preparing draft 
financial terms on the familiar contract request form.
Before a draft contract will be prepared by the ENA legal team, the financial 
terms (the request form in other words) must be approved by John Lavorato in 
the ENA OTC. In the event of a tight deadline, John may approve the two steps 
described here at 1 and 4 simultaneously by email or voicemail.
Any subsequent changes in terms must also be approved by the ENA OTC before a 
fresh draft will be produced.

The following HR Representatives will assist you with these new procedures:

Power Trading  - Kim Melodick  57273
Gas Trading  - Jeanie Slone  53847

Here are my thoughts so far:

1.  Initial Legal Team -- Jeff Hodge, Jim Keller, Carol St. Clair, Aaron 
Rothwarg

2.  Spot Check the Forms -- over the next week

3.  Conform Forms to ENA Forms -- over next two months

4.  Develop Form Approval Process -- dual approvals by EES and ENA

5.  Develop Deal Approval Process -- deals above a certain size (or material 
variations from the form) would require concurrent EWS approval

6.  Request List of Major Contract Concerns from Traders -- items that cannot 
be hedged

I did, however, gleen from him that he and his investors already own the 50 
buildings (not in the process of buying them as I originally thought) and 
have +/- 100 additional properties they manage.

I'm stepping out of the middle of this one now unless there is anything

Sherri,

We would be quite interested in looking into this further.  We are currently 
working with quite a few companies to sell power under 3-5 year contract 
terms.  The customers range from large office bldgs (>2Mw and connected to 
EHV grid) to large industrials (several hundred Mw).  We are also making some 
real progress with the real estate companies and department stores to provide 
power to a number of their facilities across Japan.  There are a number of 
other initiatives where we would take an industrials self generation off 
balance sheet, upgrade facility, etc to give us access to power.  In one case 
we are progressing with a company that has 600 Mw inside the fence.

Let me know how you would like to progress.  As a point of interest, a 
particular discount product that we are offering is fully described on our 
biligual website (www.enron.co.jp).  This has been very successful for us.

Gentlemen,

You will receive a phone call from Peter Wachtell sometime over the next 
week.  I spoke to his father last night at a dinner party; Peter is putting 
together a deal in Tokyo right now to purchase 50 office buildings and manage 
another 100.  He is interested in talking to Enron about energy outsourcing.

I'm assured that this a legitimate deal, but that will be for you to decide!  
Just wanted to give you a heads up in the hopes you will take a few minutes 
to talk to him.

Subject: PRC Rep and Pre-rating meeting

Dave,
I am following up on the voicemail I left you on Thursday October 5th, 
requesting a recommendation for a Director to represent Analysts at the final 
2000 PRC.  Due to promotions and additions to the Associate and Analyst 
Programs, we have an additional slot for the Analyst PRC that we would like 
to fill with an ENA participant.  This will keep the distribution throughout 
the business units equitable.  I understand from Charlene that you have asked 
Janet Dietrich to nominate the PRC Rep.

We would like to finalize this by Friday, October 13th in order to load the 
PEP system and communicate to the A/A pool members.  Please forward your 
choice for ENA representation to me by this date or contact me to discuss.

Also, I know that there have been discussions between Terry Bosien, David 
Oxley, Andrea Yowman and others to schedule ENA's pre-rating meeting prior to 
the final A/A PRC which has been scheduled for December 12th and 13th.  We 
must have the pre-ratings loaded into the PEP system prior to these dates and 
hope they can be final by November 30th.  These results are imperative to a 
successful cross-calibration in the final PRC meeting.  We already have dates 
set for the EES and ESA meetings.  I will be glad to attend the Associate and 
Analyst piece of ENA's PRC meetings to assist in facilitation.  Please advise 
when the ENA pre-rating meeting is scheduled.  Thank you for your cooperation.

Dave:

I would like to put the wheels in motion to investigate the opportunity we 
discussed yesterday.  

Although my initial reaction is that I truely enjoy Portland and my current 
position (it's cold in Canada) and believe I can add real value here over the 
next year or two, the opportunitiy to build help build a business and broaden 
my experience with a move to Toronto is positive.  I need more information to 
feel comfortable making this decision.  So, please advise me as to when I can 
contact Paul DeVries and Rob Milnthorp (and who else I should contact) to get 
into the details..  

Thanks for the opportunity!

I received a memo this morning from Jeff Donahue wanting to set up a meeting 
with you, Ray Bowen, Wes Colwell, Dick Lydecker, Andrea Reed and himself this 
week regarding Hanover Compressor.  I contacted his assistant and told her 
that you would not be in this week.  She will let Jeff know and get back to 
me.  I haven't heard anything more on that yet.  Please let me know if you 
would like to try to call in or if you want to wait until you get back.

Enron's goal is to raise $700,000, and Jeff's personal goal is to raise $50,000.  As of today, we are a little better than half way there.  Won't you consider helping him reach his goal?

Thanks for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing from you tomorrow...

Chris, this sounds good.  It would be helpful for us (the overall power 
business) to have a common set of metrics and reports that evaluate the 
effectiveness and importance of the mid market effort.  I think we all 
believe this is an important skill or capability that needs to measured and 
rewarded.

Key metrics may include: a)coverage metrics against target customers (ie) 
customer contact ;b) forward deal flow or hot list; c)completed transactions 
and origination; and d) EOL customer sign-ons and deal flow.

I look forward to sitting down to discuss.

I spoke with Ed Baughman about the reports he is generating to measure Middle 
Market Group "coverage" in the East.  I also met with Greg Wolfe. and Tim B. 
to get their feedback as to how the East Desk Middle Market Reports reports 
should be used/modified for the West.  As a result of these discussions, 
along with discussions with others in the Middle Market Group, effective 
October 1, we will begin to more systematically measure certain behaviors, 
such as customer telephone calls, in addition to origination.  By focusing on 
behaviors, and not simply results, our hope is to expand the pool of 
customers and information and improve our marketing effort.  I will be 
working with Ed to try to standarize the approach within EPMI.

It is my understanding that you will be in Portland for a QBR toward the end 
of October.  I look forward to reviewing our plans for coverage metrics and 
our first results with you then.  

Let me know if you want to discuss this approach prior to your visit.  

Thanks!

Guys, I appreciate the quality work and deal flow that you are generating.  
In an effort to measure and reward performance from our middle market groups 
we have attempted to come up with several standardized reports to be issued 
monthly and to be reviewed at the QBR.  I am a strong believer in that what 
is measured and rewarded gets done.  As well, the middle market capability is 
crucial to the continued growth of our business; therefore, reporting metrics 
which define high performance will ensure great deal makers get rewarded and 
that  you will be able to attract high quality talent into the mid market 
groups.  Baughman and Presto have created a number of reports and metrics for 
the East Power group, I would like you to take a look and let me know how 
they should be changed to reflect the business in the West.  Upon agreement 
on the metrics, I would like issue these reports on a monthly basis.

Tammy Sheppherd will get you a copy of the reports/metrics utilized in the 
East.

Dave/John:

As you know, EPMI West recently has closed numerous longer-dated transactions 
(through 2002 and beyond) with munis and other direct counterparties (not 
marketers).  Several of these resulted due to close coordination between the 
Originator from Chris Calger's Group, the Middle Marketer and the Trader, 
each with a different role, working out the split of origination to 
everyone's satisfaction. Tim Belden (see below) thought you might be 
interested in the attached spreadsheet listing some of these key deals done 
this year.  

Please let me know if you want further details on the transactions

Attached is a memo regarding a meeting I had with our associates on July 17, 
2000.  Additionally, I met with Celeste Roberts on July 21 and held another 
meeting with the Associates on same date.

The planned dinners with the associates as well as the proactive approach ENA 
is taking with them is the correct course of action.

Subject: ENA Analysts and Associates

I met with 7 associates and 1 analyst  over lunch to discuss the Analyst and 
Associate Program.  The major concern expressed by everyone in the meeting 
was that the program has become a bureaucracy vs a meritocracy.  According to 
the Associates, the program has become inflexible on any issue and the only 
feedback they receive is "go talk to Skilling if you don't like the 
answers".  Another major concern was compensation.  After listening to the 
comments, my conclusion is that there are some problems that need to be 
addressed.  Specific recommendations by this small group include (1) reduce 
amount of time in program before promotion to manager from 18 months to 12 
months, (2) increase Associates involvement in rotation decisions, (3) 
explanations of why the program is structured in a certain way without 
defensive comments of "go talk to Skilling", (4) generally, more of an open 
market approach so that we are using a "carrot vs stick" method to motivate 
behavior.

Let me know about the next meeting to discuss.

Congratulations on the Fuel Cell venture.  I have been trying to get Enron 
interested in this technology for many years.  I am glad someone found the 
right formula.  I would like to discuss applications of Fuel Cell technology 
and where Enron intends to take this product with someone in your 
organization.  The press release did not disclose who the lead promoter in 
your organization is.  Can you direct me to the right person?

Re:  CHAPTER 11 REORGANIZATION
        FINANCIAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS



Many people have questions regarding how Enron will be operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.  This memo addresses the financial reporting requirements Enron will have to its various constituents. 

During the reorganization, the Company will continue its GAAP reporting, with a breakout of pre and post petition liabilities, as well as historical management/operational reporting, consistent with past practices.

In addition, the Company will have an added responsibility to report cash flows to the bankruptcy court and its various constituents.  Specifically, Enron will  be required to report projected cash receipts and cash disbursements by business unit on a weekly basis.  The court and our new debtor-in-possession ("DIP") lenders require a rolling 13 week projection of cash flows plus monthly projections thereafter to obtain a full year of projected cash flows.  The budgeted weekly projections will then be compared to actual results to determine how well each business unit is operating compared to the projections.  The weekly and monthly forecasts will be adjusted each week pursuant to revised or improved information on forecasted cash flows.  Thus this process will be an ongoing one, with constant updating of information to ensure we generate the most accurate reports possible.

The initial weekly and monthly projections will be critical to the determination of the amount that the DIP lenders will be willing to make available to the Company.  In addition, the cash flows for the entities that are included in the bankruptcy proceedings will be utilized by the bankruptcy court and DIP lenders to constantly review and react to the cash flow situation at Enron.  However, all Enron business units (not just ones in bankruptcy) will need to conform to these new requirements, because additional entities are likely to be included in the bankruptcy filing and because it is extremely important for Enron management to be able to see the totality of cash flow requirements for the entire Company.

The weekly cash flow projection project will be overseen by Mike Deville (x 57852) and Greg Adams (x 33887).  In addition, Enron has retained Batchelder & Partners, Inc., a financial advisory firm, to assist us in this and other reorganization efforts.

We will be having a group meeting with the CAO's and/or their designees from the various business units responsible for the cash projections on Wednesday, December 5 at 2:00 PM in the Boardroom on the 50th floor to further explain this process and answer any questions you may have.  We will then be meeting on an individual basis with the business units to discuss specific business unit requirements.

Attached is a template of the financial statement projection format that will be required .  Please review this template in advance of the Wednesday meeting to determine any questions you have on the reporting format.  Obviously the requirements may change, which will require us to reformat and/or obtain additional information on short notification.

Thank you in advance for your cooperation.  We look forward to your attendance on Wednesday.

This memo documents the timing of when we set aside reserves for the Colorado 
Springs Utility deal.  It also documents the history of money flowing into 
and out of Matt Motley's P&L.  This is simply an fyi -- there is no action 
needed from you.

The net effect is that we have a $10 million reserve set up for CSU.  With 
respect to trader performance, $5.2 of that came from when Kevin McGowan 
managed the book (his entire ytd earnings before he moved to coal) and $4.8 
came from Motley's P&L.  I thought it would be useful to record it in a 
quasi-official manner to give Motley comfort that he won't get dinged for an 
old shitty deal that happened before he arrived.

to bringing costs in line with those from last year and, the remainder of the

Subject: Re: 2001 Plan  

I spoke with Bob Hermann this afternoon and, in short, the single biggest 
contributor to the increase in the corporate tax allocation relates to the 
expansion of state and local tax support being provided to our new "business 
verticals" - that is, Enron Global Markets, Enron Industrial Markets and 
Enron Net Works - which expense should be specifically allocated to such 
groups rather than ENA, as is currently the case.  I will follow up with you 
regarding the revised number after I have resolved the allocation issue.  
Best regards.  Steve.

Guys, I noticed that the corporate tax allocation to ENA has more than 
doubled from 2000 forecast to 2001 plan ie) $1,600,000 from $700,000.  Could 
you please explain.  Our goal which is being met in ENA's direct expense 
groups is to remain flat year or year from 2000 to 2001.

That may work -  I don't want to end up with an equity position I just worked 
hard to eliminate. Further, raptor may be a good accounting hedge but if we 
took back JEDI's share at existing marks we would be destroying significant

Dave, I assume you are asking how we hedge the portion of JEDI II investments 
that will come back to us after the restructuring. As any buyout price for 
CALPERS will reflect the state of the assets at closing, I think we are well 
hedged until the closing of the restructuring. We can see if we can reserve 
some Raptor capacity upfront to hege us moving forward from the restructuring 
closin. If this does not answer your question, let me know.    Mike

As I am sure you have read by now, Jeff Skilling has chosen to leave Enron.  Jeff is resigning for personal reasons and his decision is voluntary.  I regret his decision, but I accept and understand it.  I have worked closely with Jeff for more than 15 years, including 11 here at Enron, and have had few, if any, professional relationships that I value more.  I am pleased to say that he has agreed to enter into a consulting arrangement with the company to advise me and the Board of Directors.

I want to assure you that Jeff's departure will in no way affect the relationship that Enron has with Microsoft and more specifically MSN.  I have been briefed on the MSNIA project, by my team,  and they assure me that we are on track to meet your Broadband Internet Access roll-out plans in early October.  I look forward to getting more personally involved with Microsoft to help insure that our ongoing relationship and partnership continues to mature and flourish.

I will contact you in the near future to discuss with you this transition.  In the meantime,  if you have any questions or concerns please do not hesitate to contact my office.

Ken

Janet, he can approve but can't sign as a director. You need to continue to

Effective immediately, I would like Ben Jacoby to have signature authority 
for his team's expense reports as well as all documents whose capital 
commitments are not greater than $250,000. Most documents will be 
confidentiality agreements, exclusivity agreements, permit applications, and

Tim, my understanding is that partnership fee (the $11.0M) has been amortized 
for the last several years and expensed to the Industrial groups (McConville 
and Ondarza).  As you are aware, I sued them for breach.  The settlement 
involved the elimination of all existing transactions between Ft. James and 
Enron including the Wauna and Halsey power contracts.  It is my understanding 
that the benefit of the elimination of those shorts resides in the Portland 
shop.   The elimination of the shorts would not have occurred without the 
lawsuit on the alliance and the settlement I originated.  It seemed logical 
to charge the Portland office with the remaining un-amortized fee of $1.8M as 
a cost of eliminating the shorts for no cost and no future contingent 
liability.

Lets discuss.

Subject: Fort James Amortization

Edith Cross and I looked at the Fort James deal in great detail in early 
1999.  When the deal was closed, west power trading booked an in the money 
position and an offsetting expense of about $11 million.  This money has 
already liquidated from our book.  In fact, I have a copy of the 3/31/97 DPR 
that reflects this liquidation.  At that time, west power trading also paid a 
350k credit reserve, 247k to the finance book, and 1.3 million in 
origination.  

I have also heard about a "partnership" fee that Enron paid to Fort James 
around the same time.  I'm not sure what this fee was and who benefitted from 
it.  It had nothing to do with the west power trading book.

On John's recommendation I called Wes to see if we could figure this out.  
Wes, please give me a call back to discuss.  I think that someone needs to 
look at the actual journal entries from March of 1997 to see why an expense 
of $11 million was deferred.

This is not my problem.  I should not receive this expense.  Until this is 
resolved, I would greatly appreciate it if the writedown of the deferred 
account does not hit west power trading's expenses.

Dave, I had a call from Bradford today and he has Buy's sign-off on 
recognizing U.S. $1.1MM credit exposure reduction as a result of our efforts 
on securing a 3rd charge on Beau's assets (additionally, the 3rd charge 
follows the assets with the Murphy credit upgrade). It is important to 
continue to send originators the right signals re credit mitigation and 
therefore I feel it is imperative that we grant the $1.1MM as origination to 
reward those efforts.

Please advise that you are in agreement, and we will book asap.

Congressional Republicans Draft Energy Bill to Aid the West	
Rep. Joe Barton has spliced together emergency legislation aimed at aiding energy markets in the Western United States via funding for improvements in California's constrained transmission line SP-15 and directing federal disaster officials to prepare for power outages.  The move by Republicans came as Democratic criticism of the Bush administration's response to the California power crisis intensified Wednesday.  Although the bill will not contain the price caps sought by Democrats and a handful of Republicans, Barton said he would allow amendments in support of price controls during committee deliberations.  A list circulated by GOP staff in recent weeks includes a range of ideas such as relaxing environmental rules, subject to a governor's request; increasing federal energy assistance to low-income consumers; firing up mothballed power plants; and directing federal facilities to reduce energy use by 10%.  Additionally, the bill would grant governors the flexibility to allow power plants that have exceeded emissions limits to temporarily keep operating during emergencies.

My latest information on rate increases in California indicates that they will be implemented June 1st.  That means that customers don't see a price signal until June and won't actually see their bill until July.  While I agree with Greg that we may see dramatic demand side response once people see their bills, we have no idea how long it will take people and businesses to adjust their behavior.  I don't really care what positions you guys want to carry.  My only advice is that Greg is short a fairly illiquid product.  If you want to get out right now you would have to pay, at least for some of your position, north of $800/MWh.  In the near term I don't think that it will be easy to get out of this trade.  In the long run, if the market comes off, it will be easy to get out.  

Bottom line --
At the end of the day I think that you may be right, but things look very bullish right now.  I want to make sure that you know that you have already pushed the bounds of liquidity for that product and that you should not expect us to provide liquidity to you in a market that doesn't offer it to us when it is time to get out.

Dave,

Congratulations on an apparently expanded role.  I know you have a lot more 
important issues to deal with at the moment, but will the Enron Americas 
organization result in a change in the role of the technical group and 
resource requirements?   When you have a chance to discuss the implications 
(if any) it might be worth discussing.

Also, on a personal note, if there are new roles associated with the Enron 
Americas org for which I might be qualified, I'd certainly be interested in 
any new opportunities that come about.

Thanks!

Following my note last week please find attached the consolidated peer group mapping for all business units. This mapping is intended to illustrate from a functional view point where each activity was placed at Year End 2000 VP PRC.

We were considering moving to a 3 Peer Group Structure however it as agreed at the last PRC Committee Meeting  to stay with the current structure since the data had been cleaned and everyone felt generally comfortable where most activities had been placed with the exception of just  2 or 3. It was agreed that we should concentrate on resolving these rather than undertaking an organization wide remapping excercise to consolidate to 3 Peer Groups. All functions/activities within the business units should now be reflected on the acttached. 

The actions points from this excercise are:

1	to review and agree the attached mapping 

2    consider and comment on highlighted groups that we have discussed in previous PRC meetings and ask for your comments or objections to moving them 	as indicated on the attachment.

3	invite your comments or questions on any other function that you consider questionable or requiring further explanation.

      Please return your comments to David Oxley by Friday May 25.

      To have this discussion now will save lengthy discussions in the final VP/MD PRC Meetings.  Definitions of the peer groups are also attached for your ease of
      reference.

Another little adder to this concept.  Whether it's wholesale or retail, the offer for this product would come from me -- either by way of Badeer on the wholesale side or Richter on the retail side.  I have no interest in getting short in Silicon Valley.  We don't have transmission to get to this highly congested area.  There are huge risks associated with redefining NP15 into separate zones and large congestion charges associated with getting to the SF penninsula.  This area looks a lot like Zone J in New York.  Not a place you want to be short.

Just a little noise from the field offices...no need to do anything but I thought you should be aware of a little skirmish.  Ader's version is different -he says he only precluded Mike and Laird's involvement after receiving a lot of negativism from them about the EES concept.  Also, he thinks that SVP liked the product offering.   My opinion is that this a wholesale customer/opportunity.

Subject:	EES @ Silicon Valley Power (City of Santa Clara)

Mike & Chris,

I received a phone call from Wayne Ware of Silicon Valley Power ("SVP") this morning.  Apparently, EES met with SVP on Tuesday, July 24th to discuss the sale of power and services through the City to targeted end-use customers on an exclusive basis.

Based upon Wayne's comments, SVP staff's response was not favorable.  Ware offered the following comments:

1)  SVP dismissed the exclusivity element at the outset.
2)  EES's product is perceived to compete directly with SVP's core competency - provision of a fixed priced, load followed product.  SVP indicated that it currently offers term (up to 5 years), fixed priced, load followed power to its customers.  According to Wayne, over 100 MW's (20% of SVP's load) is served this way.
3)  Ware opined that EES does not understand what SVP does or offers its customers.  SVP was perplexed by this given that Wayne Truxillo (the EES rep.) worked for SVP and set up many of the fixed price programs that are currently in place.
4)  SVP views EES's offering as a wholesale product.
5)  SVP also had concerns about EES's reputation and history in California citing the University of California fiasco.  SVP didn't think an EES product would be well received among its customers.

What is disturbing is that Mike and I asked both Truxillo and Ader if we could be included in these meetings or, at a minimum, be given the opportunity to talk with our customers beforehand.  EES excluded us from this process.  Mike indicated that Ader was worried I would sabotage EES's efforts; that I would tell SVP that EES's proposal is a wholesale product replicating SVP's core competency of delivering a fixed priced, load followed product.  Mike and I had a somewhat heated discussion with Ader about their product offering.  Ader characterized the product as retail on the basis that it would be sold one customer at a time and involved load following.  That the product is to be sleeved through SVP (actually sold to SVP for re-sale) and therefore is a wholesale product was dismissed.  Ader also indicated that EES would be offering behind the meter demand related services, which further characterized their product as retail.  What is clear is that EES is searching for physical power sales.  They can offer behind the meter solutions without the help or involvement of SVP.  Their product offering, once the decorations are removed, is a physical power sale.

As was our concern, we will now have to manage this issue, reacting to EES's actions.

Ugh!!!

Laird

Subject: Approval of a Non-Solicitation Provision

Pursuant to an Interoffice Memorandum from Jim Derrick to all Enron Attorneys 
dated October 27, 1999, I am required to seek approval from each of you prior 
to signing off on a non-solicitation agreement which affects Enron North 
America Corp.  This non-solicitation agreement is being required by Niagara 
Mohawk in order to participate in its request for proposal both to outsource 
the management of its supply portfolio and to provide power to meet its 
"Standard Offer Service" load requirements for a term ending 12/31/06.

The proposed non-solicitation language reads as follows:


"The Interested Party [this is defined to be Enron North America Corp.] 
agrees that, without the prior written consent of Niagara Mohawk, the 
Interested Party will not for a period of  eighteen (18) months from the 
effective date of this Confidentiality Agreement directly or indirectly 
solicit for employment any non-union individual who is now employed by 
Niagara Mohawk, its parent, or any of its affiliates or subsidiaries and who 
is identified by the Interested Party as a result of its evaluation or 
otherwise in connection with the Transaction; provided, however, that the 
Interested Party shall not be prohibited from (i) employing any such 
individual who contacts the Interested Party on his or her own initiative and 
without any direct or indirect solicitation by the Interested Party, and (ii) 
conducting generalized solicitations for employees (which solicitations are 
not specifically targeted at employees of Niagara Mohawk, its parent, or any 
of its affiliates or subsidiaries) through the use of media advertisements, 
professional search firms or otherwise."  

Please feel free to contact me at extension 3-7493 if you have any questions 
or comments on the legal side.  If you have questions about the underlying 
commercial transaction, please call either Jeff Ader or Michael Brown.

The Board of the Center for Houston's Future recently committed
resoundingly to the creation of Goals and a Strategic Plan for Houston that
will allow our community to achieve its extraordinary potential over the
next decisive 20 years.  This landmark program, already underway, will be
assisted by many dedicated volunteers from throughout the community.  Led
by Chairman Gene Vaughan, the Center, an affiliate of the Greater Houston
Partnership, is focused on very tough questions:  The world and Houston are
changing rapidly - what will be the new reality in 20 years and beyond?
What do we want Houston to be?  What are the obstacles and trade-offs?
Most of all, what plans, resources, determination and leadership are
necessary now to get Houston to its desirable future?  If you are
interested in what can be done to give Houston a great future worthy of its
past - and particularly if you want to get involved - this is an
outstanding opportunity to discourse with one of the citizens leading the
charge.

Gene Vaughan is chairman and founder of Vaughan, Nelson, Scarborough &
McCullough, L.P., an investment management firm originated in Houston in
1970 whose Investment Counsel and VNSM Trust Company manage securities
portfolios for foundations, endowments, corporations and families.

Within his profession, Mr. Vaughan was founding chairman and governor of
the Association for Investment Management and Research, a past chairman of
the Institute of Chartered Financial Analysts and a past chairman of the
Financial Analysts Federation.  He is chairman and has served as a director
since 1970 of Dreyfus Founders Group of mutual funds (Denver).

Mr. Vaughan has been a trustee of Vanderbilt University (Nashville) since
1972.  He is a director since 1990 and on the Executive Committee of the
Greater Houston Partnership.  He is Chairman of the Center for Houston's
Future whose mission is to help prepare Houston proactively for future
opportunities and challenges.  Mr. Vaughan is a director of the Houston
Grand Opera Association, a trustee of Goodwill Industries and past chairman
of The Houston Forum.  He was founding chairman of Presbyterian School
(early childhood through grade 8) and served as a trustee of St. John's School.

Mr. Vaughan received a B.A. in 1955 from Vanderbilt University, an M.B.A.
in 1961 from the Harvard Business School, where he was a J. Spencer Love
Fellow, and earned the Chartered Financial Analyst designation in 1969.

b - as above. Several have gone across wholesale already. stats will show 
this and progress on others.

be out by Monday, Cindy Olson has sent an email to HR community (re Embargo

Fran and Michele Cash (I also put another guy on this yesterday) have all in

Subject: Re: Cogentrix Turbine Inquiry  

As a matter of fact, this is on my list to discuss with you. I think we 
should pick up the 7EA's and maybe the 501D's as well (doubt we could pick 
and choose). I met with Mark Frevert yesterday afternoon to discuss the East 
Generation Strategy (along with Ben Jacoby and Don Miller) and he wanted me 
to talk with Larry Izzo about us taking all 4 turbines. Should I go ahead and 
have that discussion or would you like to discuss this in more detail first? 
The LM6000 position looks like this:

24 turbines allocated:

4 City of Austin
4 Enron South America
4 Las Vegas Cogen
6 Public Service of Colorado
6 Florida Merchant plant


Heather Kroll and Ozzie Pagan are bringing their VEPCO/North Carolina deal to 
a point where we will probably need to make a decision in the next 2-3 weeks. 
It has a 4-year PPA and we are basically obligated to build a power plant to 
back-fill the position. The PPA will be able to be served from the market or 
plant, and we would need to use 4 of the 6 dual-fuel LM's currently allocated 
to Florida. There is a possibility we could go back to the 501D's but we'll 
have to see. The ecomomics of the deal leave Enron with about a 40-45% 
residual value on the plant at the end of 4 years, and Bruce Sukaly is in the 
process of showing this entire project to 4 counterparties in order to 
monetize the entire position.

We still have 2-3 other customers looking at the LM's although they are 
moving fairly slow.

I'd like to discuss our development strategy in a little more detail with you 
when you return but here are the highlights: Ben and his team will be looking 
to increase the sites we have under our control in several regions: PJM, 
ECAR, Georgia, and Florida to name a few. I think we may want to consider 
some configurations that include combined-cycle options that have a 5-year 
term (vs. our standard 2-year currently), primarily in Florida and maybe 
Georgia. Ben is putting this on paper along with the incremental resource 
needs and incremental developmental dollars needed. I think we should talk 
about increasing our site bank/development portfolio in Canada as well.  

Let me know your thoughts! Thanks.

I just spoke to Jeff who had just finished his phone call with Dorman (ATT).  Jeff said that Dorman was very interested in our proposal and even had some ideas on expanding the scope of our ideas.  He said that Dorman would like to get together on Weds.  June 6 in Washington DC to continue the discussions.  I'm not quite sure what this means except that it appears that Dorman does have a genuine interest in exploring a big deal with EBS.  So I would recommend that we get together early next week with Jeff and maybe with the Adventis guys and prepare for the 6/6 meeting.

Many of you know Dale Furrow already.  For those who don't, he ran our structuring group in Portland from late 1997 until the middle of 1999.  He's an Army Grad, Wharton Grad, went through the Associate program and left Enron as a Director to join Entergy's Asset Development group working for Jeff Roberts.  He recently tendered his resignation at Entergy and is on the job market.  He is leaving Entergy on good terms -- he simply decided that he doesn't like working there for a variety of reasons.

Dale has a great background for many of the EES/EWS work that we are trying to do now.  He was an AWESOME structurer.  He "gets" trading.  He was responsible for the development and implementation of Entergy Power Marketing's risk systems.  In short, he would be a great catch for us.

I will be in Houston Monday and Tuesday of next week.  I will interview Dale on Tuesday.  I know that Louise and John are in PRC on Tuesday, so they would have to do it later.  Perhaps the rest of us could meet him on Tuesday.  

I don't yet have a specific job nailed down for him.  I think that he could run a URM desk (east or west).  He could run the site profile, asset profile, dsm group.  I would expect that he would expect to come in at a VP level.  I know that's a high bar and hard to do here, which is why I would want this group of people to meet with him.  I have asked Debra Davidson to contact each of you to coordinate these interviews.

Thanks,
Tim

Marty, no agenda on this one at all.  Given, the change in Enron Industrial 
Markets towards building the paper and steel commodity markets and less so on 
the outsourcing product, I just wanted your opinion on whether this is a deal 
we should do especially given the sales cycle is largely completed.  I 
believe that Rodney and his team want to finish this deal but given other 
priorities they would like to transition the deal to EES.  Ultimately, the 
value (TCV, earnings, up-sell, resume) would benefit Enron more in EES than 
ENA.

Although Jeff mentioned a fourth associate, these are the only 3 that are

John after speaking with you, it is clear that you have not been in contact

I have a concern about Enron's forward-looking exposure associated with legacy deals (deals that existed during the June 2000 through the May 2001 price shock).  If Edison gets its way, all customers will pay for Edison's under-recovery from June 2000 through January 2001 plus CDWR spot market purchases during 2001.  This would take the form of a surcharge on future bills.  My concern is that Enron will be on the hook for these future charges associated with past under-collections -- even beyond the term of our legacy deals.  For example, if a deal ends in March 2002 we could be on the hook for surcharges that a legacy customer would receive on its bill after that date, provided the surcharge pertained to costs incurred by the utility during the time that the legacy customer was ours.

I have not received clear guidance from legal on this matter.  For example, I asked both Mike Smith and Steve Hall to review the legacy Safeway contract which is on PGES paper.  They both indicated that there is a better chance than not that we are on the hook for these charges, although good arguments could be made that we should not be responsible for them.  Angela Schwarz indicated to me that outside counsel (I'm not sure who) thinks that we are not on the hook for these charges.

It is critical that we get clear guidance from legal on these risks.  We are in front of customers now deciding whether or not to go forward with extensions or terminate contracts after the initial term.  Customers are asking us to make changes to our "change in law" and "utility non-performance" provisions.  If we believe that we are wearing the surcharge risks beyond the term of the existing contract and the customer is willing to take those from us in exchange for changes to the master agreement we would probably be willing to do it.  If we aren't currently wearing surcharge risk beyond the term of the existing contract then our negotiating position would be different.

As you all know, the magnitude of this risk is potentially large as our negative CTC receivable is in the hundreds of millions of dollars.  If the CPUC were to adopt Edison's proposal for the entire state, EES' customers would be responsible for surcharges of the same magnitude.  At this point, I don't know whether EES or its customers are on the hook for this risk beyond the term of existing contracts.



Vicki -- could you forward this message to Mike Smith.  I couldn't tell which Mike Smith to send it to.

Guys, pending the sale of the Wilton Centre unit, I would suggest that we not 
execute the gas balancing arrangement.  The parties should continue to 
operate and invoice based on the verbal agreement; however, lets not execute 
the agreement or put it in the data room.  We should represent to potential 
buyers that we have an interconnect agreement with Northern Border and have 
been accessing supply out of the Chicago spot market.

All other gas supply/transport/balancing agreements for the other facilities 
(including the Northern Border interconnection and the ComEd reg cap deal) 
will be conveyed to the new buyers through the sale of the LLC.

I don't know if you know the history behind McCullough.  He is a consultant 
who primarily advises industrial loads.  He advised his customers that prices 
were going down and that they should go on index based tariffs rather than 
fixed-price tariffs.  Needless to say, his advise cost his customers a great 
deal of money.  Notable examples are Bellingham Cold Storage and Georgia 
Pacific in Puget Sound Energy's service territory.  Rather than acknowledge 
that he was wrong, Robert is on a witch hunt.  His data is bad, his analysis 
is horrible, he lies with numbers but does a good job being pompous and 
putting together flashy power point presentations.  I have not heard of 
anybody agreeing with him, including the NWPPC, CEC, CAISO, CAPX.  He is a 
loud entertaining speaker, so I am sure that he will continue to get coverage.

Congratulations ( I think?) on your new assignment.

If you get a chance in the next few days, drive by this building I have.  It 
is at 5205 Spruce (2 blocks north of Bellaire Blvd and 2 blocks west of Rice) 
in Bellaire.  It  is a great building for what you need for your cars.  It 
will lease for about $12-$15/sf annually (about 5000 sf including the garage 
space) and I have about $750,000 in the building.  If you have 1/3 of the 
building (+-$250,000) it will cost you about $1,600/mo in interest.  This is 
about what it would cost to put your 3 cars in a climate controlled storage 
space (probably less) at a USTOREIT.  Let me know if you're interested in 
looking at a deal structure.

Ken

We have the AIG Highstar Fund in ENA.  As I understand it ENA committed to $12.5M on this with the other 50% coming from EE&CC.  I understand from Dave that you are taking the P&L swings on this fund.  As they are about to pull further on this money (<1m to date), I wondered how you wanted it treating.

Subject: Merrill Lynch Offer - Termination of Midwest Peaking Trade

Dave,

The Bid Offer is now officially at $0 - $17MM - See below offer from Merrill.

Below is the response from Dan Gordon who was my counterpart at Merrill after 
my discussion with him where I told him I wanted to just terminate the trade 
without paying any fees.  I had asked Dan to come up with a number they would 
think appropriate for terminating the trade.  I also discussed the deal with 
their relationship officer Robert Furst so they are all engaged.  I think Dan 
is simply trying to elicit a higher first bid from us without him doing any 
work or potentially leaving any money on the table since it is us that wants 
to unwind the trade.

I have Rogers Herndon pulling some information on how much the position has 
moved since we did the deal.  I also have him working through what we would 
have done if we owned the deal i.e. how much gas basis risk we would have 
mitigated and what the value would be now as well and any other hedges we 
would have put on and the value of them now.  This will give us information 
to either negotiate or at least get a better picture of what a better offer 
should be.  I have also notified Elizabeth Sager, our lawyer, to dig back in 
and get back up to speed on the deal to prepare to discuss it.  

As I see it our options are: 

Option 1:  Negotiate
Rogers/Kevin/Myself go to NY and negotiate/highlight the risks in the deal 
with ML

Option 2: Relationship Play
Either myself or Cliff start leaning on the relationship people at ML to 
force ML into a more realistic first offer.  

Let me know your thoughts on how you want to proceed.
Rodney

Rodney-

Merrill Lynch has reviewed the transaction that was executed with Enron in
December, 1999 involving physically and financially settled call options on
certain mid-continent peakers owned by Enron.  At that time, a fee of
approximately $17 million was charged to execute the transaction.

Since the execution of the trade, Merrill Lynch has had to manage the risk
associated with the sizeable position as well as hedge certain gas basis
risks that Merrill Lynch was obligated to assume in order to accommodate the
accounting treatment desired by Enron as part of the transaction.
Additionally, as I am sure that you and your traders are aware, the position
has considerably appreciated in value since trade execution.

Even with these factors, Merrill Lynch is prepared to accommodate Enron's
request to terminate the transaction in exchange for a fee of $17 million.
This fee encompasses the original fee that Enron had agreed to pay to
Merrill Lynch and does not take into consideration any of Merrill Lynch's
hedge breakage costs or our foregone upside in the trade.

Should you wish to discuss the matter further, please do not hesitate to
contact me.

Regards, as always.

Dan Gordon

Paul, I had a look at the pitch and I thought it was an intriguing idea.  I 
think it works welll in allocating resources between competing "going 
concerns" but may be more difficult to allocate people to new  businesses 
that may not have the income to fund the best talent.  I also wonder if the 
cost of creating, managing and maintaining a market like this is greater than 
the overall benefit achieved over the existing system.  In its own often 
clumbsy looking way Enron's culture does allocate capital and people fairly 
effectively.

Obviously, these are very cursory remarks - I have not spent a great deal of 
time on this.

Dave,

To the extent you feel it is truly in ENA's best interest, Ed and I are 
prepared to honor your wishes with respect to Tom Swank joining the 
mid-market group.   However, it should be noted that we (as a group) have 
significant reservations about Tom disrupting the chemistry in our group.  
The input from all of my my key guys (including Rogers who worked with Swank 
at Dynegy for a number of years) was negative regarding Tom as a member of 
our team.

We are concerned about his longevity in the group and his work ethic in 
general.  Again, I am prepared to respect your decision (particularly since 
you control my paycheck) and give Tom the benefit of the doubt, but I wanted 
to express my reservations.

Please let me know your thoughts

The weather desk gas gone through a fundamental transformation and has attempted to align itself with the gas and power desks.

We would like to get a West Power org chart and if possible a list of your desk's counterparties (we do not want to interfere with your relationships and weather derivatives may be an additional product to sell to your customers).

Jeff, you will be receiving a DASH from the principal investing group which 
does not fit well into some of the charter criteria; however, I do think this 
is a venture we should support.  In a nutshell, it is providing $10MM, in 
seed capital, to be used in the start up of a new distributed generation 
company having the primary mission of designing, fabricating and marketing 
2MW to 22MW mobile turbine-generator sets.  These units are fully mobile via 
the nations highways and can meet single digit NOX requirements given current 
SCR technology. They are primarily utilized for back-up power, emergency 
power, VAR creation and peaker application and are fully dual fuel capable.  
The ultimate vision is a fleet of mobile/flexible/low cost generator sets 
that can be put in place very quickly in the most stringent emissions and 
constrained electrical regions and relocated when market conditions change.  

The benefits include:
 a) 50% plus interest in a new distributed generation company with the 
opportunity to raise private funds at later rounds and ultimately the 
possibility of an IPO - similar companies in this space include Active Power, 
Capstone and Elektryon;
 b) origination opportunities - the ENA mid-stream origination groups believe 
that there are numerous opportunities (2001 to 2002 time frame) to utilize 
this technology to take advantage of market opportunities and customer 
applications;
 c) learning - the distributed generation/renewable space is an area of 
critical importance for ENA and EES to understand.  If ENA through this 
venture can make this technology work, it could be a very powerful tool in 
our network used to capture opportunity and manage risk;
 d) low risk - it is expected that roughly 50% of the initial seed capital 
would be recoverable through asset sales if for some reason the technology 
did not work or the market did not materialize;
 e) low tech - this solution utilizes existing turbine/SCR technology;
 and f) ENA would have a controlling position in this new venture.

However, this venture is different than Active Power and several other 
Principal Investing investments in that a) it is a very early stage company 
and b) ENA will have to provide or procure a complete management team if the 
technology proves out.  Given, that we could benefit most from the successful 
application of this venture, it is worth the initial work.

Our partner is Power Systems Manufacturing of Boca Raton, Florida.  We have a 
very solid history with this company.  They have successfully solved many of 
the technical issues surrounding the Korean 6B's which are currently 
operating at New Albany.  They would bring the technical and engineering 
expertise at cost for their 50%.  ENA would ultimately have a buy-out clause 
at a fixed number for their 50% .

If you would like to discuss in greater detail do not hesitate to call and I 
will set up a meeting.

Regards
Delainey

Dear David,

My name is David Ronkainen and I have been an Enron employee for about one 
year.  I joined 
Enron as a result of my interest in fuel cells as a business opportunity for 
me.  I met with Dave Ramm 
to discuss that opportunity and he asked me if I would be interested in 
working for Enron.  
I recently read a press release that ENA had entered into an alliance with 
Fuel Cell Energy, Inc.  I still 
have a strong interest in fuel cells and the belief that they will be the 
most commonly used power 
supply of the not so distant future.  I went to a seminar on distributed 
power in Washington D.C. last 
week to talk with the technologists and hear what the investment community  
thought about fuel cells 
and microturbines.  I learned a lot.

Right now I am working for Enron Corp. Environmental, Health and Safety.  My 
job is interesting, but I have 
a stronger interest in fuel cells and the power technology that will serve 
DP.  Do you have a job opportunity
for a technologist in your business that is involved with fuel cells and 
microturbines?  If there is an opportunity
I would like to talk with you about it.

I graduated from Michigan Technological University with a B.S. in Mechanical 
Engineering.  I have worked 
in manufacturing and the oil field service business.  I have worked at the 
corporate level in both businesses.
I know what it takes to efficiently manufacture a product and how a business 
should be run.  I also understand the 
opportunities and liabilities that environmental protection poses to new 
industries and technologies.  I  know
that I can help Enron in this area.

If you would like my resume please let me know.

Thank you for your consideration.

I talked to Giffels today and he mentioned that SONGS units are under serious security scrutiny given its location.   He gave us a 50/50 probability that Indian Pt 1&2 (30 minutes north of NY City) and Pilgrim (15 minutes north of Boston) would be shut down in the near term for security reasons.

He mentioned that SONGS was also a candidate.   I personally don't think the probability is that high, nonetheless, the rumors seem to be in the market.

I spoke with Bob Hermann this afternoon and, in short, the single biggest 
contributor to the increase in the corporate tax allocation relates to the 
expansion of state and local tax support being provided to our new "business 
verticals" - that is, Enron Global Markets, Enron Industrial Markets and 
Enron Net Works - which expense should be specifically allocated to such 
groups rather than ENA, as is currently the case.  I will follow up with you 
regarding the revised number after I have resolved the allocation issue.

Guys, I noticed that the corporate tax allocation to ENA has more than 
doubled from 2000 forecast to 2001 plan ie) $1,600,000 from $700,000.  Could 
you please explain.  Our goal which is being met in ENA's direct expense 
groups is to remain flat year or year from 2000 to 2001.

Rick / Rick / Sally 

I attach the  'executive' summary of a note sent to the office of the chair 
last week detailing current operational difficulties with the Metals 
Merchanting business. Subsequently an 'all hands' meeting was called to 
discuss the operational issues and the business imperatives of 
Off Balance Sheet Facility ("OBSF") renegotiation
Minimising working captial
SAP implementation
The notes of that meeting are also attached at the bottom of this email

Should you require any further information please call, otherwise I will 
forward updates as they are completed.

Regards

Mike



ISSUE

The Physical metals business implemented an Off Balance Sheet Structure 
(OBSF) pre year-end to meet Enron requirements for gearing ratios.

Whilst this does not present undue problems for LME warrants, these being 
bearer documents, it does present an issue when physical metal, the value of 
which depends upon brand and location, is placed into the facility. Given the 
hard deadline of year-end the operational support of this process initially 
took place on spreadsheets.

The impact of the OBSF on the operational side of the physical business 
should not be underestimated. The process of moving material off and on 
balance sheet places considerable strain from trading through to settlements, 
particularly when there is an absence of necessary control functionality in 
the AS400. With the specified functionality it is believed that all 
operational and trading issues arising from OBSF can be managed 
satisfactorily.

The core functionality, which was due prior to the year-end, was released 
during January but was subsequently found to have introduced +bugs, to the 
integrated business control processes. Whilst an improvement on having no 
OBSF functionality, the +bugs, have had an increasingly negative effect on 
the control environment, compounded by the fact that IT can not provide a 
guaranteed delivery for the +bug, fixes and non core ,reporting, 
functionality.

This has given rise to the following concerns:

? There are insufficient experienced resources to fully reconcile stock at a 
brand & location level to coordination records (the global position is 
reconciled however).
? It is not possible to substantiate the DPR for EM&CL as:
? a) P&L on spread moves from Cash to 3 months positions (and related cash to 
3 months provisions) can not be produced by the system and must be estimated, 
and
? b) System bugs have created uncertainties over trial balance values.

These concerns are compounded by the following:

? The most experienced AS400 IT developer for the EM&CL business has 
resigned. He is currently working his 6 months notice which will expire in 
July 2001.
? The most experienced AS400 IT developer on the EML side of the business has 
also resigned. He left in January 2001. 
? There is no documentation for the AS400. It is therefore difficult for 
experienced AS400 programmers to get upto speed on the system.

Conclusion

It is essential that we do not become hostages to the development of the 
AS400 system and the renegotiation of the OBSF facility with Barclays. The 
current situation has arisen due to non-delivery of IT developments and tight 
timescales on the finalisation of the OBSF facility.

To meet Q1 end requirements (i.e. full production of the DPR and stock 
reconciliation), IT and the OBSF deal team must make concrete commitments on 
delivery timeline. The business will not be able to commit to successful 
implementation of the facility and resubstantiation of the Trial Balance 
without these

Soaring natgas prices revive interest in coal
December 07, 2000 3:31:00 PM ET
By Andrew Kelly 

HOUSTON, Dec 07 (Reuters) - Soaring prices for natural gas and concerns about 
future supplies are prompting U.S. electricity generators to take another 
look at coal which had fallen out of favor as gas dominated the nation's 
plans for new power plants. 

Wisconsin Electric started the ball rolling in September with plans to build 
two new 600 megawatt coal-fired power plants, the first to be announced in 
the United States in several years. 

Richard Grigg, president of the Wisconsin Energy Corp.(WEC) unit, said the 
decision was a simple matter of prudence and a way to avoid putting all of 
your eggs in one basket. 

"We believe that a strong diversity in your fuel mix is a very important part 
of having a reliable and low cost electricity supply," Grigg told Reuters in 
an interview. 

Although coal accounts for just over half of U.S. electricity production, the 
economic and environmental advantages of modern gas turbines had made the 
decision about how to fuel new power plants something of a no-brainer in 
recent years. 

Consequently, over 90 percent of new plants currently planned in the United 
States are slated to burn natural gas. 

But as natural gas prices soar, hitting all-time highs of over $9 per million 
British thermal units on the New York Mercantile Exchange this week, Grigg 
suspects that other power producers will also take another look at coal. 

"Given increasing gas prices and concern for supply availability, I think 
you're going to see more people look for ways to utilize coal," Grigg said. 

BACK IN THE PICTURE 

Griff Jones, vice-president of power trading at Dynegy Inc. (DYN), said high 
natural gas prices and recent advances in clean combustion technology had put 
coal back in the picture. 

"A year or two ago people wouldn't bring up the subject of developing a coal 
plant. Today there's talk about it," he said. 

For Dynegy, which began as a natural gas marketer and has made the 
convergence of the natural gas and electric power businesses an article of 
faith, that is quite an admission. 

Since the oil price explosions of the 1970s, the share of oil used in U.S. 
power generation has dwindled to around 3 percent. 

Nuclear plants deliver about 20 percent of the nation's electricity but 
construction of new nuclear plants is widely viewed as politically impossible 
following the accidents at Three Mile Island in 1979 and at Chernobyl in 
1986. 

Natural gas currently supplies about 15 percent of U.S. electricity but is 
projected to gain market share steadily due to power generators' enthusiasm 
for the high efficiency and low emissions of the latest "combined-cycle" gas 
turbines. 

Oil and gas industry executives often cite projected growth in U.S. demand 
for natural gas of 30 trillion cubic feet by 2010, much of it fueled by 
increased use of gas for power generation. 

Plans for new gas-fired power plants are based on the assumption that the 
industry will be able to step up to the plate and deliver ever-increasing 
amounts of gas. 

FLAT GAS PRODUCTION 

In recent years, however, U.S. natural gas production has remained stubbornly 
steady around 19 billion cubic feet, augmented by Canadian imports of around 
3 billion cubic feet. 

The recent surge in gas prices has pushed the number of drilling rigs 
currently searching for gas in the United States to unprecedented levels of 
over 800 from just over 600 a year ago. 

But so far, at least, production remains more or less flat as gas producers 
fight the accelerating depletion of mature fields. 

Plans for a pipeline that would tap huge unexploited gas reserves in Alaska 
will alleviate the supply situation, but the gas would only start flowing in 
the second half of this decade. 

Coal, on the other hand, is abundant and readily available: the United States 
has reserves equivalent to well over 200 years of domestic consumption. 

Ray Niles, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney, estimated in a recent report 
that the United States will need 300,000-400,000 megawatts of new electricity 
generating capacity over the next decade, or somewhere between 800 and 1,000 
new plants. 

Natural gas producers would be hard pressed to supply enough fuel for even 
half of that new capacity, he calculated. 

"Therefore, we think it likely that new coal-fired generating capacity will 
also be necessary to meet demand growth," Niles wrote. "We see no alternative 
fuel capable of producing the necessary power, due to political and time 
constraints." 

Wisconsin Electric's Grigg said it might not be long before other power 
generators followed his own company's lead and drew up plans for new 
coal-fired plants. 

"I have heard some rumblings from others that are also recognizing that 
economics as well as supply issues are starting to look more favorable for 
coal," he said.

 a) Donahue is responsible for the portfolio management function but also 
incorporate the idea of Jeff being responsible for ENA's "capital book" (ie) 
managing existing deals and intimately involved in conjunction with Treasury 
and the various origination groups of which finance transactions get or don't 
get on our books;
 b) Has Fastow clearly put Defner in the ENA Treasurer role? - if so we 
should also mention this in the note;
 c) Chuck Ward ( Generation Investments); Don Miller ( Merchant Generation);
 and d) with regard to commodity structuring ensure it is clear that they 
will facilitate and structure the highest priority/value transactions across 
the organization even though they report to Janet (ie) they don't just work 
on East Origination deals.

Let me see the final before release. Make sure Mark is on side.

Fernley,
On January 25, 1999, I had breakfast in London with a shaking Richard Sage 
who recounted the tail of Barry threatening his bonus and employment for 
doing exactly what Jeff Skilling told him to do in the previous November.  
Subsequently, Richard was "moved" from his position and Barry promoted.   If 
that is dealing with the situation, this actually reflects on your 
credibility.  If you think that an open communication, independent back 
office message was sent to the back and middle office in Houston and London 
by virtue of your promotion of Barry twice in 12 months, then you are sorely 
mistaken. 
On February 2, 2000 the Arthur Andersen team, including Tom Bauer, John 
Sorrells and Jim Brown stated that Barry was an issue in satisfactorily 
completing the Audit tasks from London.
I am not sure what we are attempting to accomplish here.  You have dismissed 
my "advice" and you need to do what you need to do.
If the goal is to get me to change my view, you have a big hole to dig out 
of.  I obviously can't change your point of view.  I still feel a 
responsiblity to express the views that I have and others are afraid to 
surface. It is the inability for people to be heard and feel that they will 
be supported when they step out on a limb that caused us to lose more money 
trading than we ever have from a little office in the middle of nowhere.
Need I go on.

Let us stop the e-mail wars now.  They serve no productive purpose.

Subject: Re: Trading Support Operations - London  

Ted,

We have had discussions about Barry in the past and I have followed-up on 
specific instances you have mentioned - I believe they date back to 1998 and 
prior to my first hand experience of working with Barry throughout 1999, and 
the people who raised concerns then acknowledge that the environment has 
changed since then. We are not so Barry-dependent. We have a team of quality 
risk management professionals as evidenced by the fact that it is the primary 
recruiting ground for the RAC team (David Port, Oliver Gaylard). 

Barry's role is much less hands-on now and he is not our candidate for the 
Global Products position - this will continue to be Kevin Sweeney. The role I 
suggest for Barry is the high level co-ordination of the operations team - 
his energy, enthusiasm and ability to execute on a plan, combined with his 
considerable institutional knowledge, making a superior candidate difficult 
to find. Frankly, I suggested Steve Young not for additional depth, but to 
address the relationship issue that clearly exists - I do not belittle this 
issue, and while I don't think that anyone can point to any "prosecutable" 
offences that Barry may have committed in recent history, his management 
style doesn't help to promote the view that he is totally impartial and 
objective. I will say that he has always been open and frank (very frank) 
with me - indeed if Mally and Sweeney had been as open we may have had a 
different story to tell on Helsinki.

As an aside, I have not been involved in or consulted on the 'World Tour', 
although I know that Barry suggested this sort of thing to Sally a few weeks 
back. I think it is great that Brent Price is involved, but we would be happy 
to contribute staff to this too.

Fernley

Subject: Re: Trading Support Operations - London  

Fernley,
As we discussed earlier this year, I have serious concerns about Barry that I 
think are both well-founded and reasonably well documented.  To be fair, I 
will say that since Q1 of last year, I have not seen any FURTHER 
"prosecutable" offenses and he has made some attempts at being more 
communicative.  However, I am clearly unwilling to stake my career on his 
transformation, particulary with as influential person as John Sherriff in 
charge of the office.  Probably more to the point,
it continues to concern me that London has not developed an operations team 
that is not so Barry-dependent.  Evidence to this effect are, the fact that 
he is your only candidate for the Global Products position, that someone from 
Houston has to be part of the "World Tour"  in Europe (Brent Price), that 
your candidates  for a senior interim operations head in Helsinki was David 
Port or Richard Sage, and that your suggestion for additional depth is Steve 
Young.

Further for the record, I believe that I am not the only one with whom Barry 
has a credibility issue - Arthur Andersen, other Global Products personnell, 
and other risk people in London have expressed similar concerns to me - I 
just happen to be the most vocal.

Subject: Trading Support Operations - London

Rick,

Not wishing to delay the comprehensive review of our trading support 
function, particularly as it relates to our Global Products business, we 
already have Barry Pearce taking a lead in this area.

The issue of concern is whether this should be an interim measure or a more 
permanent solution.  Well - nothing is permanent in Enron and I think Barry 
understands this as well as anybody. If we had a more suitable candidate, we 
would give him/her the job. 

I have seen Barry develop and mature over the last 12 months along with the 
team that we have built around him. I'm convinced that he can add significant 
value by drawing the Global Products support functions 'in to the fold'. 
However, he clearly has a credibility issue with Ted in particular and, 
whilst I do not share Ted's views, I do not hold Barry out as a saint and I 
can see recurring problems if such a key relationship is not well grounded.

I suggest that we continue to search for a candidate - known and trusted 
within Houston, who can instill confidence there. Steve Young (head of RAC in 
London) may be an interesting option, although I'm sure he would not be easy 
to replace. In the meantime we need Barry to take things forward and I will 
be monitoring the situation very closely.

Regards

Fernley.

Couple of points, I would hope you would share with your group on Monday:

 - the European retail business is an important and strategic focus for Enron 
and EES;
 - it encompases a material part of EES's and Enron Europes margin plan for 
2001 - so execution and most probably over performance is key in 2001;
 - it was birthplace of one of the key EES distribution platforms that needs 
to be migrated to North America - Enron Direct and the ITOL structure (for 
the large industrial customer);
 - the European business IS one of the largest growth opportunities going 
forward for EES and EES management will recognize, resource and reward that 
effort;
 - I am very involved in business strategy, execution and deals;
 - I believe in open communication, performance and high performance teams - 
no bullshit politics;
 - I recognize and reward performance, thinking, execution and leadership;
 - I flourish in a culture of ideas, fast action and success;
 - and I will be visiting London to meet everyone probably late February 
early March.

PS - I am already a citizen of the Commonwealth.

Subject: EES Europe - Outsourcing Reorganisation

Introduction

EES has been operating in Europe since late 1999 and in that time a lot of 
progress has been made.  The teams who have worked on Outsourcing in Europe 
have learnt a tremendous amount over the last year.  We now have a much 
clearer idea of what should work today in the different jurisdictions that 
comprise Europe and those elements of our offering with which customers are 
most comfortable.

The phenomenally strong financial performance in 2000 of Enron Direct and 
ETOL graphically demonstrate the future potential in Europe for a broad 
retail energy business.  With Enron's retail energy presence in Europe firmly 
established, we are restructuring our Outsourcing product offering and the 
organisation to develop and deliver it, so that we broaden our activities and 
successfully grow our earnings in line with shareholder expectations.

We now have a renewed focus in 2001.  The emphasis will be to work on only 
the largest deals (by energy commodity spend) in those markets where we 
already have a robust wholesale energy business and there is regulated and 
economic third party access to retail power distribution systems.  The main 
thrust of our offering will be commodity and Demand Side Management (DSM) 
projects and our associated price risk management capabilities.  Commodity is 
Enron's core competence and one where Enron should be in a position to 
generate sizeable gross margin at closure.  DSM projects are also important 
as they will deliver gross margin and are what differentiate us from the 
commodity competition.  We will be focussing on shorter project lead times at 
the front of a deal to ensure that we get to closure promptly - we need to 
see 80% of the value in 20% of the time.  Whilst we retain an understanding 
of O&M, this will not form part of our core offering and we will only 
consider involvement in an O&M capacity on attractive margin transactions 
where it is essential to the customer.  As the business develops it is likely 
that, to some extent, we will build the necessary O&M delivery capability to 
enhance the product offering in the future.

In those markets where we have limited wholesale capability or the third 
party access to power distribution systems is not feasible in a retail 
context, we will build and develop Utility Representation Services (URS) in 
conjunction with a DSM project offering.  This knowledge based business will 
allow us to develop retail customer networks in advance of economic system 
access and also provide valuable market information back to the wholesale 
business.  URS is ERPAG's core business and gives us a tremendous platform to 
create a pan European URS competence.

Expertise in Supply Side Management has increasingly become an issue for the 
origination team in EES Europe as we have begun to get into material deal 
development.  Whilst it is vital that we remain totally coordinated with the 
wholesale business for price risk management services, there will be a 
renewed emphasis within EES Europe to develop those commodity skills that do 
not reside in the wholesale business to allow us to promptly and effectively 
price and structure retail commodity transactions to the delivery point.

Given the renewed focus outlined above, we have taken the opportunity to 
streamline the Account Delivery and Management team, typically redeploying 
staff where they can immediately support the development of new business for 
EES Europe.  Effective Account Management remains a key capability for EES 
and as we close deals with customers we will review our staffing need in this 
area.

Organisation

After eighteen months working on establishing the outsourcing business in 
Europe, Ron Bertasi has decided to transition back to the US during the first 
half of 2001.  In the short term he will complete the Trillium property deal 
and ensure that the energy and property deals are both successfully 
launched.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank Ron, on behalf of 
everyone in Europe, for all his hard work over the last eighteen months in 
establishing the European Outsourcing business and in particular his 
leadership on the Trillium deal which represents a substantial landmark for 
the business.

Stuart Rexrode is now head of European Energy Services Outsourcing.  Stuart 
will continue in a customer facing capacity as a lead originator, whilst 
ensuring that all of the dimensions that comprise the Outsourcing team remain 
appropriately focussed.  Bob Manasse will head up the origination team and 
ensure that the deal pipeline remains full of substantial good quality 
prospects.

Hala Tayyarah has been promoted to Manager within the Commodity team and will 
provide commodity pricing support to the origination team.  Hala will report 
to Peter Redpath until such time as a head of Supply Side Management is 
appointed.

Reporting to Peter Redpath, Peter Ramgolam will lead a new activity, 
Transaction Economics, supporting Origination by developing cashflow models 
to determine deal economics, identify improvements to structures to optimise 
value and capture transactions for risk management purposes.

Also reporting to Peter Redpath, John Parker will lead the implementation of 
a Position Management activity.

The attached organisation charts show these changes in the revised structure 
of EES Europe which is effective immediately.  Whilst these charts are 
relatively self explanatory for the levels shown, there will be detailed 
discussions over the next day or so to explain what the changes mean for 
individuals.  Where boxes are labelled TBA, we hope to make appointments in 
the near future.

At 10.30am on Monday 12th February we shall be holding a one hour EES-Europe 
all employee meeting in the Auditorium in place of the usual weekly staff 
meeting.  At this session we will talk about the 2001 Earnings Plan and 
provide clarity on the deal process for Outsourcing and the reasoning behind 
it.  Also, it will be an opportunity for you to raise any questions you may 
have.  I look forward to seeing you there.

Matthew

Subject: Doyle Financial changes since Fall 99

Ronnie and Russell,

Attached find a revised financial model for the Doyle project.  The model 
contains the changes that have occurred since this model was last updated in 
the Fall of 1999.  While the model is lengthy, I will summarize the major 
differences in the project.

1).  Capital Cost Increases:

The project capital cost has increased from the original plan.  The increases 
are dur to the following changes from our initial budget:

a) Planned purchase of the neighbor's house  $   140,000
b) Added cost of the sewer line    $      59,000
c) Output bonus on the PDA for max 5 MW   $1,725,000
d) IDC increase from increase in interest rates  $   574,000
 Total       $2,498,000

2).  Total Output change from 342 MW to 351.6 MW.  This assumes that unit 1 
will test at 62.2 MW. (the same as units 2 & 3)

3).  Project Net Value Increases due to Output Increase:

Impact of the added plant output is very positive.  It increases cashflow and 
debt service coverage.  The net increase to Walton is an additional 
$2,568,000 in value.  Walton's NPV increased from $5,281,000 to $7,849,000.  
This NPV includes Walton's project returns, the cost of interest on equity, 
the cost and recovery of LTCTs, and the asset management fee.

If you have any question, please call.

Clay

Subject: Re: california  

Dave --

To your direct question of should Enron take a more active role in supporting 
or nominating Board members, I agree fully.

I would add the following thoughts:

First, I think that Enron's key position in terms of ISO / RTO governance 
should be that Boards (or the leadership and staff of transmission providers) 
should be indifferent to the price at which the commodity trades.  ISOs and 
RTOs should only worry about transmission, not the price of the commodity 
they are transmitting.   Winning on this issue will be critical as RTOs are 
proposed throughout the country to meet Order 2000 obligations.   

Also, Enron needs to really go after FERC for abdicating its wholesale market 
authority to ISOs, especially ISOs like in California that are dominated by 
state political figures.  FERC is responsible for ensuring just and 
reasonable rates, not some stakeholder Board established by state 
legislation.  We need to argue strongly that FERC must take back this 
authority in the near term and utilize its administrative procedures to 
impose any market changes.  

Finally, given that it will be some period of time before there is truly a 
"financially indifferent" transmission provider under Order 2000, Enron must 
take an active role in working within and through the Boards of the current 
ISOs.   A good example is the way that Dan Allegretti works within the 
NE-ISO.  These Boards and the ISOs are fundamentally political 
organizations.  Our representatives must take the time to get to know the 
people so that when key issues arise, we are able to influence the decisions.

Thanks, 

Jim

Guys, good job with the California issues - we didn't get everything but we 
managed the position in a very effective manner.

Jim, given our view to support the growth of the ISO structures as a 
necessary evil and given the socio-political leaning of these entities, 
should we be more actively or aggressively supporting or nominating directors 
on these boards?

Jim/Rick, we need a full court press on this NEPool ICAP issue - Allegretti 
is putting plan in place.

There have been no "official" developments relating to Enron North America or the Portland office that I am aware of since the floor meeting on Wednesday.  The news of the Europe office closing so suddenly has certainly been unsettling.  Absent any tangible news pertaining to the fate of our office I thought that I could, at a minimum, try to explain to people what I've seen going on over the last couple of days.

On the trading side we are doing several things.  First, we are trying to honor as many of our physical delivery obligations as possible.  Several customers have stopped making deliveries to us which is making it impossible for us, in turn, to honor all of our physical deliveries.  In these circumstances we are constantly updating our customers on the status of their schedules so that they can make alternative arraingements.  The Cash Trading, Scheduling, Services, and Real Time groups are doing an unbelievable job with this.  I am impressed at how capable, professional, and calm our team has remained.  On the Term Trading side we are working with our customers to close out positions.  This process is going very smoothly as well.  We traded a record volume yesterday as our customers reduced their exposure to us.  The Term trading team has done an excellent job with this.  Third, on the Middle Market and Origination side we are trying to work with customers to bring cash in the door.  Many customers owe us money due to out of the money future positions.  Many customers would prefer to settle up with us now rather than in bankruptcy if that is what ends up happening to us.  We have brought a significant amount of cash in the door as a result of these efforts and saved our customers from going through a potentially onerous bankruptcy proceeding.  I am very appreciative of the efforts of our Origination and Middle Marketing team that has made this happen.

On the bright side, I remain optimistic that someone will buy or fund the North America gas and power businesses.  While it is impossible to handicap anything these days with Enron I am seeing some very positive signs on this front.  Unlike the Dynegy deal, which required Dynegy to purchase the very profitable core business along along with the rest of Enron's baggage, the deals being considered now would likely involve only the core business.  I don't know whether these deals happen, and if they do, I don't know what form the core business takes as a result.  Chris Calger and I have been part of the team talking to our potential suitors.  We will both be in Houston through the weekend and into early next week working on this.  We will update people as soon as possible as things unfold.

I know that this situation really sucks.  Given the anxiety and uncertainty that we are all feeling people are doing a great job keeping focused and staying positive.  I think that things are going to unfold very quickly from here -- most likely in the next week or two.  Please hang in there.

Tim

Body:
As many of you know, The University of Texas has its most significant 
fundraising effort underway.  As a part of that effort, the Red McCombs 
School of Business is trying to raise $130 million which will help it to 
achieve its goal to become the next great business school in the world.  
Obviously, the Red McCombs gift of $50 million (the largest ever contributed 
to the University) is a big part of that effort.  However, much more is 
needed and will only be achieved through participation by a significant 
number of alumni and friends of the University.

On Tuesday, February 6th at 2 pm, Dean Bob May of the McCombs School will be 
at the Enron Building to meet with us about the School's plans and how we can 
participate.  I am organizing this meeting for Bob and inviting all Enron 
officers that are UT alumni.  This should be a very informal meeting with 
relatively few attendees (hopefully around 25 people).  It will give you a 
chance to get to know Bob, what is going on at the Business School and how 
you can participate. Make no mistake.  We hope the result is that you decide 
to support the effort.  There is a unique opportunity to participate at this 
time because, in addition to matching funds from Enron, the McCombs gift 
provides for additional matching funds for contributions of a certain level.  
I have found that this matching provides a real opportunity to make endowment 
level gifts.

Enron and the McCombs School have a great partnership.  The company has made 
a significant commitment to the school's programs, we have a very significant 
presence on campus through our activities and support from administration and 
faculty, and we have enjoyed great success recruiting for a number of years.  
However, Enron has never successfully organized its alumni giving in a way 
which would allow for even greater Enron support and presence while 
optimizing each individual's contribution.  I am hopeful that as a group of 
Enron officers, we can set the example of coordinated giving.

Please plan to attend the meeting.  It will be held in the Board Room on 50, 
last about an hour and refreshments will be served.  Please let me or Sharron 
Westbrook (extension 37094)  know if you can attend.  Thanks.

Something strange happened in Enpower yesterday.  A deal from the STNW book was changed and we aren't sure why.  It appears that some strips from a $180 sale in NP15 were erased.  Our theory is that something happened between FSP and Enpower that erased these strips.  Of course, we don't know what happened, which is why I am contacting you.  This is really scary if our systems are changing deals.  The only reason that we noticed was because of a huge P&L hit to the STNW book.  If the price of the deal had been closer to current market we wouldn't have noticed.  Please look into this and let the trading team know what happened.

Subject: SDG&E Complaint vs. Sellers into Calif ISO / Calif PX

SDG&E filed a Complaint with the FERC that requests an "emergency order 
capping at $250 per MWh the prices" for all parties selling into the Calif 
ISO and the Calif PX.   SDG&E claims that the Calif ISO and the Calif PX are 
"fundamentally flawed and inherently incapable of producing workable 
competition".

EPMI is directly impacted by this Complaint.   Even though FERC has approved 
EPMI's Market-Based Rate certificate after a finding that we had no market 
power, this Complaint would restrict us from selling at above $250 per MWh 
into the Calif ISO and Calif PX.

Government Affairs is responding in two ways --

1. A direct response from EPMI to FERC responding that there has been no 
finding that EPMI has market power and therefore we should not lose our 
market-based rate authority.

2. A response through WPTF (Western Power Trading Forum) and EPSA to argue 
more broadly the facts of what is going on in California (bad hedging by 
SDG&E) and poor market structure rules.

The fundamental problem is that the FERC is running scared about price spikes 
and may, without any real thinking, approve such a Complaint.  SDG&E has 
asked for expedited treatment and a decision could be out as early as mid 
August.

This issue again highlights how important the on-going FERC Investigation in 
Market Issues is for Enron.  We are putting together a detailed plan of how 
Enron will present our recommendations to FERC in this Investigation and will 
discuss this with you.

Call with questions.  

Thanks,

Jim

Adam, I believe that we have formally responded to all your issues as per 
your memo to me of August 8, 2000. In all or almost all cases, we have 
accepted your position.  The agreement should look and behave very closely to 
what you would have signed with the competing utility. In addition, ENA is 
paying a higher price, sharing credits and have voluntarily increased the 
term to twelve years from ten.

I do not understand what is holding up completing this transaction other than 
a complete re-trade on the original transaction. I hope this is not the 
case.  The ENA team worked hard to facilitate this transaction for Enron 
Wind.  In fact, we were originally solicited by Enron Wind to help build the 
merchant wind market and we had to coax Enron Wind to do this transaction 
with ENA versus TXU.

I look forward to finding a solution to this current impasse.

Delainey

Body:
Louise, I would like you to re-consider our original proposal for a few reasons.  I have a lot of history on this one given I've been on both sides of the fence and was the original creator of what ultimately became the EIM group.  As a result, I  have been in many discussions with Lou and Jeff on these issues.

In the original agreement between EES and ENA the following SIC codes were excluded from EES as part of the minority shareholder agreement in 1996/1997:
	Mining (except Oil and Gas);
	Oil and Gas Extraction
	Textile Manufacturing
	Paper Manufacturing
	Chemical Manufacturing
	Petroleum and Coal Products Manufacturing
	Plastics and Rubber Products Manufacturing
	Glass Manufacturing
	Primary Metal Manufacturing
	Fabricated and Metals Products Manufacturing
	Machinery Manufacturing
	Rail Transportation.

All other SIC codes fell within EES.  In 2000, with the buy-back of the minority shareholders, Lou, Jeff and I agreed to move several of the lower process load SIC codes into EES including Textile Manufacturing (like Springs Industries), Glass Manufacturing (like Owens Corning), Fabricated and Metals Product Manufacturing (like General Cable and American National Can) and Machinery Manufacturing (like Lockheed Martin).  This was primarily because these customers tend to be of lower energy sophistication and consumption, numerous sites (in deregulated and regulated environments) and of small size.  The EES value proposition fit these customers much better than wholesale.  We have completed numerous significant term transactions and outsources in these industries (see parenthesis for several).

For the other SIC codes, these remained in ENA and EIM.  EES has no interest in paper mills, smelters, fertilizer manufacturers, refiners, etc.  We neither have the products or pricing capability to manage or close very large process oriented consumers.  However, there are divisions inside these companies that we have been able to have some success.  For example, the speciality chemicals divisions of the large chemical companies tend to be significantly smaller loads and ignored from a capital, DSM and commodity point of view by the large purchasing agents.  Another example, is the gasoline retailing networks for the large oil and gas/refining companies which can be very small loads spread over thousands of sites.  Another example, is the specialty paper/container board divisions of the paper companies.  In several of the large oil and gas and petrochemical companies we have found fertile ground in their office buildings and research centers.  Our proposal to limit EES's activities in the ENA SIC codes by consumption size was to give us some freedom to target these divisions inside these companies which ENA would normally ignore.  If there is a better way to split this out than by a size definition lets discuss.  Finally, given the more targeted and sophisticated sales process utilized in EES (by necessity), it would be easier to coordinate between the companies based on a size sort where EES had limited access to ENA's SIC codes versus the opposite.

On the surface your proposal looks reasonable; however, it fails to sufficiently manage the issues. For example:
	- how would you manage a customer like Wal-Mart which may use more than 10 MW at a site but requires a national or regional  solution for all 10,000 sites in both deregulated and regulated jurisdictions;
	- how will we sufficiently manage the ENA sales force which tends to over-cover and "under-product" for the vast majority of these industries and customers ie) I think it would be a disaster for EES and ENA;
	- and EES has the relationship based selling capability and basic products to successfully manage these customers (you could argue right now that is all we have!).

On a final note,  I believe strongly that John and I should send out a note to both organizations clarifying these issues because:
	a) it is way overdue - years in fact - it was always difficult when I was upstairs to get Lou to cooperate;
	b) it is extremely destructive and un-productive for multiple Enron groups to communicate and target the same customer;
	c) I don't believe that the employees (on both side of the fence) will honor the obligation unless it is expressly stated, openly communicated and enforced by the two management teams;
	and d) we need to be proactive, because "cleaning" it up after the dual call, etc significantly damages our credibility as Enron with a number of these customers.

It may be worthwhile in the same exercise to let you know what we may be doing in the the utility and generator markets in the interest of open communication and ensure your buy-in.

I look forward to futher discussing this with you. Our motivations are not to try and  enter ENA markets but to split the industrial and commercial segments between the two companies clearly which increases productivity and shareholder value.

Regards
Delainey

Janet,

Tried to get through to you but no success so far this afternoon.  I have removed the split from East to West.

Load

Power
ENA > 10 MW Hourly Peak Demand
EES < 10 MW Hourly Peak Demand

Gas 
ENA > 1,000 MMBTUs/day
EES < 1,000 MMBTUs/day

I am still working on the codes but the issue is that things like Fertilizer companies are not included in the lists so they may cause more confusion tha add value.

Louise

Subject: Free stuff we want

Dave,

We would like to have two put swaptions with the following parameters

1. Enron sells 50,000 tons/year financially
 RISI NBSK US index (pulp)
 June 2000-May 2005
 Fixed price of 675 US$/ton
 Until 1 May 2000 Enron the right to put the above to FJ

2. Enron sells 50,000 tons/year financially
 PPW 42# east average (linerboard) 
 July 2000-May 2008
 Fixed price of 450 US$/ton
 Until 1 May 2000 Enron has the right to put the above to FJ

Either of the above would make us 10mm over where we are able to sell the 
swaps out now.  Either trade would be immediately cash flow positive upon 
execution - so I expect FJ shouldn't grimace too much.  If both Skeena and 
Re-Box were to blow up we wouldn't exercize on the linerboard option buy may 
be able to make 4 or 5 million on the pulp option.  We don't have any other 
"pretty" deals that would enable us to recoup 10mm.  If possible I would 
suggest you get them to look at the above and before any commitment to the 
swaption is made we should have a better idea of the status of each project.

Bob

Good, valid points.  I think that I agree that we should not have a tour 
strictly for "control" purposes.  Ted, how do you feel about the concept of a 
general business tour on an annual basis that would touch on, but not solely 
focus on controls?

Subject: R-squared World Tour

Dear R2:?I would like you to consider the following in determining the appropriate ?course of action in your mission to ensure that all our offices have process, ?procedures and policies to adequately support the business activities:??  I believe that your going on a series of trips is precisely the wrong ?approach and not only do I think it will be relatively unproductive (as ?compared to your tremendous productivity at home base) but I honestly believe ?it will be counterproductive. Here's why:??   1) While you guys are on a plane or in a remote office, you will be less ?in touch and available to make decisions at home?   2) When you are preparing to go and de-compressing from having been, you ?will be distracted, tired and attempting to catch up to all your     other ?duties.?   3) There are only two of you and many of them.?   4) Please don't take this the wrong way, but I question whether you even ?are the best qualified from a skill perspective (Kevin Sweeney,     Vlady ?Gorny, John Vickers, et al might be the best to dig into the details)?   5) When you guys are the face, it means the rest of us are not.  This ?means that our presence and authority, which will be required on ?    an on-going basis in order for this to have lasting effect, will be ?completely undermined.   Senior people need to know that if a ?    Sweeney, Murphy, Hardy,  etc walks into their office and finds something ?not right, that it will be communicated up the line with     reprecussions.  ?If you were to investigate anonomously, I believe that a universal theme is ?that stuff gets pointed out and nothing     ever gets changed.  It puts those ?in the position of knowing on the defensive and sounding shrill.??My suggestions is that you stay home.  Sally, AA myself and others should ?develop a template for consistent analysis of the offices and a plan to ?maintain an on-going pressure and results.  Part of that plan would be a ?requirement to report to you guys the findings and recommendations in a ?concise way  with you following up to the heads of those offices about what, ?if anything, needs to change as quickly as possible after the review.    ??The most important things you can do will be to pave the way for our ?departure, be available to assimilate the findings and be prepared to ?follow-up.  Everyone already knows that they need to respect your wishes.  ?They need to know (as do we) that we have your support and you will respect ?and act on our recommendations.  ??Thank you for indulging me.  I am afraid that I am correct.?Ted??

louise,
no hi how are you doing?  no how is it going up there in portland?  you just come in and go right for the west desk's eol jugular.  

as everyone knows, the west power desk has a spotty record, at best, on maintaining eol volumes.  there are some good reasons for this and some lame, tired excuses which i'm sure we will discuss in great detail in the near future.

i currently don't get the ice reports and will make sure i am on the distribution.  from what our traders tell me and what the report that you sent indicates, ice is having an even harder time in the west than we are.  it looked like there were two one-month deals on ice that day totalling 20,000 MWh.  in contrast, we had 87 transactions totalling 269,000 mwh.  if i'm reading it right, the ice report actually makes us look good by comparison!

We look at ICE volume reports every day and they are doing about 10-20% of the volumes (and # transactions) we are doing on EOL.   We are doing 300-350 transactions per day in East Power and ICE does approx. 45-50 transactions per day.

Guys, as a follow up to our meeting today, I thought I would put together a 
list of deliverables agreed to in the meeting.  The goal would be to have a 
definitive strategy for HPL and storage assets by the end of July that could 
be acted upon.

 a) Elimination of the Entex contract - current value - John L.;
 b) Storage value algorithm incorporating spread values, increasing intra-day 
and monthly volatility and blowdown values - Jean M, John L, Jim S.;
 c) Storage acquisition targets and issues surrounding value/execution - top 
5 to 10 for blowdown and tarantula strategy - Jean M, Julie G.;
 d) Structure, value, cost and issues surrounding Bammel "header" - Jean M.;
 e) Project Torque - definitive balance sheet, income statement and 
contribution margin statement for HPL - Wes C.;
 f) Establish viability of selling HPL assets - small private placement - 
working with Lehman to finalize value, exection risk, timing, structure et al 
- Patrick   W.
 
 I would like this group to get back together in the fourth week of July to 
determine a final action plan.

Regards
Delainey

Dave...a brief update re Toronto. We have moved from 3 employees Jan 1, 2000 
to 13 employees. Recent hires are as follows:

1. Scott Gilbert (expat)   Manager  Volume Management
2. Chris Gaffney (from ENA)  Sr Counsel  Legal
3. Garrett Tripp (expat)   Manager  Power Trading
4. Jeff Borg (outside hire)  Director   Origination 
5. Steven Leung (from ENA)  Analyst   Origination
6. Dave Ellis (outside hire)  Manager  Volume Management
7. Dan Dorland (UofC grad)  Analyst   Origination
8. Lindsey Huculiak (outside hire) Admin Asst  General
9.Jahnet Theberge (oustside hire) Sr Admin Asst  General
10. Neil Stuchbury (outside hire)  Sr Specialist  Volume Management

As discussed, we have attempted to obtain a good mix of  "Enron DNA" and 
outside hires. We are currently in the process of hiring a marketer from Duke 
who covers eastern industrials on the gas side (John Guerriero, an engineer,  
background is UnionGas) and would like to target a couple of associates from 
Houston.  

Our national advertising campaign has finished its run and we received in 
excess of 350 resumes. We are currently reviewing the resumes and have 
scheduled an off-cycle Super Saturday for June 24th in Toronto (Davies, Le 
Dain, Kitagawa, Devries, Dadson, McKay and myself will conduct the 
interviews).

If you have any questions or concerns, please let me know.

There are only a few available spaces at the upcoming Harvard Forum.  Don't
miss this new and exciting event.  Make your reservations today.  See
meeting details below.
**********************************************

Harvard University Club of Houston - Harvard Forum
"Raising Children of Character in A World of Affluence"
Dinner and Discussion Club

Join us for a new type of Harvard Club experience.  Ever wanted to talk
substantively about a topic, while having a great dinner, but were afraid
that your dinner guests would not be able to go the distance with you in
the conversation?  We have the solution.

Modeled after a format that members David and Anne Grizzle and Danguole
Spakevicius and William Altman have been enjoying for years, the Harvard
Forum will provide an opportunity for an extended conversation with fellow
club members.

The format works like this:  we'll have dinner, and then a panel of Harvard
grads will give brief introductions to the evening's topic from their
perspective, and then we will all engage the topic for ourselves, first in
a large group and then in small groups.  The panel members will be
knowledgeable, but not so expert that anyone will be intimidated.  They
will, however, be provocative to assure that the subsequent conversation is
lively.  You will come away knowing your fellow club members better than
ever - maybe better than you ever wanted.

The topic we've picked is one with which many of us have struggled.  Our
children may be growing up in a world far more affluent - privileged - than
we enjoyed.  How imperiled is their character by our success?  What
practical steps can we take to insure that we pass along to them the
character values that we treasure?

We plan to schedule a Harvard Forum every quarter.

Because of the format, attendance is limited.  Please respond as indicated
below.

When:    Friday, May 18, 7:30 p.m.
Where:   Briar Club, 2603 Timmons (East Briar Room)
Cost:      $35.00 per person

Reservations:  Email dottie@kerr-solutions.com or call 281/424-3084
(Payment must be made at time of reservation by credit card or mailing
check to 3413 Cobblestone Lane, Baytown, TX 77521-1956.)

For further information, contact David Grizzle (david_grizzle@yahoo.com or
713-324-2966) or Danguole Spakevicius (danguole@fempartners.com or

Subject: Ontario Update

Dave, I didnt get a chance to talk to you during your meeting but thought I 
should make you aware of the following. Unfortunately, we have experienced a 
bit of a set-back re Ontario market opening. As you know, the market was 
scheduled to open November 1,2000. We had anticipated somewhat of a delay and 
had forecasted a Feb 1, 2001 start. This week the Minister of Energy 
announced that market opening would be delayed "about 6 months". This of 
course is very dissppointing to us and Aleck Dadson is working hard with the 
Ministry and other interested parties in shoring up a date with a tighter 
time frame.

The reason for the delay is primarily due to the lack of readiness on behalf 
of the IMO. This is a frustrating situation for the minister and as such he 
has moved to appoint myself to the IMO Board. It should be noted that the 
Minister did not accept the IMO's board recommendation but unilaterally went 
with me. He was intent on appointing someone who had goal alignment re 
opening this market asap. This goes a long way in illustrating the great job 
our regulatory group (Aleck Dadson) has done/is doing  in 
positioning/developing credibility with the Ministry of Energy.   

I know that you had concerns re time commitment but I believe strongly that 
Enron needs a voice at the IMO Board as this is a critical point in time to 
shape this marketplace.

Regards
Milnthorp

Kevin, If we respond to the RFP with what we believe to be market prices and

No, I don't think so.  TVA wants a two year PPA with 100% control, including 
AGC and hourly dispatch.  We would have to price the capacity and energy 
product they are asking for extremely high, and we run the risk of increasing 
our LD exposure in the pending litigation.

If Elizabeth thinks we can use the RFP to help our legal case, I would 
certainly support a response that helps our overall ecomomic position.

The state treasurer sent a letter this afternoon to Loretta Lynch.
The treasurer claims in the letter that, by extending DA  through Sept. 20th, the PUC could have shifted more than $8 billion to small customers.
He urges Lynch to immediately roll back the date to July 1.
We have started working with large customers to refute the letter.
If you would like a copy of the letter, please send your fax number to Joseph Alamo.

Guys, can you start working on your presentations for the offsite.  

Dave I would like you to focus on the new generation of capital products that 
you are working on for the IPP market which should be able to source short 
and medium term commodity liquidity and be syndicatable(?) on the capital 
side.  Go into some detail and speak to a couple of specific opportunities. 
It may also be interesting for you to give an initial cut on the economics of 
coal generation (including emissions control) given current power and gas 
markets and a quick view of the development process. How should we 
participate in this market?  Gasification technology?

Jeff, in your talk, can you focus on the emerging distributed generation 
sector ie) the technologies, the users, the VC's, etc.  Specifically, how 
will these technologies change our business model and the overall power 
business model?  How are we positioning ourselves in this market?  What is 
the PI strategy with this regard? 

Dorie Hitchcock and Tammy Sheppard can do a lot of the heavy lifting; 
however, we need a first cut by December 8th.

Thanks
Delainey

Tim, sorry for the delay - lets talk if you think it is warranted.  I can see 
a lot of positives to take this path. However,  there are a) pr issues and b) 
we have hoards of on-going litigation that cost us a bundle.  We should make 
this decision very carefully.

Subject: Plan Questions

The total depreciation plan number for west trading is $278,000.  Here is the 
general breakdown

    Net Book Value  Planned Amount  Depreciation Period
Floor Buildouts   $462,000  $135,000   3 to 5 years
PC's and Monitors  $214,000  $50,000    3 years
Large Plasma Screens  $77,000   $46,000    3 years
Other    $25,000   $7,000    3 years
2001 Increase      $40,000 

Total    $778,000  $278,000


Here is the headcount breakdown:



   Current   2001 Plan  Change  Realistically
Trading   41   48   +7  +5   (2 RT, 2 analysts on desk, 1 admin.)
Mid Mkt & Svcs  9   12   +3  +1 or +2  (increase coverage)
Fundamentals  7   9   +2  +1   (supply person with hydro knowledge)
Structuring  0   0   0  +2   (group is 4 -- Chris planned half, I need to 
plan for half)

Totals   57   69   +12  +9 or +10

It looks like my number is two or three too high.  We also had a mixup on 
planning for the existing structuring group.  Let me know if you have any 
questions.


Also,  I need to talk to you about the City of Vernon.  I want to sue them.  
Several months ago they flaked on a purchase that has cost us about 
$10,000,0000.  Richard Sanders has done the basic legwork and it looks like 
we have a decent case.  I talked to Chris about it, and we both agree that it 
doesn't hurt the west business if we poke them in the eye.  They are not well 
liked in the muni community out here, so the collateral damage should be 
minimal.  The big question is how will this appear in the face of all of the 
ongoing investigations?  Perhaps we should set up a call with me, you, Lavo, 
Sanders, Calger, and Kean?  Let me know your thoughts.

Subject: Trading Tapes

I would like to change our policy regarding taping telephone trades.  I 
propose the following:

1.   Retention Period  -- change the retention period from 4 months to 2 
months

2.  Record Only Deal Terms -- change from taping everything to taping only 
the deal terms at the end of a call

The first change could be made immediately and the second change would 
require both reprogramming (Phillippe is looking at this) and training of the 
traders to press the record button at the end of a call to record the deal 
terms.  Let me know your thoughts on the proposed changes.

You should have recently received an e-mail from Amy Fitzpatrick with proposed contract numbers for most of the people in my group.  I have met with each person on my staff to discuss ballpark numbers.  I don't have definitive offers from anyone, nor have I shown them definitive bids.  However, I have asked each person to provide me with a ballpark value that they would be willing to do.  On an encouraging note, the ballpark values were in line with what we ultimately offered Crandall.  However, these values are significantly above the "standard proposal" put forth earlier.  I would very much like to get these guys done without forcing them into the painful shopping process.  I think these numbers get us there and are consistent with what I believe to be "market" for west power traders, as is evidenced by Sean Crandall.

I would like to set up a meeting to discuss ASAP.  Perhaps David should figure out a time for us to get together to talk through the spreadsheet.

Guys, Power Systems has given me a proposal to replace the New Albany and 
Doyle 7B burners.  This could possibly have two benefits:
 a) elimination of the possibly tainted equipment given current patent issues 
they are having with GE and
 b) apparently the newer technology significantly reduces the Nox emission 
correlating into increased operating hours.

I need two things to determine if we want to move forward:
 a) Mark we need to be bullet proof on the patent (or lack thereof) issues on 
the new equipment and that it would protect us from further exposure and
 b) Mitch, Kevin, Mike and Bob, I need your technical and commercial opinions 
on the merits of this proposal (ie) do you as a team support this proposal?

I believe the timing on this is rather short. Please get back to me at your 
earliest convenience. I will forward a copy of the proposal to each of you.

Subject: CA ISO Sumer Reliability Generation

Dave,

The CA ISO Board met today and approved a plan to provide capacity subsidies 
to up to 2,000 MW of new supply.  There was 71 proposals from 24 companies.  
We offered 7 proposals.  Their decision criteria is ridiculous and subject to 
change, but it looks like we won the following:

1 LM6000 - 45MW - Pleasonton - $6.9MM per year for three years -  $153/kwyear

1 LM6000 - 45MW - LODI - $6.9MM per year for three years - $153/kwyear

4 FT4's - 96MW - Southern/Palo Alto - $13.2MM per year for three years - 
$137/kwyear

Las Vegas Cogen / EPMI 225MW Palo Verde Sale $10MM per year for three years - 
$44/kwyear

In the first three deals, we have the full rights to the energy; capacity 
payments are for availability.  These payments, combined with reasonable toll 
values, terminal value and EPC costs, make the projects economic (DASH 
forthcoming).

The last deal is a bit strange and non-conforming but the ISO likes it 
because it is priced very low.  Basically, we agree to deliver power to the 
ISO at the California border next summer priced at PX Index plus $20/MWh.  CA 
ISO takes power, sells into PX and receives Index.  This is cheaper than what 
they are paying for new capacity in state.  The $20 premium is simply the 
basis between Palo and SP15.  In 2002 and 2003, LVCogen commits to sell 500 
hours to CA ISO and receive PX for its energy.  In 02 and 03, the Palo/SP 
spread collapses so an asset buyer sees this $20MM as gravy.

Lot of moving parts - I will keep you posted.  Parquet, Mcdonald and Laird 
are doing a great job.

Chris

interim authority, expires today.  Given current market conditions, I would 
request  an extension of that interim limit - $45MM in total gas V@R for an 
additional two weeks starting today.

Jeff, as per our meeting today, we may want to think about additional 
permanent increases for gas and power V@R particularily given the Alberta 
PPA's, the potential NStar deal and the current gas market as we enter the 
winter season.  I will take your lead on this one.

Subject: Bammel Storage Cushion Gas Issue.

I'm very disappointed and angry with comments that have been made since the 
HPL Asset Disposition Team realized the impact of what has been communicated 
to them over the last six weeks regarding the level of Bammel cushion gas 
that would be available on March 31, 2001.  The following is designed to set 
the record straight in the spirit of "Facts Are Friendly".  

First of all, it has been communicated multiple times over the last six - 
eight weeks to Patrick Wade and Brian Redmond and brought to the attention of 
Wes Colwell,  Dave Delainey and John Lavorato in the meeting held before year 
end to discuss the unwind cost.  All parties indicated that it was not a 
problem and that everyone was aware of the situation.  Now Im hearing just 
the opposite and in fact insinuations that the Storage Book screwed up by:  
1) originally booking injection and withdrawal assumptions down to 60 BCF.  
2) reversing the April, 2007 5.5 BCF injection assumption on December 31, 
2000. 
 1)  The decision to record injection / withdrawal assumption down to 60 BCF 
was made in 1992 by Kevin Hannon and Steve Smaby.  This was based on
         the fact that we had been down to 60 BCF physically in the several 
years proceeding 1992.  Since 1992 we have been down top 60 BCF twice, 
the          latest  being March, 1996.  Throughout this entire period the 
Accounting Dept was well aware of the Bammel assumptions and the 
physical           capabilities of the facility.  
 2)  The reversing of the Bammel assumptions has nothing to do with 
anything.  When we communicated the unwind cost of $203 million it included 
the         reversal of all assumptions including the April, 2007 injection.  
This was appropriate since we would be down to the 60 BCF physical minimum.  
In         addition we were told to make sure there was no Working Gas left 
in the ground.  If the reversal of the assumption was the problem then it 
could be         reversed, but then the unwind cost would go up.
It has also been suggested to me that I should have continued to follow up 
irregardless of the number of times I communicated the issue.  If I was 
dealing with lower level employee's I would agree, but given the level 
involved I feel this suggestion is totally out of line.  

From my perspective the only way I had a chance of catching this issue was if 
I had reveiwed all documents including the one specificly addressing the 
cushion gas of 65.5 BCF.   I beleive everyone on this memo was communicated 
to and was aware of the situation.  Perhaps they were involved with other 
issues related to the sell?  I am disappointed in the way everyone is scuring 
around to cover their backside.

Status of LIPA/Barges:   We are working in two directions.  Currently, we 
are:  

1. Finding a buyer for either the LIPA PPA/Barges together, or just the 
barges by themselves
2. Discussing with LIPA, the Power Desk, and BargeCo to find an acceptable 
PPA structure and barge price to meet our risk/return criteria.

The decision tree for the LIPA deal is as follows:

IF: The LIPA PPA can be structured to be unit contingent for energy,
   AND: The power desk can get comfortable with the capacity availability 
risk (discussions ongoing)
   AND: The economics of the deal are acceptable given the price for 
replacement capacity charged by the desk.
   AND: All permitting issues are either resolved or resolvable

OR,

IF: We can find an "as-is, where-is" buyer for the Barges with/without the 
PPA (ConEd, Montauk, NRG)

THEN: 
 ENA will purchase the barges from BargeCo (Barges are currently located in 
Brooklyn) 

ELSE: 
 We will not purchase the barges and will shut down the LIPA deal.    

 1. LIPA:  We will fall back on permitting issues and schedule to as a reason 
to stop working on the deal.

2. BargeCo:  The barges will have a lower performance than what was 
originally stated by BargeCo.  Additional capital investment would be 
required to meet our performance requirements - our position is that this 
additional cost must be borne by BargeCo.  We do not, however, want to 
implement this action until we have sold the 6B turbines to Enron Nigeria so 
that we are sure this transaction is completed.

Guys, what are we going to do with this contract and the barges?  My 
understanding is that we have a done deal on the 6B's.  Is this correct?  I 
may be a nervous nellie but I would like to put all this stuff behind us (ie) 
no more 6B's or barges.

Regards
Delainey

I wanted to let everyone know that Lavorato has organized a "trader boondoggle" for next weekend.  He has invited electricity traders with primary book responsibility from the east desk, west desk, ees wholesale, and alberta.  I was limited on both the job function of the people that could go as well as the total number from our desk that could go.  I know that many people would like to go on such a boondoggle.  I also feel that everyone here works hard and is equally committed to our success and arguably deserves such a boondoggle.  Unfortunately, I only received five slots for Portland west ena traders.

Next Friday morning Bob Badeer, Matt Motley, Mike Swerzbin, Mark Fischer, and I will be boarding a plane and heading to Cabo for the weekend.  We will be returning Sunday night and will be in the office for normal hours on Monday.

Dave,

Quick update.

It appears Art is on vacation all week.  He is obviously not too concerned about the issue.  I am still waiting to hear back from David Tang to see if they want one of their guys to go to the plant tomorrow.  

We could/should get FERC approval any day.  This is the last real CP for this deal.

Let me know if you and Cyrus hook up.

Thanks,

Don

Subject: EES Europe - Outsourcing Reorganisation

Introduction

EES has been operating in Europe since late 1999 and in that time a lot of 
progress has been made.  The teams who have worked on Outsourcing in Europe 
have learnt a tremendous amount over the last year.  We now have a much 
clearer idea of what should work today in the different jurisdictions that 
comprise Europe and those elements of our offering with which customers are 
most comfortable.

The phenomenally strong financial performance in 2000 of Enron Direct and 
ETOL graphically demonstrate the future potential in Europe for a broad 
retail energy business.  With Enron's retail energy presence in Europe firmly 
established, we are restructuring our Outsourcing product offering and the 
organisation to develop and deliver it, so that we broaden our activities and 
successfully grow our earnings in line with shareholder expectations.

We now have a renewed focus in 2001.  The emphasis will be to work on only 
the largest deals (by energy commodity spend) in those markets where we 
already have a robust wholesale energy business and there is regulated and 
economic third party access to retail power distribution systems.  The main 
thrust of our offering will be commodity and Demand Side Management (DSM) 
projects and our associated price risk management capabilities.  Commodity is 
Enron's core competence and one where Enron should be in a position to 
generate sizeable gross margin at closure.  DSM projects are also important 
as they will deliver gross margin and are what differentiate us from the 
commodity competition.  We will be focussing on shorter project lead times at 
the front of a deal to ensure that we get to closure promptly - we need to 
see 80% of the value in 20% of the time.  Whilst we retain an understanding 
of O&M, this will not form part of our core offering and we will only 
consider involvement in an O&M capacity on attractive margin transactions 
where it is essential to the customer.  As the business develops it is likely 
that, to some extent, we will build the necessary O&M delivery capability to 
enhance the product offering in the future.

In those markets where we have limited wholesale capability or the third 
party access to power distribution systems is not feasible in a retail 
context, we will build and develop Utility Representation Services (URS) in 
conjunction with a DSM project offering.  This knowledge based business will 
allow us to develop retail customer networks in advance of economic system 
access and also provide valuable market information back to the wholesale 
business.  URS is ERPAG's core business and gives us a tremendous platform to 
create a pan European URS competence.

Expertise in Supply Side Management has increasingly become an issue for the 
origination team in EES Europe as we have begun to get into material deal 
development.  Whilst it is vital that we remain totally coordinated with the 
wholesale business for price risk management services, there will be a 
renewed emphasis within EES Europe to develop those commodity skills that do 
not reside in the wholesale business to allow us to promptly and effectively 
price and structure retail commodity transactions to the delivery point.

Given the renewed focus outlined above, we have taken the opportunity to 
streamline the Account Delivery and Management team, typically redeploying 
staff where they can immediately support the development of new business for 
EES Europe.  Effective Account Management remains a key capability for EES 
and as we close deals with customers we will review our staffing need in this 
area.

Organisation

After eighteen months working on establishing the outsourcing business in 
Europe, Ron Bertasi has decided to transition back to the US during the first 
half of 2001.  In the short term he will complete the Trillium property deal 
and ensure that the energy and property deals are both successfully 
launched.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank Ron, on behalf of 
everyone in Europe, for all his hard work over the last eighteen months in 
establishing the European Outsourcing business and in particular his 
leadership on the Trillium deal which represents a substantial landmark for 
the business.

Stuart Rexrode is now head of European Energy Services Outsourcing.  Stuart 
will continue in a customer facing capacity as a lead originator, whilst 
ensuring that all of the dimensions that comprise the Outsourcing team remain 
appropriately focussed.  Bob Manasse will head up the origination team and 
ensure that the deal pipeline remains full of substantial good quality 
prospects.

Hala Tayyarah has been promoted to Manager within the Commodity team and will 
provide commodity pricing support to the origination team.  Hala will report 
to Peter Redpath until such time as a head of Supply Side Management is 
appointed.

Reporting to Peter Redpath, Peter Ramgolam will lead a new activity, 
Transaction Economics, supporting Origination by developing cashflow models 
to determine deal economics, identify improvements to structures to optimise 
value and capture transactions for risk management purposes.

Also reporting to Peter Redpath, John Parker will lead the implementation of 
a Position Management activity.

The attached organisation charts show these changes in the revised structure 
of EES Europe which is effective immediately.  Whilst these charts are 
relatively self explanatory for the levels shown, there will be detailed 
discussions over the next day or so to explain what the changes mean for 
individuals.  Where boxes are labelled TBA, we hope to make appointments in 
the near future.

At 10.30am on Monday 12th February we shall be holding a one hour EES-Europe 
all employee meeting in the Auditorium in place of the usual weekly staff 
meeting.  At this session we will talk about the 2001 Earnings Plan and 
provide clarity on the deal process for Outsourcing and the reasoning behind 
it.  Also, it will be an opportunity for you to raise any questions you may 
have.  I look forward to seeing you there.

Matthew

Dave,

It would be really great for you to do that.  Unfortunately we start at 
10.30am UK / 4.30am US time (the only slot we could get for the Auditorium).  
It won't be as cool as a video link up, but if you give me a text message 
addressed to all European staff, I'll read it out.

I'll get the senior guys together on Monday for the weekly EES 2.30pm UK / 
8.30am US video conference call so you and Janet can at least speak to them.

Let's get you and Janet over to Europe to meet and greet the troops in person

B'fast Friday looks fine, it's on the calendar!  

Re: the coal strategy, you're exactly right.  There is however one major 
impediment.  While locating the plant near/at the source (i.e., mine-mouth) 
will ease transport costs for coal, there aren't many major coal mines 
located in the prime market zones for power.  The transmission (wires) grid 
was not built to accomodate wholesale bulk trading/transport the way gas does 
and the impediments to expanding the grid are enormous (infinitely more so 
than building new plants).  For example, the average lead time to permit (not 
built, just permit) a high-voltage power line is 5-7 years!  As a result, a 
medium sized line (345kv, 200 miles) can cost upwards of $1-2 billion!  That 
was the most frustrating part of the 18 months I chased this stuff.  While 
the basic solutions appear to be so logical, the business (the utilities), 
regulatory and environmental regimes are so backwardated in their thinking 
that breaking in was basically impossible.  Unless we're willing to put a 
billion $ at risk for 5-7 years on a merchant basis!  (NOT!)  Hell, you can't 
even get $100 million for your refinery deal!  Solving the power supply 
shortage is only part of the equation and your coal idea is legitimate as new 
technology can burn coal almost as clean as gas.  But until the FERC and 
state PUCs force the issue of expanding the grid to become a more "fungible" 
and integrated transmission system, the utilities will continue to operate in 
their vacuum as these transmission barriers are the only things protecting 
their turfs.  Even though some have given the appearance of forming 
RTO's/ISO's (regional transmission organizations or independent system 
operators) this is simply a facade of utilities banding together to cover 
each other's asses.  The assets are still owned by the utilities themselves 
and the RTO/ISO has no authority to mandate expansion or anything requiring 
capital investment, other than routine maintenance, etc...  That's the whole 
genesis of what I was trying to preach to FERC, various utilities who 
"appeared" to be more forward thinking about dereg, etc...  Basically, you'd 
be trading one evil (transport for fuel) for another (transport for 
electrons) and I'm afraid the latter is infinitely more complex (engineering 
wise) and costly.

See ya' Friday!

brownfield opportunities - but I haven't heard of any developments.

Subject: coal plants

George,

I'm sure I am way over simplifying this, but in light of current natural gas 
prices and the past success ENA had building six natural gas power plants 
wouldn't the same template work for building coal fired power plants in the 
US? I'm sure the choosing of potential sites and the overall permitting 
process is far more severe than the natural gas process, but it would seem 
Enron could and should be a leader in proposing new coal plants. Wouldn't it 
make sense to build a state of the art coal power plant closer to the actual 
coal supply, whereby we avoid the ever increasing transportation costs and 
then supply power by wire to surrounding states. States rich in coal reserves 
are always looking for more jobs which a new power plant would create and 
therefore may speed the permitting process along. Building the power 
transmission infrastructure across state lines may be cost prohibitive, but 
has this approach been analyzed by the coal group? 

Regards,
Doug

Mark, The word on the street is that the NewPower folks are getting further in trouble (ie) strange trading activity, etc. Looks and smells a little like the old EES.

Couple of opps:
	- get another shareholder on-side and demand an Enron led audit to confirm financial and operating health;
	- followed up by hostile exit of mgt team if significant issues arise.

Issues:
	- obviously pushes us into another level of complicity/fiduciary in a blow up or bankruptcy not unlike the issues we faced with Kafus et al; however, given our continued interest a significant control issue could result in a significant acceleration of a write-off of our existing position plus any outstanding credit.

I would recommend we force the management team to submit to a detailed audit as a part of a united shareholder iniative - Lets discuss.

Rick Buy, what is our current credit position?

Greg/John, do you have a view on this one?

Rick Causey, we  probably need a more "permanent solution" ot the NewPower issue.

David,  

I hope all is well.  I had another good week at pulp and paper.  As you know 
I have an affinity for technology trading.  I thought you would enjoy the 
fine words below as you start a new week.  

Time is your most precious possession-and the hands of time move swiftly 
onward.  Fasten this warning deep into your mind, not for sorrow,s sake, but 
to remind yourself that today may be all you have.  Now is the time for you 
to move forward. Now is the time for you to stand and be counted.  The ground 
is now ready for you to plant the seeds of a new vision, one that will bear 
only the finest fruit.  It is time to focus on what you want, to turn dreams 
into realities so that you are able to spend your life in the manner in which 
you desire.  It is later than you think.    Too many of us waste our years 
waiting for better times in the future or reflecting upon better times in the 
past, instead of working for better times in the present.  --------------- If 
only we had better schooling, better opportunities, or better resources. 
If,if,if!  Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow!  
-------------------------------------

Today is always here; yesterday is gone; and tomorrow never comes.  Time 
offers opportunity but demands a sense of urgency.  Now is the time.  This is 
the place.  You are the one!

Those who leave a legacy of achievement master the art of living in the now- 
the ability to make each moment count.  Here are their tips.

? First, they accept each moment as a gift to be received with joy.
? Second, they use each moment to maximum advantage.
? Third, they are bent on making a contribution to humanity.
? Fourth, they learn from their mistakes.
? Fifth, they concentrate on the task at hand.
? Sixth, they plan for the future rather than fretting over the past.
? Seventh, they simply refuse to allow the weight of an unpleasant 
circumstance to encumber their thoughts or objectives.

                                                                              
               Dennis P. Kimbroa

I think technology is made up of a number of tradable commodities.  These 
commodities are volatile and trading them will add value to ENA.  I would 
like the opportunity to create this group.

Best wishes,

M. A. Moulton

Subject: Toronto Opportunity

Dave:

Just prior to the Holidays, I wrote an e-mail to Paul Devries (I copied you) 
that outlined how my experience could help the Toronto office expand 
business. As I indicated in my e-mail, my career interest, and my view of the 
needs of the Toronto office, is for a role that would look more like cash 
trading/services transaction management rather than pure coverage.  Paul and 
I agree that there is not enough happening in the cash trading/services area 
right now to warrant my move to Toronto.  We are hopeful that at some point 
within the next year, this will not be the case and Garrett Tripp will find 
himself too busy to effectively manage what needs to be done.  This probably 
will occur soon after market opening, rather than before.  At that time, I 
could be ready to go quickly.  If market conditions change so that my skills 
are not a real good fit, than we would not make the move.  I am confident I 
can stay abreast of Ontario market issues from Portland to limit any learning 
curve once a move happens.

I think Paul is comfortable with this plan.  He was going to run it by Rob.   
Please let me know if you are OK with this plan as well.

Thanks again for the consideration.

Chris

2.    Sales Practices -- this training has been completed in Portland and is 
being scheduled in Houston and Calgary.

3.    Anti-manipulation -- this training has been completed in Portland, but 
needs to be expanded to cover local law manipulation issues.  It also needs 
to be scheduled in Houston and Calgary. 

Also, the above training needs to be supplemented with training on local

vest based upon 60MW of orders;
  - discussion with FCEL in which we disclose ALL infromation we have about 
the potential Conn. deal - I will require that myself and Mark be on   that

 CRRA: - subject to final due diligence on the development risks, we provide

opportunity that consists of between 25 and 50 MW;
  - any appropriation of funds from the government will require DPUC hearing 
at which we will fully disclose in a factual manner our interest in    FCEL.

I will require that Mark Haedicke manage this process and sign off on all 
press releases, term sheets, disclosure discussions, contracts and regulatory

manage the process as per the script and in a factual manner.

Guys, in coordination with your trading partners, can you start putting 
together your offsite presentations.  Each group will have approximately one 
hour to one hour and half.  A suggested format would include (for East Power, 
East Gas, West Power, Canada (power and gas), Central Gas and West Gas):
  a) market overview - including supply/demand, structural changes, etc;
  b) strategy and opportunities in 2001(include five new trading/origination 
opportunities for 2001);
  c) expected 2001 new products/structures, coverage and deal flow;
  d) what worked in 2000 what didn't;
  and e) organization and resources - people, assets, constraints, etc.

In a nutshell, we want you to share with the group how your market works, 
where the opportunties lie and how are you positioning yourself to take 
advantage of those opportunties in order to reach your financial and other 
goals in 2001.  

Tammy Sheppard and Dorie Hitchcock will coordinate and do a lot of the heavy 
lifting; however, they need your first cut by December 8th.

Thanks

expense it in Canada - it will be an explainable variance for this year and

Rob, further to our conversation. I have had attached a couple of the notes 
recently sent to the PR group.  Historically, the expense for this 
advertising has been paid by the Houston. The overall expense item was not 
that large and Corp was paying because generally they were not supporting any 
other expense in Calgary and deemed this request reasonable.  If possible I 
would ask that you secure approval from Delainey with regards to the renewal 
of this item.



Needless to say, this Flame has been a flagship for Enron in the Hockey 
community and our association with the Flames ownership committee does not go 
unnoticed !

Please let me know if you need anything but our basic request is corporate 
approval to reimburse canada for the next 3 years @ approx. $ 50,000.00 
US/year. 

Thanks in advance, Barry

Barry -- While PR can approve the look and feel of the sign, the cost would 
have to be approved by ENA Chairman's office.  Generally, it has been my

from its own budget.  As I am no longer working in the PR group, it would be

We have negotiated a 3 year deal with the Calgary Flames.  Can you please 
verify via e-mail that ECC will be reimbursed by ENA for this annual 
advertising expense.  Upon receipt of the invoice, we will process payment 
and coordinate this on your behalf. 

Nov 2000 - Nov 2001        $68,000 + 7 % Tax = $72,760. / $ 1.47 ( Currency 
).  Approx. $ 50,000.00 US/Year advertising expense.

will also coordinate the execution of all documents regarding legal 
liability, renewal rights etc.

Subject: ESA's LM 6000's

Guys, although I am hesitant to get in between ESA and ENA on this issue, my 
perception is that there is some confusion; we need to sort out at the top.  
Let me describe what I understand of the facts.  

First, ESA is coordinating a DASH through the RAC for eight LM 6000's.

Second, ENA has a list of 24 LM 6000's; the "ready to ship date" as shown on 
the following attachment; but only four of these are earmarked for ESA, as 
far as I understand.

Third, GE/S&S has approached me and is willing to sell us more LM 6000's if 
we need to.  The "ready to ship dates" for these new LM 6000's are between 
January - March, 2001.  We could possibly get these at the current preferred 
pricing (as a current contract change order).

ESA and ENA should discuss whether or not either party wants to buy some of 
the new LM 6000's that are now available for delivery between January - 
March, 2001.  Does ENA want to substitute any of these for LM 6000's 
currently on hand and not allocated to ESA?  Is ENA earmarking four 
additional LM 6000's on the attached list to ESA, and if so, which ones?  If 
not, does ESA want EECC to secure any or all of the remaining units required, 
which we can do quickly, off the balance sheet.

My perception is that there is confusion and not clear direction, I recommend 
that both of you have a discussion and establish a clear definition of what 
we are doing with the LM 6000's and whether either of you want to entertain 
the purchase of the new LM 6000's.  Let me know if I can help.

Guys, I appreciate the quality work and deal flow that you are generating.  
In an effort to measure and reward performance from our middle market groups 
we have attempted to come up with several standardized reports to be issued 
monthly and to be reviewed at the QBR.  I am a strong believer in that what 
is measured and rewarded gets done.  As well, the middle market capability is 
crucial to the continued growth of our business; therefore, reporting metrics 
which define high performance will ensure great deal makers get rewarded and 
that  you will be able to attract high quality talent into the mid market 
groups.  Baughman and Presto have created a number of reports and metrics for 
the East Power group, I would like you to take a look and let me know how 
they should be changed to reflect the business in the West.  Upon agreement 
on the metrics, I would like issue these reports on a monthly basis.

Tammy Sheppherd will get you a copy of the reports/metrics utilized in the 
East.

Dave/John:

As you know, EPMI West recently has closed numerous longer-dated transactions 
(through 2002 and beyond) with munis and other direct counterparties (not 
marketers).  Several of these resulted due to close coordination between the 
Originator from Chris Calger's Group, the Middle Marketer and the Trader, 
each with a different role, working out the split of origination to 
everyone's satisfaction. Tim Belden (see below) thought you might be 
interested in the attached spreadsheet listing some of these key deals done 
this year.  

Please let me know if you want further details on the transactions 
(503/464-3822).

Thanks!

FYI, Ken we may want you to speak to Peevey and Freeman.  I believe that 
discussion should frame the proposal and attempt to set up a meeting with his 
staff and advisors to answer questions about credit and documentation.  In 
the propsal, we have tried to frame the potential credit and legal holes in 
their RFP with our suggested language or documents.  It would be helpful for 
the commercial team in ENA/EES to meet with these gentlemen and their 
advisors to describe the proposal and perhaps move towards negotiating a 
transaction.

 The proposal includes:
  a) traded power products of various sizes and terms;
  b) unit contigent tolls from Pastoria (750MW) and Las Vegas Cogen (222MW) 
for term;
  c) natural gas packages for size for one through five year terms to provide 
gas hedges for their QF portfolio or other contracted merchant toll contracts;
  and d) an preliminary proposal on DSM from EES.

I will forward an executive summary from Chris Calger with more detail.

Ken, in response to your note, I am not aware of any official dialogue with 
Mr. Kase Lawal about a potential sale of Mariner or with the economics of the 
aborted IPO.  His $250 M valuation may have been appropriate 12 to 18 months 
ago.  However, Mariner has enjoyed a series of successful wells that are 
expected to be booked in reserve reports next March not to mention 
significant increases in gas and oil prices.  Our current valuations, in the 
$600M range is a stretch target but not incredibly out of line given reserve 
growth and current energy prices.  Our current goal, is to be able to 
demonstrate three to four quarters of increasing operating cashflow and 
reserves growth before attempting a private sale mid next year to a 
significant E&P concern that desires an offshore division.  The 
concentration, operating and exploration risk implicit in Mariner make it a 
very poor IPO candidate ((ie) I'm not sure that an IPO was ever a viable 
strategy to maximize the exit value).

I would recommend that we not meet to make the following points:
 a) Mariner is not on the market at this point in time and
 b)  his un-solicited offer does not warrant serious attention.

Otherwise, we would be glad to speak to him in the future if we decide to 
sell tha asset.

I hope this meets with your approval.

B'fast Friday looks fine, it's on the calendar!  

Re: the coal strategy, you're exactly right.  There is however one major 
impediment.  While locating the plant near/at the source (i.e., mine-mouth) 
will ease transport costs for coal, there aren't many major coal mines 
located in the prime market zones for power.  The transmission (wires) grid 
was not built to accomodate wholesale bulk trading/transport the way gas does 
and the impediments to expanding the grid are enormous (infinitely more so 
than building new plants).  For example, the average lead time to permit (not 
built, just permit) a high-voltage power line is 5-7 years!  As a result, a 
medium sized line (345kv, 200 miles) can cost upwards of $1-2 billion!  That 
was the most frustrating part of the 18 months I chased this stuff.  While 
the basic solutions appear to be so logical, the business (the utilities), 
regulatory and environmental regimes are so backwardated in their thinking 
that breaking in was basically impossible.  Unless we're willing to put a 
billion $ at risk for 5-7 years on a merchant basis!  (NOT!)  Hell, you can't 
even get $100 million for your refinery deal!  Solving the power supply 
shortage is only part of the equation and your coal idea is legitimate as new 
technology can burn coal almost as clean as gas.  But until the FERC and 
state PUCs force the issue of expanding the grid to become a more "fungible" 
and integrated transmission system, the utilities will continue to operate in 
their vacuum as these transmission barriers are the only things protecting 
their turfs.  Even though some have given the appearance of forming 
RTO's/ISO's (regional transmission organizations or independent system 
operators) this is simply a facade of utilities banding together to cover 
each other's asses.  The assets are still owned by the utilities themselves 
and the RTO/ISO has no authority to mandate expansion or anything requiring 
capital investment, other than routine maintenance, etc...  That's the whole 
genesis of what I was trying to preach to FERC, various utilities who 
"appeared" to be more forward thinking about dereg, etc...  Basically, you'd 
be trading one evil (transport for fuel) for another (transport for 
electrons) and I'm afraid the latter is infinitely more complex (engineering 
wise) and costly.

See ya' Friday!

Subject: coal plants

George,

I'm sure I am way over simplifying this, but in light of current natural gas 
prices and the past success ENA had building six natural gas power plants 
wouldn't the same template work for building coal fired power plants in the 
US? I'm sure the choosing of potential sites and the overall permitting 
process is far more severe than the natural gas process, but it would seem 
Enron could and should be a leader in proposing new coal plants. Wouldn't it 
make sense to build a state of the art coal power plant closer to the actual 
coal supply, whereby we avoid the ever increasing transportation costs and 
then supply power by wire to surrounding states. States rich in coal reserves 
are always looking for more jobs which a new power plant would create and 
therefore may speed the permitting process along. Building the power 
transmission infrastructure across state lines may be cost prohibitive, but 
has this approach been analyzed by the coal group? 

Regards,
Doug

Dave

In response to your e mail, this is meant to update you on the status of the 
search for potential coal fired generation sites.

We have used the following criteria to screen potential sites east of the 
Mississippi including the following:

 Underutilized existing coal fired generation (15 sites)
 Existing coal fired generation that is on cold stand by (12 sites)
 Coal units that have been retired (20 sites)
 Coal fired units that at one time had planned coal unit additions that were 
delayed or cancelled (11 sites)
 Undeveloped sites that had planned to build coal units (13 sites)
 Undeveloped sites that had planned to build nuclear units (5 sites)

We are in the process of prioritizing each site based on infrastructure, 
transmission access, market and permit status. That effort should be 
concluded this week and the study forwarded to you. We are also talking with 
two coal operators that are in the process of developing their own coal fired 
generation in Kentucky and West Virginia.

We will keep you apprised of the progress and meet with you again as we move 
to the next stage.

Body:
Here is my first cut at taking the existing budget numbers to a desk-level.  Here are the key assumptions behind my cost allocations:
Direct costs for each group went to that group.
Gas Ops was allocated to Houston gas.
Power Ops was allocated to East and West Power based on commercial headcount.
Most other costs were allocated to Gas, East Power, West Power, Canada, OOC based on commercial headcount.
There are a hundred ways you could do this exercise, I'm not saying that this is the right way, but at least I was able to break the costs down.

I then calculated an EBIT by desk, funded a bonus pool, paid bonuses to all the non-commercial people, and figured out what a bonus pool would look like by desk based on the proforma values.  I am not necessarily saying that this is the way that we should do it, but I think that it is one way to view the world upon which we can make whatever changes/adjustments we deem necessary.  Here are my initial conclusions / reactions:
The proforma produces bonuses for commercial employees equal to roughly 6% of their gross margin.
This number is high relative to the 1-2% we are used to, but considerably lower than the 8% to 12% that appears to be available in the market.
Our costs are way too high.  For every dollar of direct commercial expenses there are four dollars of allocations.  That just seems way out of hand.
This model sells with lower costs.  With current costs, I have a hard time convincing people in Portland that this looks good relative to people's alternatives.

I think that we need to have a lot of discussions next week on how this new organization would be managed.  I don't see why we couldn't debate, if not nail down, a bunch of things next week.  For example:
How do we allocate VAR to the best performing traders and the market that offers the best opportunity at the time?
Do we need to incent desk heads based on netco earnings while compensate traders based on desk earnings?
How will we carve up the bonus pool?  What are our choices?  What gets the VAR to the right places and properly incents teamwork?
How do we best manage costs?  How do we send appropriate cost signals for sunk costs?  For variable costs?
We need a very strong, professional, operations manager who is steeped in cost accounting, efficiency, quality control, and leadership.  There is a science to operations management that I haven't seen applied at Enron.  For example, what does it cost us to schedule a MW - average and marginal?  What does it cost us to run a book?  What does it cost us to settle transactions?
What package are we going to be able to offer to incent people to stay?  When can we start talking about it?  Who should we discuss this with?
What does our management team look like?  Is it three people?  Five people? Ten people?

I want to make this thing work.  My clear first choice for 2002 is to be on this team.  I want to be as contructive and helpful as possible in achieving this end.  I can't commit unequivically (sp?) until we sort out all of the numbers, I feel like I can sell this to the Portland team, and I know what comp looks like for me and the key people in Portland.  I feel like some adjustments to the proforma and a clear understanding of 2002 comp will probably get us there.

When do you want me in Houston (for a visit - not to move)?

Tim

Subject: Re: Fort James Amortization  

I try to run clean, conservative books.  To that end, I assessed every single 
originated transaciton when I took over the group in 1999.  Edith Cross and I 
turned over every rock that we could find, booked things properly, and moved 
on.  I know nothing about this amortization that's been going on.  Perhaps 
there were two payments to Fort James -- one being the payment that west 
power trading expensed in 1997 associated with the in money Wauna/Halsey 
position and the other associated with the overall alliance.  West Power 
Trading very clearly liquidated the payment associated with Wauna/Halsey in 
1997.  I have the DPR from March of 1997 to prove it.  If this payment was 
capitalized for some reason after West Power Trading expensed it, then I'm 
not sure what to do.  It seems odd for us to pay for the same bad position 
twice.  

If the amortization is associated with the second payment to Fort James -- 
the alliance payment -- then we have a different kettle of fish entirely.  I 
don't understand why it was ok for the amotization to hit the industrial 
group but when we do a one-time amortization of the balance it all of a 
sudden switches over to the West Power Trading group.  How come last month it 
was "proper" for the charge to hit the industrial group and this month it is 
"proper" for the charge to hit West Power Trading.  The charge should hit 
whoever's rc it was who thought that paying Fort James a bunch of money was a 
good idea.  If that person is no longer around the charge should either hit 
that person's successor or it should hit a management book.

To your point about who benefits from the termination of this deal.  Clearly, 
it is a good idea to terminate these deals and remove bad positions with a 
lot of uncertainty from the West Power Trading books.  Having said that, I 
have a hard time feeling good about the "benefit" that West Power Trading has 
received from these deals.  In 1999 I was told that this was largely a legal 
question.  A memo written by Jake Thomas on April 7, 1999 memorializes this 
line of thought.  We established a $500k legal reserve, rebooked the deals, 
took most of the positive value to the book to offset large losses associated 
with other old deals and granted the remainder, about $1 million, to Jake in 
origination.  The entity that has benefited the most from these deals is West 
Origination.

Finally, I can't see how this expense belongs to West Power Trading.  I would 
like to understand how all of the accounting worked before I can accept an 
expense on my rc.  If you want to deal with the expense separately and have a 
discussion about granting origination for terminating this deal then let's do 
that.  That discussion needs to reflect history, and include the origination 
that was granted in 1997, 1999, and include the legal reserve of $500k.

Give me a call when you get a chance.

Subject: Fort James Amortization

Tim, my understanding is that partnership fee (the $11.0M) has been amortized 
for the last several years and expensed to the Industrial groups (McConville 
and Ondarza).  As you are aware, I sued them for breach.  The settlement 
involved the elimination of all existing transactions between Ft. James and 
Enron including the Wauna and Halsey power contracts.  It is my understanding 
that the benefit of the elimination of those shorts resides in the Portland 
shop.   The elimination of the shorts would not have occurred without the 
lawsuit on the alliance and the settlement I originated.  It seemed logical 
to charge the Portland office with the remaining un-amortized fee of $1.8M as 
a cost of eliminating the shorts for no cost and no future contingent 
liability.

Lets discuss.

Subject: Fort James Amortization

Edith Cross and I looked at the Fort James deal in great detail in early 
1999.  When the deal was closed, west power trading booked an in the money 
position and an offsetting expense of about $11 million.  This money has 
already liquidated from our book.  In fact, I have a copy of the 3/31/97 DPR 
that reflects this liquidation.  At that time, west power trading also paid a 
350k credit reserve, 247k to the finance book, and 1.3 million in 
origination.  

I have also heard about a "partnership" fee that Enron paid to Fort James 
around the same time.  I'm not sure what this fee was and who benefitted from 
it.  It had nothing to do with the west power trading book.

On John's recommendation I called Wes to see if we could figure this out.  
Wes, please give me a call back to discuss.  I think that someone needs to 
look at the actual journal entries from March of 1997 to see why an expense 
of $11 million was deferred.

This is not my problem.  I should not receive this expense.  Until this is 
resolved, I would greatly appreciate it if the writedown of the deferred 
account does not hit west power trading's expenses.

Jeff,

My name is Samuel Pak, and I'm an Analyst in the A/A program.  I will also be riding the MS150 with you and the Team this weekend.  As I did last year, I am writing an article on the MS150 for the Encounter.  As such, I was hoping that maybe we could chat a few minutes at lunch in Bellville or at dinner in La Grange.  If this is OK with you, I will find you and introduce myself, and we can go from there.

Much Thanks!
Sam.

Rob, we may be saying the same thing here - for the EES outsourcing 
proposition (which is more than just asset management) as being defined by 
Rodney et al should be managed together by Industrial Origination and ECC.  
Although, I would agree that ECC should lead the sale process.  My view is 
that we should not and will not recreate the structuring, customer facing and 
execution requirements in Canada and Mexico required to do these deals. It is 
an important strategic iniative for ENA to complete a number of these deals. 
The problem is that a clear target list, joint accountabilities and schedule 
between the groups has not been rolled out which was discussed at Columbia 
Lakes.  All other industrial business other than P&P commodity/asset business 
is the perview of ECC.

Ultimately, I have not seen any outsourcing transactions from Canada in the 
deal structuring/due diligence queue.  The US group can help get these done 
and can help in the pitch.

Subject: Re: Tembec and US Originators  

Dave, my thoughts regarding your note:

This is not what we agreed to in Columbia Lakes. You were very clear on the 
point that ENA Industrial Marketing had enough to do South of the border. We 
have staffed up our Industrial Marketing Team in Toronto and are covering all 
industrials (on a full-time basis) which meet our load threshold in Ontario. 
Unlike the U.S., Ontario is a relatively small market where we can and have 
complete coverage. Paul and his group have done a tremendous job at 
positioning Enron in this marketplace, demonstrating our core competencies, 
and developing credibility. The last thing I want is some marketer up here 
from the U.S. selling the box without knowing how to fill that box (ie does 
not know the market fundamentals, rules or regulatory regime). This does 
nothing for Enron as it confuses the customer on who they should be talking 
to and destroys whatever credibility we had created to date. I have attached 
for your reference, a status report on industrial coverage.

Perhaps the problem lies in how we are defining outsourcing. As you know, 
there exists a continuum from portfolio management through to the energy 
island concept. Enron Canada has been pitching the entire outsourcing 
continuum recognizing that for many of these industrials, they will want to 
walk before they run. The majority that we have talked to are interested in 
portfolio management, our market expertise & information, wholesale 
settlement services, and assistance with market opening readiness. I cant 
imagine how a U.S. originator could talk to or offer these services to 
Canadian Industrials. This is clearly in Enron Canada's wheelhouse.

With respect to the opposite side of the outsourcing continuum, it makes 
total sense to have ENA utilize its resources in pursuing energy island, 
asset outsourcing type structures. With these opportunities, I see ENA taking 
the lead with ECC second chair. Where these opportunities are identified by 
ECC, we will forward these to the appropriate ENA originator. To date, ENA 
and ECC have worked well on Blue Circle, Terra, Co-Steel and Nexfor.

As for Tembec, I am confused with what you mean by not changing the deal 
team. Kelli Metcalf has been up here twice talking to Tembec about a cogen in 
an area that does not make any economic sense. Jan and Paul have met with 
Tembec a number of times and we have had extensive discussions with Tembec 
specific to Ontario, Portfolio Management, Wholesale Settlement Services, 
Supply Procurement, and Asset Optimization. I realize that Bryan Burnett has 
an excellent relationship with Tembec and we should leverage off of this, but 
to simply "keep ECC in the loop" is fundamentally absurd and is not in 
Enron's best interests.

Milnthorp

Subject: Tembec and US Originators

Guys, to end all arguments, I would suggest the following protocol which is 
similar to what was discussed at Columbia Lakes:

 a) P&P swaps and anything to do with the network strategy/assets in the 
paper sector in Canada and Mexico - Industrial Origination;
 b) Pure energy commodity positions and stand-alone energy assets (no 
outsourcing) for all industrial segments in Canada and Mexico - ECC or Enron 
Mexico; 
 c) Energy outsourcing for all industrial segments in Canada and Mexico - I 
would like Enron Canada and Enron Mexico to develop a written target list in 
which ECC, Enron Mexico and the Industrial Origination groups would work 
together to develop, sell and execute on the most profitable and value adding 
outsourcing product for the industrial customer in Canada and Mexico - ECC 
and Enron Mexico's understanding of the energy markets in Canada and Mexico 
coupled with the customer facing, product development and execution skills in 
Houston should provide a winning team.  I am asking for the three teams to 
clearly identify the outsourcing targets, lead sales and structuring people 
and the timing as far as starting discussion with each target customer 
(ASAP).  I would hope that the Mexican and Canadian teams would lead the 
sales process and the Houston team lead the structuring, customer facing and 
execution but I will let you decide the optimum mix.  Either way, I am 
expecting this target list completed and agreed to in the next two weeks for 
Canada and Mexico;
 and d) for Tembec I don't think it makes sense to change the deal team at 
this point; however, the US team will keep the Canadian team in the loop and 
if the products become non-outsourcing related the deal should be passed to 
ECC.

Subject: Tembec and US Originators

Rodney, Edward, Jim - We've been over this issue a number of times and I 
thought we had reached resolution when we last met with Delainey.  My 
understanding with respect to coverage of Canadian Industrials is as follows:

1.) ENA to take lead on industrials that have facilities in both US and 
Canada and will co-ordinate coverage with ECC with respect to Canadian 
Facilities.

2.) ECC to take lead on industrials that have Canadian Facilities only.

3.) With respect to Canadian Pulp & Paper Industrials, ENA will cover Pulp & 
Paper Swaps and SPV structuring.  ECC will cover these industrials for all 
other Enron products (i.e. power, gas, services, etc.) Again, coverage needs 
to be co-ordinated.

Specific to Tembec, I share Paul's concerns on why ENA would send 2 people to 
talk to Tembec re: outsourcing when Tembec is across the hall from ECC, ECC 
has an established relationship, and Tembec is a Canadian Company with no US 
facilities.

It is my hope that we can resolve this amongst ourselves without having to 
get Dalainey involved. I would suggest a conference call next week.  In the 
interim, Paul will forward a CA to Tembec in contemplation of an outsourcing 
arrangement.

Subject: Tembec and US Originators

Rob, We just had a very good meeting with Tembec about Energy procurement and 
energy outsourcing.  While the meeting went well, I am very confused about 
the Enron team making the pitch to them.  My understanding is that the 
Canadian originators - particularly the Toronto team for Eastern Canadian 
companies will be responsible for everything except for pulp and paper swaps 
and to some extent, new SPV's.

In this instance,

1.  Tembec is a Canadian Company
2.  All their assets are in Canada
3.  Jan has been working with Tembec people in their largest facility
4.  We know the executive team at Tembec
5.  We clearly are very knowleadgable in all aspects of the Ontario energy 
market which is their focus right now
6.  We understand and are pitching the overall energy outsourcing arrangement 
similar to the US pitches

With this in mind, I am not sure why Kellie Metcalf and Bob Anderson flew up 
here (6 hours flight time there and back, $4,000 to $5,000 in flights and 
hotels) for a 4 hour meeting with Tembec.  Kelly was quite vocal in saying 
that this is a client they want to serve out of Houston.  I have stated to 
her that that does not make any sense in terms of efficiency and costs and 
knowledge of the market where Tembec's assets are.  Obviously, much of the 
technical engineering work would and should be done by the engineering team 
put together in the Industrial Services Group should a deal be struck.  
However, the commercial negotiations and marketing should be led by this 
office!!!

I thought this had been agreed to already.  We managed to piece up the 
meeting and deliver the "Enron" message, but going forward we need to have 
this resolved.


Cheers, Paul D

Mr. Lay:
It was good to see you down on the trading floor today.  I have been in the power trading group for about a year now.  I came over from the corp. development group after we sold the peakers to Allegheny and to Cinergy.  I was the one who convinced my Dad to buy those two peakers.
The power trading group is a really solid group of individuals.  Sitting where I do I see and hear alot of what goes on in the heart on Enron and I feel that this part of the company is doing really well.  
I have been with Enron for over four years now and I continue to learn alot as well as contribute to Enron's bottom line.  Eventhough Enron's stock price has come off a little I still think this is a great company and that the overall fundamentals are very sound.  I hope all is going well!

Subject:	Associate/Analyst Program	Date:	August 22, 2001	

As most of you know, Jeff Skilling created the Associate/Analyst Program in 1990.  This Program is one of his most successful and important contributions to Enron, and will continue as a cornerstone of the Company.  It remains our single most important source of new talent.

The purpose of this memo is to reassure you that the direction, philosophy, and importance of the Program remains unchanged.  As we have said many times, most of our new businesses were created by graduates and members of the Program.  Many of the current leaders of our company are also graduates of the Program.

Three broad principles will continue to guide the direction of the Program.
?	We will have only one Associate/Analyst Program at Enron, and it is a Company asset.
?	We will have a "One Enron" presence on campus to provide clarity of message and purpose.
?	The Program is rotational in nature, and will prepare our future leaders for success by providing exposure to Enron's network of people and systems.

The business prospects for Enron, and the opportunities for personal growth and development have never been better.  We also enjoy the deepest and broadest talent pool we have ever had.  Each and every one of you can be a key contributor to making Enron the World's Leading Company.

Janet, between you, Laura and Frank/Gil you should  be able to field a one 
Enron team on this one.  I am at your disposal otherwise.

Laura/Frank - this is an important one for the team - please work together 
constructively.  Gil should continue in his current role as main relationship 
manager unless you guys change your mind.

Regards
Delainey

Subject: Keyspan 


Quick update on Keyspan:  Gil Muhl flew to New York yesterday to spend the 
afternoon with Chuck Devario. It sounds like their meeting went very well as 
they spent a few hours discussing Keyspan's situation in the Northeast market 
and how an Enron/Keyspan "JV" would work. They actually outlined a lot of 
ideas on the white board and it basically sounds like Chuck is very 
interested in pursuing this JV that would focus on optimizing Keyspan's gas, 
power, and fuel oil portfolios. Chuck is now planning to come to Houston in 
mid-January to sit down with us and further these discussions. If the Houston 
visit goes well we will then plan to take him to Chicago to show him 
first-hand the Enron/People's JV (trading floor, office set-up, discussion of 
general contractual arrangements between the reg. utility and unreg. 
affiliate, etc.). Chuck knows Tom Patrick and it would be a great way to show 
him how well our Chicago JV has worked for both People's and Enron. Obviously 
this visit and meeting will need to be tightly finessed but I'm confident 
that with Laura Luce/Bill Morrow and Gil, Chuck, and myself, it will work.

We may want to consider getting out with Keyspan and People's together in a 
more social setting sometime in March (maybe the Master's would work). I 
think Keyspan has the ability to get out of the Coral relationship early if 
they really wanted to (it currently goes through April, 2002) although I 
think it will probably take the better part of next year to formulate the 
entire structure around this JV. I think the potential is to have a 
commercial structure in place and effective going into next winter or 
coinciding with the termination of the Keyspan/Coral relationship in April 
2002.

Okay, now the players needed to make this happen....Gil needs to be 
intimately involved. His knowledge of that market and company and his 
relationship with Devario, Anderson, Fazio, the operational folks, etc. is 
extremely good. If you decide that you do not want to have Gil involved in 
this (not a good decision) you need to move him out of his current role. 
Given the fact that we are using the People's JV as a showcase, Laura Luce 
can be very closely connected to Gil and Keyspan in a very natural and 
genuine way. Gil will need to lean on Laura's expertise in how she set up the 
Chicago JV throughout the process. I plan to insert Michael Brown into the 
deal team to focus on the power and fuel oil components. Michael has 
excellent relationships with all the folks at Keyspan and his knowledge of 
Keyspan's power portfolio and that power market will be critical. Ed 
McMichael will lead all the structuring effort (gas and maybe power too), and 
we'll need Bob Superty from the  operational side. 


Although it is still unclear as to whether Keyspan will decide to request 
proposals from several players, it is clear that with our overall 
capabilities and genuine desire to be flexible on the commercial structure in 
what we put together with them, Chuck Devario is very interested in pursuing 
more detailed discussions in the very near future.
 
I'd like you to be available to spend some time with Chuck and I when he 
comes to Houston in January ( maybe  a late morning meeting and lunch) and 
I'll coordinate with Kay on that.

Let me know if you want to talk about this ahead of time. I'll be here all 
next week.

Last week was the hardest week that our office has ever experienced.  When I look down the list of people who were laid off I see the names of some very talented people.  Things have unfolded so quickly -- the reality of the situation is settling in for me, and probably many of us, today.

Subject: Communicating with Risk

A couple of things happened yesterday where communicating with our risk team 
could have saved them a lot of time.  I have asked the risk group to put 
together a list of things they need to know from us each day;  until we 
distribute the definitive list, this e-mail should serve as a reminder that 
more communication is much better than less.

First, you need to hear about how a simple little thing can cause our risk 
systems to blow up.  My goal is not to point a finger, but rather to 
highlight the fact that we need to be thinking about the risk group any time 
we change something in Enpower.  Yesterday, somebody on the short term 
california desk entered a 1 MW deal for 1 hour with the wrong delivery 
point.  The delivery point was somewhere in the eastern US.  The deal was 
promptly changed, but not before the east desk had "calced" their books.  
When the west risk group attempted to "calc" our books, the system found a 
deal (the same 1 MW deal) that had already been "calced" by the east.  The 
result was that the portcalc blew up and there was no way to know why.  The 
technology group in Houston worked through the night to figure it out.  Our 
risk group was here until about 11 PM trying to figure it out.  Finally, the 
problem was discovered this morning.  The result was that we didn't publish a 
preliminary P&L last night and we didn't have correct positions this 
morning.  On top of that, people who are already overworked had to put in 
long hours.  IN THE FUTURE, IT IS YOUR JOB TO COMMUNICATE INFORMATION -- 
LARGE OR SMALL -- TO THE RISK GROUP.  It is impossible to know what types of 
things may cause problems.  Therefore, I can't prescribe exactly what has to 
be communicated.  Obviously, you don't need to tell them about every deal 
that you have entered, but you need to tell them about any changes to deals.  
Try to communicate too much.  Let them tell you when it is too much 
information.

Another area of communication that must be improved concerns long term 
deals.  The interest rate group needs to know about material changes in cash 
flows in the future.  Our risk group currently communicates this information 
to the interest rate group.  If we don't tell them, they can't tell the 
interest rate group, and the interest rate group yells at our risk group.  
Nobody likes to get yelled at.  Yesterday, we did a couple of long term deals 
with BPA in the 2002 to 2006 timeframe.  Nobody on the desk communicated this 
to the risk group.  In the future, please communicate any deal that is longer 
than a year to the risk group.

Again, my goal is not to chastise the people who caused the problems 
yesterday.  We had no idea that changing a small deal could blow up our 
system.  But going forward, I am going to be really mad if our lack of 
internal communication leads to uneccessary work and/or headaches for others 
on the floor.  All of our lives will be much better if we communicate more.

Thanks for your attention to this matter,
Tim

Guys, as a follow up to our meeting today, I thought I would put together a 
list of deliverables agreed to in the meeting.  The goal would be to have a 
definitive strategy for HPL and storage assets by the end of July that could 
be acted upon.

 a) Elimination of the Entex contract - current value - John L.;
 b) Storage value algorithm incorporating spread values, increasing intra-day 
and monthly volatility and blowdown values - Jean M, John L, Jim S.;
 c) Storage acquisition targets and issues surrounding value/execution - top 
5 to 10 for blowdown and tarantula strategy - Jean M, Julie G.;
 d) Structure, value, cost and issues surrounding Bammel "header" - Jean M.;
 e) Project Torque - definitive balance sheet, income statement and 
contribution margin statement for HPL - Wes C.;
 f) Establish viability of selling HPL assets - small private placement - 
working with Lehman to finalize value, exection risk, timing, structure et al 
- Patrick   W.
 
 I would like this group to get back together in the fourth week of July to 
determine a final action plan.

Regards
Delainey

It looks as though this will work quite easily now as the breakfast Ken originally had scheduled will not take place.  I received word from Sue Landwehr that it will be cancelled as it was Republican Governors and they will not now be here.  We'll coordinate an exact time tomorrow.
 
Thanks.

Dear Mr. Lay, 

I understand that Cindy Olson talked with you about the harassment prevention training scheduled over the next few weeks.  In past classes, a senior-level business person has emphasized that harassment is not tolerated and is not consistent with Enron's values.   

For this set of training classes, the team asked if you could deliver that message via videotape.  Cindy told me that your answer is "yes." 

I understand that you are scheduled to record an unrelated video on Thursday morning, and that it might be possible to tape this message at the end of that session.  Would that work with your schedule?  If so, I will provide you with talking points and a script.  If another time is better for you, let me know.

Thanks for your help!

Michelle Cash

The Stanford Business School, in collaboration with the management-consulting firm McKinsey & Company, is conducting a large study of global corporations, their management practices, and organization.  Enron is participating in the project in order to learn how our own practices and activities compare to those of other leading global firms and to see which bring true benefits in the global marketplace.  One of the unique features of the project is that it seeks to assess the knowledge and communication networks within a company by asking employees throughout the company to comment on their actual practices and experience.  The goal is to obtain real and accurate information by surveying the people most directly involved in the company's operations. 

I would like to ask you to help us in getting the most out of our participation in the GLOBE Initiative by completing the GLOBE Network Survey.  The survey is brief and should take no longer than 15 or 20 minutes.  Your responses will be treated as strictly confidential, and will be used solely by the Stanford/McKinsey researchers to evaluate how specific practices and structures impact global communication and knowledge flows.  If you would like individual feedback on how your own networks compare to those of others in the study, please check the appropriate box at the end of the survey.  

Please save this email for future reference and, again, thank you for contributing to this important learning opportunity.

The Stanford Business School, in collaboration with the management-consulting 
firm McKinsey & Company, is conducting a large study of global corporations, 
their management practices, and organization.  Enron is participating in the 
project in order to learn how our own practices and activities compare to 
those of other leading global firms and to see which bring true benefits in 
the global marketplace.  One of the unique features of the project is that it 
seeks to assess the knowledge and communication networks within a company by 
asking employees throughout the company to comment on their actual practices 
and experience.  The goal is to obtain real and accurate information by 
surveying the people most directly involved in the company's operations. 

I would like to ask you to help us in getting the most out of our 
participation in the GLOBE Initiative by completing the GLOBE Network 
Survey.  The survey is brief and should take no longer than 15 or 20 
minutes.  Your responses will be treated as strictly confidential, and will 
be used solely by the Stanford/McKinsey researchers to evaluate how specific 
practices and structures impact global communication and knowledge flows.  If 
you would like individual feedback on how your own networks compare to those 
of others in the study, please check the appropriate box at the end of the 
survey.  

Please save this email for future reference and, again, thank you for 
contributing to this important learning opportunity.

Dave:

I really hate to bother you with this, but anything you can do to get these 
guys off the dime and moving (rather than complaining) would be appreciated. 
I called Westfahl as you suggested, but he never responded. At the end of the 
day, I think maybe the board approval we were talking about (Moore, Florida 
and Louisiana) is the only way to send the message. 

One highlight of interest in Coleman's e-mail is that it takes longer than 7 
months to construct a 6 - LM6000 plant. That's pretty amazing given that 
NEPCO just finished constructing four ENA plants (Gleason, Wheatland, Wilton 
and Doyle) in less than 6 months.

Anything you can do (or any advice) would be appreciated. Right now I'm 
simply ignoring the negativism and proceeding as quickly as possible.

Subject: Construction Duration, Florida Peaker Project

Ben,

Reflecting on our conversation at lunch the other day, I want to re-emphasize 
my concerns about the schedule issues.  You indicated that you had an idea 
that the plant could be built in the field in 120 days, or approximately 4 
months.  This is not at all realistic.  I would expect that the most 
aggressive schedule for a greenfield installation of simple cycle gas fired 
LM 6000's would run approximately 90 days for the first unit, plus about two 
weeks for each additional unit.  This would result in an installation 
duration of aproximately 5.5 months for a 6 unit gas fired plant.  In front 
of that there would have to be site preparation and initial foundation work 
done.

The Florida and Louisiana projects can be expected to have significant piling 
requirements which will add probably a minimum of 30 days to the front of 
this schedule, and the dual fuel consideration may lengthen the incremental 
installation time per unit somewhat.  Considering these factors, it would not 
be unreasonable to expect field duration to be 7 months or longer.  

I know that this is much longer than what you have had in mind.  But I think 
that this is real world.  For a 1 June start of operations, this would mean 
getting site access by 1 November, which is only 4 months from now. 

You stated that the permitting requirements may be as much as 6 months for 
Florida.  If this is correct then there is a serious disconnect for your 
schedule.  We need to make all efforts to expedite the on site date if June 
01 commercial operations is to be achieved.

Let's talk.

Mike

George, it is probably worth  speaking to them about the US assets - probably 
the smaller Virginia sites which are probably less core and may be great 
brownfield sites. I'm not sure we would have an interest in UK coal fired 
assets. I would speak to Sherriff on that one. However, I would caution that 
real value is created through RAPID brownfield development leveraging on 
Enron's development, electricity, coal and emissions talents.  

For ComEd and Homer City, Mission has already paid up for these assets based 
on gas being on the margin.  Now that was before a lot of the run up so it 
may be worthwhile; however, I think it may be difficult to arb these guys.  
As well, I think it may be difficult to get the asset out of them - I'm not 
sure that they can turn their strategy or show a loss this quickly from a 
Wall Street point of view.  

We should probably take a shot at the smaller probably less core Virginia 
assets. Are they in QF, if so there may be upside in the deal from Duran's 
point of view..

Dave, given the rise in gas prices and gas being on the margin for a larger 
part of the load curve, coal assets or coal QF's may be great assets for us 
from a restructuring and power asset (expansion/brownfield) point of view.  
Have we looked at this?  Are there many in the market?

Dave - as we know Mission is under pressure with regards to the poor 
performance of their non-regulated generation assets in the US and UK.  It 
appears their  UK coal fired assets (Fiddlers Ferry and Ferrybridge) are for 
sale.  We should consider contacting them to determine their interest to 
divest any part of their US generation asset portfolio as well.

EME owns the former Comed coal and gas fired assets in Chicago, and Homer 
City in Pa.  In addition they have small coal fired generation assets in West 
Virginia and Virginia.  It may be possible to pick up one or more coal fired 
generation assets from Mission, and expand their existing capacity.

We are continuing to work on identifying brown field coal fired sites.  This 
may be another approach to pursue as well.  

Let me know if you think we need to work EME.  Thanks.

efforts

Attached is a spreadsheet summarising the current volunteers from our 
operating companies for this coming season of campus recruiting efforts for 
Analysts and Associates. This information comes from the program and I am 
told is accurate as of last week.



In speaking with many of you over the last few months, I believe it is fair 
to say we have agreed that it is critical for the senior management team to 
show their support for the program and be intimately involved in the 
recruiting process for new Analysts and Associates. In particular, many of 
you have remarked that we are generally short of these resources, as well as 
being short of specific skills which we need either in trading, finance, 
origination or assets to grow our businesses.

In this regard, having reviewed the attached I would suggest that those of 
you that have not currently volunteered to join one of the school recruiting 
teams as well as many of our VP's who have not done so, are encouraged to 
step up immediately. In the spirit of cutting to the chase, here is my 
suggested additional participation, which with your support I will forward to 
Charlene's team and ask them to contact and make themselves available for the 
scheduled school presentation:

Under Grad
 Florida  Colwell
Vanderbilt Ader, Beyer
Penn  Beirbach, Pagan 
Michigan Burnett, Bradley
Baylor  Cocavessis
Morehouse Gomez
Uof H  Detmering
MIT  Hermans
Berkeley McDonald
NYU  Kinneman

Let me know if you think any of these are inappropriate. I will update this 
based on any feedback and contact the individuals directly early next week to 
let them know we would appreciate their help in these efforts.

Angela, if in your view, the issues brought up by Chase are an underlying dissatisfaction with the "entire" agreement, particularily the commodity "savings and advice" component, perhaps it would be advantageous for both Enron and Chase to sit down and re-negotiate.  From our point of view, given the execution and contract issues we currently have with the contract, this may be a win-win for the companies.  Let's sit down and discuss strategy - if you think it would be advantageous, I will replace Tom as senior level contact.

As per my voice mail from this weekend, I would like to get ahead of the potential issues brewing at a number of the other accounts particularily Starwood.

I agree with your perception that Chase feels they are not getting financial and construction value; they also feel there was other  value promised them -- such as , in Manny's words, " strategic commodity management" , i.e.,  insights into, and advice on,  how to respond to changes in the commodity market.

I am requesting that Dag hold off on contacting Manny until Dag and I have met.  I know that we were scheduled to meet  on Tuesday to discuss these very issues but I can move this up to Monday morning.  

 Dag and Cindy have dramatically improved the quality of our billing efforts but the basic contract structure precludes us from ever achieving  customer satisfaction (perfection).    

 I really believe the underlying issue here is that Chase perceives they are not receiving the financial value they had anticipated from the commodity and construction agreements.  We presented a report to them last week that would support their position.  The lack of value created coupled with the  billing issues and a vacancy in senior sponsorship seems to have created the tension that ultimately could put us in a good position to re-negotiate this deal.

 We have identified several areas of contract restructure that will create immediate value for Chase and Enron, eliminate the billing issues and provide them the visibility into the financial performance of the agreement they have been requesting.  

Jeremy has a strong relationship with Mark Shapiro and should be leveraged here.  We need to make sure our response to Mark maximizes the opportunity to get everybody back to the table. 

I am going to the esource conference nex t week with Manny Patino, where he is presenting .  The main reason I am going is  damage control as many of our competitors  will be there and it is my intention to stay close to Manny. (a great heads up from Peggy).

Jeff Skilling called me this afternoon to say that he received a call from Chase Vice Chairman Marc Shapiro. Shapiro said that Chase was upset about:

1. Tom White and Gary Provo no longer being involved with the Chase account

2. Billing errors (unspecified problems)

I explained to Jeff that:

1. Chase wants someone at the Tom White level to continue to be their senior contact; Jeff said that that Dave might want to perform that function

2. We have made major improvements with the billing but we have not reached perfection; perfection is what Chase wants.

Next Steps:

1. We will have to let Chase know who will be their Tom White level contact.

2. Dag Joraholmen will contact Manny Patino at Chase to get specifics on the billing issues and with Evan's team determine what can be done to address such specifics.

As a general rule, we want all information released. Here are some of the 
highlights:

1.  ETC schedules on each transmission line (both DA and HA). We want to see 
the ETC schedules at the same time they are submitted to the ISO on the 
following paths:
 a. path 15
 b. path 26
 c. nw1
 d. nw3
 e. az2
 f. az3
 g. lc1

2. Actual flows on each path. (real time flows)

3. How many mw's get cut on each path DA? i.e. how many mw's are adjustment 
bid out of the stack

4. Intrazonal Cong
 a. What paths have intra-zonal cong
 b. How many mw's flow, how many get cut on a DA/HA basis

5. BEEP stack

6. All load and generation bids DA by SC

7. Real time production from each plant

Body:
The Following memo will be hand delivered to you in hard copy form on Tuesday 
morning, Feb. 20.  We will enclose the pledge form and 
an Enron matching gifts form for your convenience.




Our meeting with Bob May, Dean of the McCombs School of Business at 
UT-Austin, was a great success.  We had 14 attendees who received an update 
from Bob about the many great things going on in Austin, as well as 
opportunities to participate in the &We,re Texas8 capital campaign.

After Bob,s presentation, the 14 Enron officers met separately and were 
extremely supportive about the idea of contributing in a coordinated manner 
to the McCombs School.  This was evidenced by an expression of intent in 
giving totaling about $175,000 from just the 14 people!

Here is what we propose and how it would work.

1. The UT Alumni at Enron would pledge $1 million over four years to the 
McCombs School.  This would consist of $500,000 of gifts from employees and a 
matching $500,000 from Enron.

2. The matching program provided through the McCombs gift to the Business 
School would match the $1 million.

3. The result would be a permanently endowed $2 million &Enron Chair8 to 
support &star quality8 faculty for the school.  This will represent one of 
the largest Faculty Chairs at the Business School.

A few additional details:

1. Each individual,s contribution will also be credited to their name (along 
with the Enron match) for recognition purposes in Business School,s Annual 
Report, President,s Associates, etc.  In other words, a $10,000 contribution 
matched by Enron will be considered as a $20,000 contribution by that 
individual for recognition purposes.

2. Enron has agreed to not count it,s match against an employee,s annual 
matching gift limitation of $15,000, as long as the gift is coordinated in a 
way that makes it a part of the &Enron Chair8.

3. The gift may also be counted toward any previous pledge made to the &We,re 
Texas8 campaign as long as that pledge is not supporting a separately named 
contribution.  Please let us know that this is your intent.

Please carefully consider this request.  I do not plan to finalize the pledge 
until I receive responses from enough officers to support this contribution.  
We have about 40 officers of Enron who are UT alumni and with some 
participation by each of us, we will achieve this level of gift.  Our plans 
are to follow this up with a broader opportunity for all Enron employees that 
are UT alumni; however, the leadership of the group will determine our 
success.

Thanks for your consideration and continuing support of The University of 
Texas.

I just looked over your draft of the fundamental operating standards again.  
I think they are very good and I am just worried about completeness (what are 
we missing).  One thing that occurs to me is logistics and somehow 
reconciling planned physical activity to scheduled activity to actual 
recorded and settled activity.  Is this covered somehow??  Hope all is well.

I wanted to let you know that I really appreciate you taking the time out of 
your very busy shedule to meet with me.  It means a lot to me that you showed 
the level of interest that you did.  I went over the attached documents with 
Jeff and Fred last Wednesday and thought that I should send you a copy to 
update you on where the industrial middle marketing group stands at mid-year. 
I am wrapping up the business plan and strategy that you asked me to 
prepare.  I would still like to meet with you (as well as whomever else you 
decide) at your convenience to review.  I will check with Kay on your 
availability.  

Best Regards,

Subject: Brigham

We have completed the sale of our Brigham investment for $20.0 million 
(JEDI/ENA).  ENA's net share of the proceeds for $12.5 million.   The 
transaction has been closed and funded and at the book/raptor value.

My metaphor for pulling together liquidation transactions of severely 
distressed assets like Brigham is trying to shield a pencil balanced on its 
point in the midst of a hurricane.  In the case of the Brigham deal the 
hurricane was a Force Five.

Jempy Neyman, who led the transaction, and Brandi Morris, a senior specialist 
in Special Assets, did an outstanding job getting this tough deal done.

The next "balanced pencil" is closing the Basic Energy (Sierra Well Service) 
sale by mid-November.  We're on track:  so far, the hurricane has not  blown 
the pencil away.

Janet and Bruce,

On behalf of the Analyst and Associate Program, I want to take this 
opportunity to let you know what a wonderful job Michelle Parks did while 
recruiting at Cornell.  I don't know whether you are aware but we had an 
interviewer not show up.  He also had not called to cancel.  Michelle was in 
the lobby waiting to leave and became aware of the situation.  Although she 
had pressing business in Houston, she made arrangements to stay so that we 
did not have to cancel the schedule.  
Cornell is one of our core schools and it would have been quite embarrassing 
to cancel a full schedule.

We truly appreciate Michelle selflessness and believe she more than exhibits 
Enron's vision and values.  She should be commended.  

Thanks

Charlene Jackson

Subject: meeting w/Enron Wind

I am contacting you to confirm our meeting with you and some of your 
colleagues next Wed. June 14th, 3-4PM.  Attending on Enron Wind's behalf will 
be Kurt Huneke and Adam Umanoff (MD, Commercial Americas)

In the last two months Enron completed the acquisition of the minority shares 
(~20%) in Enron Wind Corp.   As a result of this decision, Enron has also 
made a variety of changes in Enron Wind as a first step to maximizing our 
return in this industry.

One of the very next steps we are taking is an effort to reacquaint the 
various operating subsidiaries with Enron Wind.  As the regulatory 
environment evolves in North America a number of new opportunities are 
evolving which should benefit ENA as a result of Enron's market position.

We thought it might be useful if John Lavorato, Janet Dietrich and Kevin 
Presto were available to join us as well.  Please feel free to invite anyone 
else you feel would be appropriate.  As you may know, we have begun to 
discuss some of these opportunities with EPMI and we are encouraged by the 
way we see the market developing.

Please let me know if you have any questions regarding this meeting.

Thank you,
Michael Payne

To: Rob Milnthorp/CAL/ECT@ECT
cc:  
Subject: Reporting Structure

Rob, independent of dotted/solid lines, you already have the primary and 
complete responsibility to manage the office and the business.  At the risk 
of being bold,  I think the undercurrent of your note and your discussions 
with Haedicke over the last couple of days is a matter of absolute control.  
Ownership and passion are important characteristics of our best commercial 
people but so is fostering a diversity of opinions and ideas.  With the back 
and mid office,  the current Enron model is based upon scale and 
standardization which generates tremendous operating leverage.  Further, it 
helps us manage risk and is a board mandated control issue.   In the 
long-run, it is actually less costly (ie) systems that don't work together, 
less transferable human capital, un-managed legal risks, etc. 

A lot of your points are very valid and Haedicke has never and never will get 
in the way of managing commercial business; however, Mark, Wes, Sally, Beth 
et al have a mandate to provide a flexible, scalable but standardized 
delivery mechanism, that manages our risk across the broad empire.  Don't 
quit protecting the business and your people; however, please help accomplish 
some of these goals as well.

In short, I would like to keep the reporting structures the same.  

Lets take the earliest opporunity to discuss this.

Regards
Delainey

To: David W Delainey/HOU/ECT@ECT

Subject: Reporting Structure

Dave, at the risk of rocking the boat, I would like you to consider the 
following. As you know, with the exception of Origination & Finance, all 
other Canadian departments (Trading, Legal, Ops, Acctg, HR, Govt, & IT) 
report directly to someone in Houston while having a dotted line to me. 

In my mind, this is completely backwards (ie. it should be a solid line to 
me, and a dotted line to their respective counterparts in Houston) for the 
following reasons. First, performance feedback is not communicated to these 
individuals in a timely manner if at all. Even when it is, more times than 
not, it is perfunctory in nature. In fact, I think that feedback is given 
somewhat reluctantly because the manager  in Houston has really no idea 
whether the individual in Canada is doing a good job or not. 

Second, it is sub-optimal. I seem to be spending more and more time dealing 
with issues between the Canadian employee and their respective manager in 
Houston. Many of these conversations revolve around my first point. Case and 
point, we almost lost Laura Scott earlier this year because she was feeling 
unappreciated and felt that her boss had no idea the hours/effort she was 
putting in. And just yesterday, I had a very unsatisfactory phone call with 
Mark Haedicke regarding Peter Keohane. The result - I now have a very 
demotivated lawyer on my hands.

Third, it is costly. Having senior people fly up to Calgary/Toronto to "stay 
in the loop" and to complete performance reviews is both costly from both a 
dollar and time perspective.  

Frankly, I'm not looking for more performance reviews to do, but I do think 
its important that staff receive meaningful feedback in a timely fashion. I 
know what these people do - I work with them every day. It is my job to lead, 
inspire, and motivate but lately it feels like it is my job to liase between 
Houston and the employee.

I would appreciate your thoughts on this.

Regards
Milnthorp

Jim, my understanding is that there continues to be some discussion on 
whether there will be functional seperation of the retail and wholesale 
businesses and to what extent and under what strategy these are undertaken.  
I am not sure that we want to put ourselves in a box under any structure 
until these things are completely ironed out eg) country managers et al.  I'm 
not in agreement with any memo that further details the organization beyond 
what was outlined in the original memo.  However, I am in agreement that this 
needs to get resolved ASAP unfortunately Frevert and Skilling and most of the

tonight to give people partial information on work in progress.  Silence is

Chris, the numbers are getting pretty large - we are trying to find a

visable budgets.  In the West, that includes Tim/Mike for trading; Chris/Greg 
for mid market and yourself for origination.

I hope this rationale will manage your issues.  If we invite Jake I think you 
do have to invite Parquet and McDonald and we just don't have the room.

Lets discuss.

Dave,

I spoke with Frank Gardner, the acting President of the mine.  The mine has 
shut down due to high power prices and they are evaluating reopening it later 
this year.  John Malowney in our mid-market group has covered these guys very 
well (Frank acknowledged that).  EPMI has served this load in the past and 
made numerous proposals to them during the past year.  Montana rejected 
these, including the attached proposal that offered to fix prices well below 
the current forward market price.  John has also proposed various 
cross-commodity (copper) deals with our MG affiliate.  John will discuss 
their situation with Frank and I will follow up from time to time.  I do not 
think there is an attractive generation opportunity as Montana is net long 
and the industrials' credit is marginal.  We will keep you posted if anything 
materializes. 

Regards,

Chris

Chris, I called MRI but Frank was too busy to take the call so I left my name 
and number and said if nothing else I'd see him on the 5th of October.  Just 
so you'll know, attached is a sample Term Sheet that I have previously showed

I really hate to bother you with this, but anything you can do to get these 
guys off the dime and moving (rather than complaining) would be appreciated. 
I called Westfahl as you suggested, but he never responded. At the end of the 
day, I think maybe the board approval we were talking about (Moore, Florida 
and Louisiana) is the only way to send the message. 

One highlight of interest in Coleman's e-mail is that it takes longer than 7 
months to construct a 6 - LM6000 plant. That's pretty amazing given that 
NEPCO just finished constructing four ENA plants (Gleason, Wheatland, Wilton 
and Doyle) in less than 6 months.

Anything you can do (or any advice) would be appreciated. Right now I'm 
simply ignoring the negativism and proceeding as quickly as possible.

Subject: Construction Duration, Florida Peaker Project

Ben,

Reflecting on our conversation at lunch the other day, I want to re-emphasize 
my concerns about the schedule issues.  You indicated that you had an idea 
that the plant could be built in the field in 120 days, or approximately 4 
months.  This is not at all realistic.  I would expect that the most 
aggressive schedule for a greenfield installation of simple cycle gas fired 
LM 6000's would run approximately 90 days for the first unit, plus about two 
weeks for each additional unit.  This would result in an installation 
duration of aproximately 5.5 months for a 6 unit gas fired plant.  In front 
of that there would have to be site preparation and initial foundation work 
done.

The Florida and Louisiana projects can be expected to have significant piling 
requirements which will add probably a minimum of 30 days to the front of 
this schedule, and the dual fuel consideration may lengthen the incremental 
installation time per unit somewhat.  Considering these factors, it would not 
be unreasonable to expect field duration to be 7 months or longer.  

I know that this is much longer than what you have had in mind.  But I think 
that this is real world.  For a 1 June start of operations, this would mean 
getting site access by 1 November, which is only 4 months from now. 

You stated that the permitting requirements may be as much as 6 months for 
Florida.  If this is correct then there is a serious disconnect for your 
schedule.  We need to make all efforts to expedite the on site date if June 
01 commercial operations is to be achieved.

Let's talk.

Mike

Joe, where is the arb? Ultimately, this cannot be a cost of capital play 
given the owners.  Is this primarily an off-balance sheet issue for the 
customer?  Are we taking disposal or terminal value risk on the facility?  
Operational risk? Did we come up with this structure or was this the mandated 
structure in the RFP?

Is this a play that you would support? 

On a previous issue, do you feel confident that we can monetize the El Paso 
note on the ECP sale at the 8.25%?  It is important for us to be able to 
quickly monetize this note for obvious reasons.

How is it going otherwise?

Subject: Re: Devil's Tower  

David,

Devils Tower is a deepwater project on Mississippi Canyon block 773.  
Dominion is the operator and has a 60% working interest in the project.  
Mariner Energy (20%) and Pioneer Resources (20%) are the remaining working 
interest owners.

During the first week of September, Production Offshore, managed by Tom 
Byargeon, received an RFP and an information packet to submit a proposal for 
the development of a floating production system and export pipelines.

Since the Devils Towers project exists in a prolific active deepwater reserve 
area and this area has little developed infrastructure, this project is 
strategic and creates a very relevant and marketable infrastructure 
position.  For example, Exxon has indicated their interest in tying back 
their production from Crazy Horse (south of Devils Tower) to this platform.  
In addition, the production from this platform could be funneled into Exxon's 
export pipelines on the shelf.

This project will financed by a structure where Enron forms a joint venture 
(JV) with an independent third party.   The joint venture partners capitalize 
the JV with a nominal amount of funds.  The JV leases capacity on the 
platform and export pipelines from a special purpose vehicle (SPV).  The SPV 
uses the lease agreement to obtain a loan from financial institutions.  In 
turn, the SPV uses equity capital (from a tax based investor) and the loan 
proceeds to purchase or develop the deepwater assets.

The JV receives cash flows from leasing the production capacity from the 
Devils Tower deepwater assets.  This capacity on the deepwater assets will be 
sold for five to seven years under a production handling agreement (PHA).  
Final point, the JV receives a financial instrument (most likely a note 
receivable)  equal to their portion of the net proceeds from the PHA.

Enron books income on the monetization of this financial instrument via a 
FASB sell down (most likely, selling a note receivable to a bank for cash).  
In addition, because the lease capacity for the deepwater assets will be sold 
for only five-seven years and these assets will have a minimum working life 
for twenty, there exists potential upside for Enron.  For example, cash flows 
from incremental PHAs (ie., through tiebacks to Devils Tower deepwater 
assets) can be monetized via the FASB 125 sell down.

The financial structure was designed to minimize capital outlays and 
financial risk.  Also, Joe Deffner and Roger Ondreko are very familar with 
the structure and assisted in its design.

The RFP is due October 2nd.   There will a meeting tommorrow from 1-3 pm to 
discuss the status of the proposal in EB 3583. Please feel free to attend.

Regards, 

Jean

Dave

In response to your e mail, this is meant to update you on the status of the 
search for potential coal fired generation sites.

We have used the following criteria to screen potential sites east of the 
Mississippi including the following:

 Underutilized existing coal fired generation (15 sites)
 Existing coal fired generation that is on cold stand by (12 sites)
 Coal units that have been retired (20 sites)
 Coal fired units that at one time had planned coal unit additions that were 
delayed or cancelled (11 sites)
 Undeveloped sites that had planned to build coal units (13 sites)
 Undeveloped sites that had planned to build nuclear units (5 sites)

We are in the process of prioritizing each site based on infrastructure, 
transmission access, market and permit status. That effort should be 
concluded this week and the study forwarded to you. We are also talking with 
two coal operators that are in the process of developing their own coal fired 
generation in Kentucky and West Virginia.

We will keep you apprised of the progress and meet with you again as we move 
to the next stage.

From Mike Miller and Mitch Robinson

John -

After today's conference call regarding the peakers and after today's failed 
attempt to commercially dispatch two of the units at the Lincoln facility, we 
see the following action items that need immediate resolution in order to get 
the peakers back on schedule:

Lincoln:
1.  Discussion with GE at sufficiently high level to determine whether any GE 
units at any sites have ever made <9 ppm NOx with CO <25 ppm (M. Dobler has 
initiated this discussion with Michelle April of GE).
2.  A detailed plan of attack from GE to get the units within guarantee 
emission limits.
3.  Resolution of the HMI sluggish response issue complete with a plan of 
attack.  The units can be run, but are clearly not ready for commercial 
operation with the sluggish HMI.

Wheatland:
1.  A plan of attack from Westinghouse to correct the fuel valves (and/or 
nozzles) on units 1 and 2.  Currently, the units can not be run reliably at 
base load.
2.  Plan of attack and schedule to correct the vibrations on 1 & 2.
3.  A response from Westinghouse and PCD to get dedicated TD and controls 
support (this comment also applies to Gleason); sharing Rutledge and PCD 
controls personnel is proving inadequate.
4.  Frequent technical questions for Westinghouse are taking extended time to 
get answers.  A dedicated EE&CC or NEPCO representative in the Orlando office 
would help facilitate getting rapid answers (applies to Gleason also).

Gleason:
1.  A detailed schedule and plan of attack is needed for the compressor blade 
modifications on units 1&2.
2.  An on-site EE&CC representative is required to bird-dog the compressor 
blade seals modification.
3.  Verification from Westinghouse that the 12 day modification will not slip 
into 3 weeks is required (see item 1).
4.  Verification that the IGV's have been fully corrected is required.
5.  A response from Westinghouse and PCD to get dedicated TD and controls 
support (this comment also applies to Wheatland); sharing Rutledge and PCD 
controls personnel is proving inadequate.
6.  Frequent technical questions for Westinghouse are taking extended time to 
get answers.  A dedicated EE&CC or NEPCO representative in the Orlando office 
would help facilitate getting rapid answers (applies to Wheatland also).

Rob, independent of dotted/solid lines, you already have the primary and 
complete responsibility to manage the office and the business.  At the risk 
of being bold,  I think the undercurrent of your note and your discussions 
with Haedicke over the last couple of days is a matter of absolute control.  
Ownership and passion are important characteristics of our best commercial 
people but so is fostering a diversity of opinions and ideas.  With the back 
and mid office,  the current Enron model is based upon scale and 
standardization which generates tremendous operating leverage.  Further, it 
helps us manage risk and is a board mandated control issue.   In the 
long-run, it is actually less costly (ie) systems that don't work together, 
less transferable human capital, un-managed legal risks, etc. 

A lot of your points are very valid and Haedicke has never and never will get 
in the way of managing commercial business; however, Mark, Wes, Sally, Beth 
et al have a mandate to provide a flexible, scalable but standardized 
delivery mechanism, that manages our risk across the broad empire.  Don't 
quit protecting the business and your people; however, please help accomplish 
some of these goals as well.

In short, I would like to keep the reporting structures the same.

Dave, at the risk of rocking the boat, I would like you to consider the 
following. As you know, with the exception of Origination & Finance, all 
other Canadian departments (Trading, Legal, Ops, Acctg, HR, Govt, & IT) 
report directly to someone in Houston while having a dotted line to me. 

In my mind, this is completely backwards (ie. it should be a solid line to 
me, and a dotted line to their respective counterparts in Houston) for the 
following reasons. First, performance feedback is not communicated to these 
individuals in a timely manner if at all. Even when it is, more times than 
not, it is perfunctory in nature. In fact, I think that feedback is given 
somewhat reluctantly because the manager  in Houston has really no idea 
whether the individual in Canada is doing a good job or not. 

Second, it is sub-optimal. I seem to be spending more and more time dealing 
with issues between the Canadian employee and their respective manager in 
Houston. Many of these conversations revolve around my first point. Case and 
point, we almost lost Laura Scott earlier this year because she was feeling 
unappreciated and felt that her boss had no idea the hours/effort she was 
putting in. And just yesterday, I had a very unsatisfactory phone call with 
Mark Haedicke regarding Peter Keohane. The result - I now have a very 
demotivated lawyer on my hands.

Third, it is costly. Having senior people fly up to Calgary/Toronto to "stay 
in the loop" and to complete performance reviews is both costly from both a 
dollar and time perspective.  

Frankly, I'm not looking for more performance reviews to do, but I do think 
its important that staff receive meaningful feedback in a timely fashion. I 
know what these people do - I work with them every day. It is my job to lead, 
inspire, and motivate but lately it feels like it is my job to liase between 
Houston and the employee.

I would appreciate your thoughts on this.

Regards
Milnthorp

Guys, we are bringing through a VP candidate for your review.

Her name is Faye Worthy.  She has a great sales history in the energy 
industry and I think can really help us in the franchise market (ie) 
McDonalds, Safeway, Starbucks, Motel 6, etc.

I would really appreciate you spending a little time with her.   I will 
forward her resume.

Thanks
Dave

Subject: TVA Status


Hey Dave. We are focused on selling our interests in the Calvert City, Ky. 
site now that we've successfully transferred the AES sale from Calvert City 
to Haywood. We have two counterparties that have shown a high degree of 
interest in Calvert City: Duke and Cleco. There are no issues surrounding 
Cleco but there may be with Duke from the following standpoint: our Calvert 
City site is ahead of Duke's Calvert City site in the interconnect que. 
Apparently, TVA erroneously did not factor in our interconnect application 
into their facilities study for Duke, and gave Duke an indication that there 
should not be material transmission upgrade costs for their plant 
interconnect. As both TVA and Duke now realize, our interconnect status does 
present a problem for Duke (and therefore TVA). We plan to talk with Duke in 
parallel with Cleco and I anticipate Duke then confronting TVA with the 
situation. 

I want to ensure our discussions with TVA and Duke over the next few weeks 
don't jeopardize our settlement with TVA. Will this settlement be closed by 
mid-January (thought that's what I heard)? Let me know your thoughts. Thanks.

Thanks for your time and patience today.

For now, I'll park the theoretical and focus on the practical.  (we can pick 
up the other topics later over beers sometime)

I completely agree that the US coal-genco business can offer a huge near-term 
win for those that move swiftly.

Thanks for offering me the shot to capitalize on it.

Dear friends:

The departure of Jeff, like losing a member of your family, is never a pleasant experience.  He has created immense wealth for the Enron shareholder over his eleven or so years at Enron.  We will all miss him. 

However, this is in our rear view mirror and we need to move forward to reach our goals.  I want to share a number of key points that should be well communicated and understood:
	a) Ken is re-assuming the CEO role one that he has held for nearly fifteen years except for the last six months.  He understands this company.  He built Enron.  He is prepared to lead this company into the future for as long as it takes to reach our goals;
	b) The investment community knows Ken and likes his approach.  This is probably an upside given Jeff's struggles with this group;
	c) The key leaders in the organization across all of Enron, including Greg Whalley, John Lavorato, Mark Frevert, Jim Fallon, Stan Horton amongst many others, are clearly committed to Enron and its goals.  We are all firmly aligned behind Ken;
	d) There is no change to Enron's strategies and business principles going forward;
	e) The committment to the retail business is un-wavering.  Support for EES, within Enron, is at its highest in years;
	f) There is a very deep talent base in Enron and all key origination, trading and finance people are under contract; and
	g) My committment to our employees, Enron and the retail energy business continues without question.

There will be a lot of distractions for the next few days; it is very important that we move on and stay focused.  The retail and wholesale energy business must reach its short and long term goals.  I am confident we will be successful.

I am hoping to set up a number of floor meetings today to further discuss and answer any questions.  

Regards
Dave

David, I wouldn't do the Brown Bag (too often- too hard to keep doing); I 
wouldn't do the Social Gathering (too country clubish); I like the Monthly 
Dinner/Cocktail Hour/Ballgame, etc with the OTC and parts of the management  
team as a forum to identify talent, give A&A's exposure to the management 
team and to "sell" ENA. I would suggest that we make it every two months 
rather than monthly. However, I would have the first one very quickly for the 
top rated A&A in ENA that are due to rotate soon in order to try and pitch 
them on staying in ENA - maybe dinner and ballgame. 

For the resource management and coaching part of the program, lets wait until 
we see where we end up on any possible changes to the program first.  I 
assume that you are working on a couple strawmen on possible alternatives. 
Once we have a few ideas, I would like to pitch Whalley, Sherriff and Mark 
when I get back.

Lets go ahead and implement above ASAP.

This looks like we are going to be in a long pissing match with Edison.  It would be very helpful to know what our position is with DA customers before Cal Push 1 and Cal Push 2 going forward.  I know that this is probably a pain, but it seems like that's information that we need to know.  Also, it appears that Edison is under the opinion that we were short a call option to them during the ctc recovery period.  Edison gets to keep positive ctc's while they get to recover negative ctc's from esp's.

jeff d., what does edison say to the point that they got to keep positive ctc's and are now attempting to amortize negative ctc's?

Subject:	Update:  Meeting w/Edison RE: recovery of Negative CTC Claim

?	We met with Edison yesterday in the attempt to settle our negative CTC claim.
?	Edison continues to take a very hard-line, extreme position.  This is it in a nutshell:
1.	all customers--bundled and DA alike--"contributed to Edison's undercollection" and all customers must pay it down; 
2.	bundled customers contributed through frozen rates and DA customers contributed through the negative CTC;
3.	Edison says it will pay ESPs past due amounts related to the negative CTC, but it intends to then turn around and assess a charge on all customer bills--DA and bundled alike--to recover its undercollection. 
4.	Edison intends to collect it over approximately 2 years.  Edison estimates that the charge to DA customers over this period would be about $25-27/MWH.
5.	Under Edison's plan, Enron would likely end up paying Edison, i.e., the present value of the "undercollection" charge would exceed the present value of the lump sum negative CTC payment.
?	Obviously, with respect to any settlement with Edison, we're extremely far apart and we're therefore considering other 	options.
?	In the meantime, the California PUC is engaged in DA and PX credit-related activities beginning next week and Edison 	will try to get the Commission to adopt their proposal.
?	We are working with other market participants and gearing up to vigorously oppose Edison's proposal at the PUC.
?	We will distribute something on Monday describing our approach and tactics at the PUC for folks to review and 	comment on.
?	We are scheduled to meet with Edison again next Thursday to try to knock some sense into them (the probability of 	which is low).

If you have any questions, let us know.

Best,
Jeff

Kevin, I am not sure that you will get credit from the buyer for the 
increased MW's given well known industry issues with the 501F technology.  
Further, any buyer will pay based upon 90 degree output which is the same in 
any case (ie) increased output only helps when ambient temperatures are lower 
than 90 degrees at site.  Likely the buyer will run any spread option value 
or multiple value based on 90 degree output.

I may be wrong but it is also my recollection that this is a warranty issue 
rather than a true output issue (ie) we could increase the MW's at any time 
but we would likely run into warranty issues with Westinghouse.  Given that 
the warranty expires in less than twelve months, what value do we really 
get.  Would it not be better to get the maximum amount of hard dollars out of 
Westinghouse rather than an increase in output which will only be guaranteed 
for a limited amount of time and likely will not be paid for by a buyer.

The thought process on the EECC side is for them to find overhead and cost 
savings to fund their fee ($9.0M) rather than further increase to the capital 
cost of the facilities.  As well, given current accounting language, any fee 
we pay will have to be expensed to current earnings rather than capitalized 
so I would like to find ways for this to be self financing.

My knowledge on this one is rather cursory - can you guys work this out and 
adjust tactics with EECC as necessary.

Subject: Westinghouse LD's for Gleason/Wheatland

Given the probable sale of these 2 facilities, I would like clarification on 
the LD proceeds from Westinghouse.  See questions/points below.

1)  Izzo has claimed that you (Delainey) has agreed to pay EE&CC for 
construction services in the form of Westinghouse LD payments.  Is this 
correct?
2)  I am concerned that EE&CC will settle for cash payment from Westihnghouse 
(Heat Rate & Schedule penalties) rather than increased output.
3)  Given a sale at $450/kW, increased output is worth $5 million vs. the 
$1-2 million we would collect for schedule and Heat Rate LD's.
4)  My recommendation is to trade the HR and schedule shortfall for increased 
output at Gleason to maximize total Enron profitability.

From ENA's perspective we should collect the schedule penalty at Wheatland 
only and insist on the 12 MW additional output at Gleason.  This combination 
provides the best value to Enron.

If Izzo's form of payment for the construction jobs is Westinghouse LD's, 
then he will be motivated to recieve cash payment.  Please provide me the 
necessary feedback to ensure that we do the right thing for Enron.

Thanks Dave.

Dear Mr Delainey:

We met in the Associate Orientation last summer when you asked me if I would 
like to join ENA for my first rotation. But since our first rotation was
assigned instead of chosen by ourselves, I was in no position to accept your 
kindly invitation. Now that I am two months away from finishing my
first rotation, I remembered our conversation during the Orientation and was 
more than eager to send you this  email hoping that your invitation is
still open.

I would love to join ENA (EA).  I believe by doing so, I will be given the 
opportunity to work with the smartest people in this industry.
I also believe I am prepared to join the trading unit in ENA.  I have five 
years' experience in Metals trading - both physical and financial. At
business school at UT Austin, I chose Energy Finance as my concentration and 
enjoyed tremendously these courses:

Risk management: Swap, Options, Delta and Vega hedge,...
Financial Strategy for Energy Companies: Financial decisions on investment 
and long-term hedge, ...
Financial Engineering: Case studies on financial products invented by 
Investment banks
Real Option Valuation: Decision making process considering the optionality in 
the future
Energy Law: Regulation and Environment issues in Energy Industry.

All this above and my passion for this industry and Enron  give me confidence 
to explore the opportunity to work in ENA. Only if you could
give me five minutes of your precious time to allow me to prove my 
qualifications, I will greatly appreciate it.

Have another  great year!

Dave,

Coyote:  BPAmoco flaked so Avista is trying to move forward to take the whole 
deal (some public embarrassment if they dont close since they announced it 
last week).  At the same time, DLJ is bringing in some of the industry 
players that originally expressed interest.  One of those parties that called 
Jake is Orion, so Jake let Don Miller know this.  We will have a handle on 
preliminary feedback from these parties on Friday.  

Pastoria and LVCogen:  Deal books should have arrived.  Do you want to meet 
on these?  who would you like to meet with?  Parquet for Pastoria and 
Gilbert/Clark for LVCogen?  

Pastoria DASH is being finalized along with the Catalytica DASH.  Pastoria 
costs will be higher given the unwind of the Xonon swap and the fact that 
turbine costs were padded by $9MM for GE's catalytica development costs 
(argument for a value-grab!)

FYI I called Patrick Stevens of Triumph Energy three times...the number I 
called appeared to be an office shared with other companies.  The general 
number's voicemail was full so I have not reached him.

Scott Healy changed his decision and is going to work for Duran.  I dont 
understand his decision but Scott said that the "organization" thought it 
would be a better opportunity in Houston.

The purpose of this message is to update employees on the
status of the California Attorney General's order regarding the preservation
of business information.  Please NOTE THE IMPORTANT POLICIES DESCRIBED
BELOW.

We have negotiated procedures with the
California Attorney General's office allowing each of you to manage your
email and hard drive capacity while still preserving business information.


Starting today, please implement the
following business information retention policies:

(1) PERSONAL EMAIL: can be kept, discarded,
etc. at will.

(2) BUSINESS EMAIL: do not delete any
business email sent or received for 24 hours.  This 24 hour delay will allow
the network to save a backup copy of the email.  After 24 hours, BUSINESS
EMAIL may be kept, discarded, etc. at will.

(3) WORD PROCESSING FILES OR FILE FRAGMENTS:
do not delete any SAVED FILE or any FILE FRAGMENT.  This policy covers any
FILE or FILE FRAGMENT that you have saved on your hard disk or the network.

(4) DATABASES: do not delete any information
in DATABASES.

(5) EXCEL SPREADSHEETS: do not delete any
information in EXCEL SPREADSHEETS.

(6) CALENDARS OR SCHEDULING PROGRAMS: do not
delete any information.

(7) OTHER ELECTRONIC DATA: do not delete any
OTHER ELECTRONIC DATA.

(8) HARD DRIVE CAPACITY: in the event that
you run out of disk space on your personal computer, you may copy files to
the network (where they will be backed up), then delete the files from your
personal computer to create the work space you need.  DO NOT DELETE ANY FILE
BEFORE YOU HAVE COPIED IT TO THE NETWORK.


In our negotiations we have discovered no
reason to believe that Enron has been singled out for investigation by the
Attorney General.  We will update you as we learn more.

Please respond promptly to this notice via
email an e-mail to me.  Your email should state that you understand and 
intend to comply
with the important business information retention policies stated above.

Thanks for your help in this matter.

Here is a trade for you.  According to the Master Agreement, all technology equipment on Schedule 27 was being conveyed to UBS.  All FF&E on Schedule 18 was not.  It turns out that the Estate in Portland needs some of the technology equipment on Schedule 27.  This includes servers, computers, printers, etc.  We need some of the stuff on Schedule 18 such as the desks and chairs.  We are guaranteed use of this stuff so long as we stay in this building.  Therefore, we could use it forever for free if we chose to stay here.  It seems that we have a fair trade here.  If you don't convey this equipment to us the only effect is that you will likely prevent us from moving as it will be too expensive!!!  An option to buy the equipment from the estate is essentially a worthless option.  The furiture will have little value to the estate and may be a liability as demand for that stuff in Portland is low and the cost to move is high (e.g., in Mexico shutting down the office cost $40k plus storage fees to move furniture into storage).  Furthermore, I have no reason to believe that an accounting firm working for the estate will give us a "fair" value on the furniture.  We don't want any furniture from the 4th floor that the estate will need.  Bottom line, we can give the estate computers and servers and they can keep the fourth floor furniture and everything will work well for them.  We give up some computers and servers to the estate but keep the furniture on the 3rd floor.  Everyone is happy and it makes economic sense.

Let's just do this trade that makes sense for everybody.

I have asked Jeff Golden and Don Miller.  Don is leaning towards giving UBS a purchase option at fair market value.  Though I haven't heard from Jeff, he could decide to "give" UBS the FF&E now, but he'd probably need to trade it for something else he wants.

It was just brought to my attention by Dave Steiner that the Estate will continue to own the F(urniture), F(ixtures), and E(quipment) and that UBS will be able to use it for free so long as we are in this building.

As you both know, it is possible that we will move from this floor and would like to take a good portion of the FFE with us.  My understanding is that Enron is leasing the furniture in Houston and owns the furniture in Portland.  Therefore, it makes sense for the Houston office to continue to use the furniture but not move it.  It doesn't make as much sense here as it will be expensive for the Estate to dispose of the furniture here and it will be even more expensive to move it to sell it.

Here's the issue -- the Estate should convey the furniture in Portland to UBS.  Is this possible?  What do we need to do to make this happen?

They couldn't give me a succinct, definitive status on my previous wish list, so I told them to finish or terminate all of the old stuff before we talk about new stuff.  

Since I never receive a price signal from these guys I have no idea what they are spending money on and who it is supposed to benefit.  I am currently receiving promises with no effective project management and little or nothing of value to show from their efforts on projects I have requested.

Everyone,

We have just received an order from the California Attorney General requiring 
all employees (except legal, admin, and human resources staff) to take the 
following steps immediately:

   1.  Save all e-mails, i.e., don't delete any e-mails.
   2.  Do not delete any information in databases.
   3.  Do not delete any word processing files or file fragments.
   4.  Do not delete any excel spreadsheets or calendars or scheduling 
programs. 
   5.  Any other electronic data not otherwise covered.

This request is being made in connection with the California AG's 
investigation into electricity prices.  We do not know how many other 
companies have received a similar order, but there is no reason for us to 
assume at this time that Enron has been singled out.  

Over the next few days we will be working with our technology group to figure 
out the most efficient way to manage this request.  This is a serious matter 
and we strongly urge every person affected by this request to cooperate fully 
with this order.  We appreciate your help with this and will keep you 
apprised of any changes in policy.

Subject: Miscellaneous

Hey guys, just a few housekeeping notes:

1.)  Employee Expenses:  We really need to try and trim the expenses where 
and whenever possible. Get your Assistants to make all reservations for 
air/hotel/car so that they can ensure the best rates for your needs. ENA (and 
our groups) spends an incredible amount of money on travel expenses and we 
really need to attempt to trim this back where we can. Efficiencies in 
booking can probably help a lot. That means use Vitol or TAP or whoever else 
if they're cheaper and give you good service. Letting your Assistants handle 
your travel arrangements will not only ensure the best rates, it should allow 
you to spend more time on more productive endeavors! 

2.)  Customer trips/expenses: Any customer expense greater than $2000 must be 
approved by the ENA Office of the Chairman in advance of the expenditure.  
Your Assistants have the forms and once you've filled them out, I need to 
approve/sign them before going upstairs for approval.

3.)  All employee reviews should be completed by now for 
Directors/Managers/Associates/Analysts/ Assistants. All reviews should be 
written, signed by both the supervisor and employee, and given to Fran Mayes 
for filing.  Fran- If you have not received all written reviews by this 
Friday, please advise. This should include the 5 East Midstream groups and 
both the Gas and Power Structuring groups. We have just completed the VP PRC 
as of yesterday and I will be sitting down with each of the VP's for feedback 
over the next week.

4.) We are entering the homestretch for most of our deals this year and it is 
extremely important that we stay completely focused on doing everything 
possible to bring these deals to closure. Top priorities as I see them are as 
follows:

Ozzie Pagan:  TexMex, Alamac/Cogentrix, Green Jacket, Brazos/Tenaska
Jeff Ader:          NSTAR, CRRA,  Silver Oak, ConEd, NYSEG
Bruce Sukaly:  AES-NY, Assets (Cinergy/Wilton Plant/ Pontiac/Plano, 
EPNG/Wheatland, etc), AEC
Gil Muhl:            PSEG, NJN
Laura Luce:      Manlove Storage Monetization, HUB deals
Ben Jacoby:   Florida Merchant Plant, Continue building optionality on Site 
Bank, Coal Plant development
Ed and Bernie: Continue to drive the commodity deals to closure

We're definitely set up to execute on our 2000 business plan and strategy. 
The above deals are our #1 priority for the rest of the year. Let's stay very 
well coordinated on these deals and do everything we can to drive them to 
closure. Elevate any internal hurdles earlier rather than later and  I'll 
personally handle them.
There are many other deals I'd like to also see closed ( Tangerine and Ft. 
Pierce - George McCormick, Vepco/NC - Heather Kroll, ANP-Mark Bernstein, 
VNG/AGL- Ed McMichael, TXU- Jim Ducote, Energen/Haywood - Healy/Jacoby) and 
many others I'd like to continue to see get teed up for next year.  

5.)  Please forward any information above to your groups if appropriate.

Thanks!

Subject: Enron Direct Canada-First Deal

Harold;

We have today closed our first retail transaction that is a five year 
exclusive gas supply arrangement with Boardwalk Equities, the largest 
apartment building owner in Alberta.  We will be serving 20,000 apartment 
suites with an annual consumption of 1.5 bcf.  The 5 year margin will be 
approximately $1.5 million.  As a result of our direct instructions, 
Boardwalk lobbied the government to provide them with $2.8 million dollars in 
rebates over the next 4 months to shield them from the higher gas prices.  
These rebates will be paid through Enron Direct as the retailer for Boardwalk.

The gas begins flow on March 1.  We are working on other large building 
owners and restaurant chains and expect to close 2 or 3 more deals for flow 
of March 1. Cadillac Fairview is committed to working with us on a gas 
contract within the next 2 weeks.   We now have a strong platform to grow 
quickly, from a standing start one month ago.

Although the government effectively delayed the opening of the retail power 
market for one year through a price cap, we have been able to grasp a first 
mover advantage on retailing natural gas in Alberta.  We expect to have a 
strong retail delivery organization built by mid year, with 35 staff managing 
a significant number of commercial customers.

The current pricing environment creates a large opportunity to sell 5 year 
fixed price product with significant margins.  Atco, the gas utility is 
getting bad press for not offering hedging instruments, and are cooperating 
with us to assist us in getting established as a retailer.  

This has been a very large effort in the last month, as we needed to get 
licensed, and get legal agreements in place where there were no precedents to 
look at.  We are excited at the prospects for a substantial business 
developing very quickly here in Alberta.  The Enron Canada analytical, risk 
management, regulatory and legal staff have provided great assistance to 
allow us to execute this transaction in a short period.

Regards.

Dave

Hi Beth,
I hate to be uncooperative, particularly after all that we have accomplished together, but I can't see where in the Enron/UBS agreement it says that Enron needs or gets to keep the West Power Fundamentals system.  Furthermore, I have no assurances that Enron is in a position to keep this information confidential as Richard Schweiger is rightfully looking for a new job.  Richard could easily understand what we are doing and use it to secure a job with AEP, Pacificorp or someone else here in town.  I don't mean to question Richard's integrity, but these are very strange times.

Until I receive word from UBS or Greg Whalley I am sitting tight.

Again, sorry to be uncooperative, but it doesn't appear to me that our interests are aligned right now and I need to protect our competitive advantage.

Regards,
Tim

All,

I have been requested to obtain a working copy of all fundamental systems.  The estate wants to preserve them and they should be available for use within the estate.

I will dedicate systems resources to working with your groups.  Your cooperation is greatly appreciated.

I will have Richard Burchfield coordinate these efforts.  Richard Schweiger will assist us in Portland.

The following is a status update of key current items:
1. We continue to try to confirm the viability of the Peoples units.  We have 
not received NOx versus water injection data.  We still have not received the 
full noise spectrum data.  It looks like the only source for this is ABB and 
they're not fast.  Peoples and ourselves are going after ABB on these issues 
(and the possibility of a change order on the exciter design which doesn't 
meet Ontario specs).
 - we have confirmed that the municipality can provide 600 USGPM of water, 
but the silica content has to be confirmed to see if it's a problem.  I met 
with Terra Industrial Tuesday and they remain interested in providing the 
treated water, but they would have to expand their treatment plant.  They can 
provide 1/3rd of the water required and their permit can handle the waste 
stream on regen for the full water flow - we're sorting out the optimum tank 
capacity versus treatment plant capacity sizing to meet reliability at 
minimum cost.  Bottom line is we've got options to handle this water flow and 
we can avoid trying to get a permit for waste water.
 - we're going to use the noise consultant EE&CC used in conjunction with 
Agra Envir. in Canada to sort out the low frequency noise problem, and check 
the other frequencies against our nearest receptor, once we get the data from 
ABB.
 - Peoples are checking with ABB on the possibility of a change order on the 
exciter design.
2. MCN/Columbus have come back on the other two N2 units - they want another 
$1 MM US and can't confirm any changes to the contract.
We are completing our comparison of the Peoples/MCN contracts - the MCN 
contract is much better (guarantees, liquidated damages etc.) but of course 
power output is less.
3. We kicked off Agra to prepare our permit amendment (using data from both 
the Peoples N2's and MCN N2's).
4. NEPCO capital cost estimate will be ready June 9th.  It looks like $2-3 MM 
will come out of the base estimate for the N1's due to the acceleration and 
winter work coming out.  They still have to do the N2 estimate.  There might 
be a chance to push this ahead to the end of the 7th if we were to pressure 
them more.
5. We feel we can increase our N1 output up by 6 MW at 90F without 
incremental O&M.  The Peoples units would add an incremental 40 MW at 90F.

Using the Peoples units our capital per kW at 90 F is $397 US/kW (using our 
original $156 MM incl. IDC estimate less $2 MM).
Using the MCN units our capital per kW at 90F is $443 US/kW.

Issues:
1. We are not getting great support from Houston in many areas, with the 
exception of some like Don Miller/Genco.  It appears that some groups like 
underwriting/RAC and structuring either are getting the message this project 
is not going ahead, or are taking our continued delays in approval to work on 
all of their other priorities (hoping that we will go away presumably...).  
Schedule becomes more of a concern every day.
2. The Ontario interconnection timing becomes more and more of a concern each 
day that passes as OH isn't the fastest working entity.  Aleck and Duncan 
continue to work the IMO/OHSC/OEB angles but with some of the rules not set 
yet we may need higher level pressure at some time soon.  I'll let you know.

I do think DealBench was extremely valuable - and I'll say we - ENA - but 
what I really mean is you could not have gotten there nearly as quickly 
without it.  I think you agree.  By the same token, if they said 'free' up

Don

Congrats on your deals. JinSung had apprised me that things went well and in 
San Antonio I ran into Dave Delainey and he was very happy with the whole 
thing.

With the current NetWorks structure, and considering the benefits you have 
derived, we want to charge you a nominal amount for each of these data 
rooms.  We want to bill you 25k for each data room for a total of 175k.

I know that at the beginning of the deal you had asked me this question and 
my answer was 'we aint charging you' but the business model for us has 
changed and we need to show revenues and income to external customers and 
external partners we are trying to get to.  Hence we want to bill internal 
customers whatever is the reasonable price of the service offered.

I will call you later to discuss ( I did mention to Dave in San Antonio I was 
going to have to do this, considering my business situation)



Harry

Rob,this deal is not dead; I am primarly waiting on NEPCO numbers.

You should be moving down the road on the deconstruction, refurbishment and 
movement of the NB machines.   You should also be doing any development work 
(permits, interconnection agreements et al) you need to do to maintain the 
optionality of this project (let me know if the expenses get above $1MM).

Randy, please facilitate. Mike, can we put the screws to ABB given the 
significant transformer business we forwarded their way?

Laura, we probably need to make a call on the Peoples turbine pretty soon.

Eric/Rob, I think we need to see the project with IDC come in  between 350 to 
400/kw to be viable or I need a very detailed analysis of why it costs 
significantly more than a Frame 7 machine in the US markets.

I would like see us make this work.

Subject: Moore Power Plant status

The following is a status update of key current items:
1. We continue to try to confirm the viability of the Peoples units.  We have 
not received NOx versus water injection data.  We still have not received the 
full noise spectrum data.  It looks like the only source for this is ABB and 
they're not fast.  Peoples and ourselves are going after ABB on these issues 
(and the possibility of a change order on the exciter design which doesn't 
meet Ontario specs).
 - we have confirmed that the municipality can provide 600 USGPM of water, 
but the silica content has to be confirmed to see if it's a problem.  I met 
with Terra Industrial Tuesday and they remain interested in providing the 
treated water, but they would have to expand their treatment plant.  They can 
provide 1/3rd of the water required and their permit can handle the waste 
stream on regen for the full water flow - we're sorting out the optimum tank 
capacity versus treatment plant capacity sizing to meet reliability at 
minimum cost.  Bottom line is we've got options to handle this water flow and 
we can avoid trying to get a permit for waste water.
 - we're going to use the noise consultant EE&CC used in conjunction with 
Agra Envir. in Canada to sort out the low frequency noise problem, and check 
the other frequencies against our nearest receptor, once we get the data from 
ABB.
 - Peoples are checking with ABB on the possibility of a change order on the 
exciter design.
2. MCN/Columbus have come back on the other two N2 units - they want another 
$1 MM US and can't confirm any changes to the contract.
We are completing our comparison of the Peoples/MCN contracts - the MCN 
contract is much better (guarantees, liquidated damages etc.) but of course 
power output is less.
3. We kicked off Agra to prepare our permit amendment (using data from both 
the Peoples N2's and MCN N2's).
4. NEPCO capital cost estimate will be ready June 9th.  It looks like $2-3 MM 
will come out of the base estimate for the N1's due to the acceleration and 
winter work coming out.  They still have to do the N2 estimate.  There might 
be a chance to push this ahead to the end of the 7th if we were to pressure 
them more.
5. We feel we can increase our N1 output up by 6 MW at 90F without 
incremental O&M.  The Peoples units would add an incremental 40 MW at 90F.

Using the Peoples units our capital per kW at 90 F is $397 US/kW (using our 
original $156 MM incl. IDC estimate less $2 MM).
Using the MCN units our capital per kW at 90F is $443 US/kW.

Issues:
1. We are not getting great support from Houston in many areas, with the 
exception of some like Don Miller/Genco.  It appears that some groups like 
underwriting/RAC and structuring either are getting the message this project 
is not going ahead, or are taking our continued delays in approval to work on 
all of their other priorities (hoping that we will go away presumably...).  
Schedule becomes more of a concern every day.
2. The Ontario interconnection timing becomes more and more of a concern each 
day that passes as OH isn't the fastest working entity.  Aleck and Duncan 
continue to work the IMO/OHSC/OEB angles but with some of the rules not set 
yet we may need higher level pressure at some time soon.  I'll let you know.

Rob, thanks for the update - I am assuming that you will come up with $23M 
Cdn ($16M USD) - "highly likely" with PML.  We do not have recorded in the 
financial statements the $8M Cdn in done deals - you may want to look into 
that.  

We need the money to show up given every other Enron group is flaking - bail

Dave, Origination & Finance has booked roughly C$8MM Quarter to Date.  

For the remainder of the quarter, I will attempt to give you a break-down 
based on probability:

"Highly Likely"
Done Deals    C$8MM
Papier Masson Service Fee Income C$1MM
PCOG Strategic Alliance Extension C$2MM
Chippawa Capacity Assignment  C$1MM
Misc. Marketing Deals   C$1MM
Total     C$13MM

"Probable"
Papier Masson Write-up/Monetization C$10MM (ECC's share only)
MAP Auction    C$2MM
Blue Range Final Dividend  C$1MM
Calpine Capacity Assignment  C$2MM (ECC's share only)
Total     C$15MM

"Unclear"
Tax Mitigation    C$10MM
Turbine Sale    C$2MM
Clarica Funding Deal for PPA  C$1MM
Total     C$13MM

Papier Masson is proceding nicely,as the owners have agreed to sell the asset 
. The owners have also agreed to a structure in principle, whereby they have 
determined a range that they are willing to sell at. If enron exceeds the 
range, they are bound to sell it to Houston P&P group. If we bid inside the 
range they then have 8 weeks to shop us, and if they dont receive any offers, 
enron buys the mill at our bid less C$5MM. If they shop us and receive a 
third party offer, they pay enron a break fee of C$5MM. If they close with a 
third party, we receive an additional C$10MM. At a minimum, this provides us 
with a fair market valuation by an independent/outside party that we can use 
as our basis for writing up the asset. Secondly, it allows the P&P group to 
bid without being a stalking horse as it provides for hefty break fees and 
significant earnings on closing. 

With regards to tax mitigation, I will have a better idea by the end of this 
week. The tax guys are up from Houston and we will be working on it the 
remainder of the week.

fyi...British Energy is now worth >C$100MM at the desk's bid. We are still 
working toward a May 1, 2001 market opening. Support for a may 1 start is 
mounting and has become a very public topic consistently referring to May 1.

Milnthorp

This spreadsheet should have everything for west power (Portland and San Fran) and for all people in Portland.  I have prepared it in a way so that it can be easily sorted.  Chris and I have reviewed and think that it is complete.

Jeanie, could you please ensure that the following people are on a netco list somewhere:
Dan Dietrich
Steve Walton
Murray O'Neil
Terry Donovan
Dale Furrow

Also, I think that Jeff Dasovich is slated to stay in San Fran to support the west gas desk.  I don't know if anyone has considered retention for him.

Finally, I put numbers down for the IT Development people in Portland.  I have no idea if those numbers are good or not.  Please run them by Steve Nat or compare them to someone in a similar role to see if they make sense.

PS - The outside e-mail address is my home e-mail so that I can review if you need me to discuss later.

Subject: Enron Direct Canada-First Deal

Harold;

We have today closed our first retail transaction that is a five year 
exclusive gas supply arrangement with Boardwalk Equities, the largest 
apartment building owner in Alberta.  We will be serving 20,000 apartment 
suites with an annual consumption of 1.5 bcf.  The 5 year margin will be 
approximately $1.5 million.  As a result of our direct instructions, 
Boardwalk lobbied the government to provide them with $2.8 million dollars in 
rebates over the next 4 months to shield them from the higher gas prices.  
These rebates will be paid through Enron Direct as the retailer for Boardwalk.

The gas begins flow on March 1.  We are working on other large building 
owners and restaurant chains and expect to close 2 or 3 more deals for flow 
of March 1. Cadillac Fairview is committed to working with us on a gas 
contract within the next 2 weeks.   We now have a strong platform to grow 
quickly, from a standing start one month ago.

Although the government effectively delayed the opening of the retail power 
market for one year through a price cap, we have been able to grasp a first 
mover advantage on retailing natural gas in Alberta.  We expect to have a 
strong retail delivery organization built by mid year, with 35 staff managing 
a significant number of commercial customers.

The current pricing environment creates a large opportunity to sell 5 year 
fixed price product with significant margins.  Atco, the gas utility is 
getting bad press for not offering hedging instruments, and are cooperating 
with us to assist us in getting established as a retailer.  

This has been a very large effort in the last month, as we needed to get 
licensed, and get legal agreements in place where there were no precedents to 
look at.  We are excited at the prospects for a substantial business 
developing very quickly here in Alberta.  The Enron Canada analytical, risk 
management, regulatory and legal staff have provided great assistance to 
allow us to execute this transaction in a short period.

Regards.

Dave

Dave -

FYI.  

While comprehensive electricity reform legislation looks very dead, there are 
those that are pushing "stand-alone" legislation before Congress.  Attached 
is a letter that Enron will sign on to that opposes stand-alone PUHCA 
reform.   This bill is being pushed by Mid-American.

Government Affairs continues to oppose all stand-alone legislation.  
Basically our only real leverage is to keep PUHCA, PURPA, reliability, and 
wholesale access legislation linked in a comprehensive bill.  This may incent 
the holdouts to agree to our needs.

If you need any additional information, please let me know.

Thanks,

Body:
During the past few days several people have approached us wondering why we are continuing to do college recruiting and continuing with the floor build out given the state of the company today.  We appreciate people's concerns about adding people and spending money at a time when we ought to be reducing unnecessary expenses.  Let us begin by saying that we share these concerns and are not hiring people or undertaking significant capital expenditures without a great deal of thought.  We would also encourage people to talk to their manager or either of us if you don't understand why we are doing certain things.  In short, we have decided to continue with the college recruiting, although we have not yet decided how many, if any, we will hire.  We have decided to delay the beginning of the floor build out for a couple of weeks.

Why Are We Continuing With College Recruiting?
During the last few years we have made tremendous progress establishing a presence for Enron broadly and the Portland office specifically with leading schools in the northwest.  This past year we finally reached critical mass and had tremendous success in our recruiting efforts.  Although we are uncertain about our hiring needs this year, we feel that it is in our best long term interest to continue having a presence with the schools in the northwest.  We have already made presentations and done initial screenings at most schools.  We have identified the best people from each school and have already made plans for them to come to our office for two super Saturdays.  The cost to us to finish this process is not large compared to the benefit that we gain from honoring our commitment to the schools and students as participants in their on-campus recruiting programs.  We also realize that it is a hard year to be coming out of school looking for a job.  It is our belief that students would rather interview with us even if the possibilities of employment may be somewhat diminished.  Finally, we would like to emphasize the point that we have not yet committed to hiring anybody.  We will interview people, identify the best candidates, and make hiring decisions based on the needs of the office.  Before extending offers we will consider the potential impact that it could have on people in this office and Enron employees in other offices who have been redeployed.  Stated another way, we don't intend to hire a bunch of new people if there are people within Enron who could fill positions or if it would put the jobs of the people already here at risk.  We may end up postponing hiring decisions until we are more certain about the state of affairs in the company.

How Will the Floor Move Play Out?
We have decided to postpone the floor build out for a few weeks.  While we still think that it makes sense for the office, we have decided to pause for a couple of weeks before we start to spend significant amounts of money on this.  When talking to the build out team today it became clear that delaying would accomplish several goals.  First, it allows us to get final architectural plans in place and firm quotes from contractors so that we can more precisely peg down the costs before moving forward.  Second, it gives the build out team breathing room to iron out more of the details of the move.  Finally, it buys us a little more time to decide whether or not it makes sense to do this project given the state of affairs of the company right now.  While we still think that we are going to move forward with this project, it seems like buying a couple of weeks of time is the right thing to do right now.  In about two weeks we will reconvene with the build out team with firm budget numbers and make a decision to either move ahead, cancel, or delay again.  

As always, we will try to keep people updated on things as soon as new, reliable information becomes available.  We recognize that this is a very hard time for everyone.  Please try to stay focused on the job at hand and keep up the success of this office.

Larry and Joe, 

Is there any additional moral pressure that we can put on Westinghouse to get 
the resources needed to expedite the resolution of the Gleason 501FD issues  
and the vibration issues at Wheatland?  The phone call by Larry to GE has 
made a world of difference.

Subject: Re: Gleason Blade Ring Schedule  

Mark,

We have been working diligently with Westinghouse to get a schedule for the 
removal and modification of the blade rings at Gleason.  I requested 
Westinghouse begin to prepare for this work on Sunday after you confirmed 
that we could no longer tolerate the operating restriction being added to the 
unit.  Based on discussions with Westinghouse on Sunday, we estimated that 
the work could be completed in 14 days.  The site began disassembly of unit 
#2 on Monday.  Unit #1 disassembly began on Tuesday because we had to wait 
for the unit to cool down.  

The first verbal schedule from Westinghouse was received Monday night.  It 
showed the blade rings being machined in series at a single shop and resulted 
in the lasy unit being delayed about 4 days.  I told Westinghouse this would 
not be acceptable and that the blade rings needed to be machined in 
parallel.  Westinghouse agreed and has made a second shop available.  Another 
schedule was published yesterday afternoon that required an additional step 
in the disassembly that I felt was not required and added a day to the 
duration.  Westinghouse suggested that we remove the compressor blades from 
the rotor before we remove the blade rings.  I have since concluded that 
removing the rotor blades first is in fact the correct procedure. 

As we discussed at the meeting this morning, this schedule for the blade 
rings, which has been at the site since last night,  will be distributed to 
everyone today.  In addition, the site will incorporate the remaining startup 
activities and issue an integrated schedule tonight.

As we discussed at the meeting this morning, it is very unlikely that Gleason 
#1 and #2 can be available by June 1.  Our optimistic estimate from the 
meeting this morning was June 4-7.

Gavin

Subject: Gleason Blade Ring Schedule

John/Gavin -

We have made progress over the last week in getting GE attention focused on 
the emissions problems at Lincoln.  After 6 days of daily conferences on the 
subject, GE has arrived in force at Lincoln, with the personnel and resources 
required to address the problem.  We are not out of the woods yet, but I 
believe everything is now being done that can be done to get as many machines 
available as possible by June 1.

Enron needs the same focus from Westinghouse, on  issues currently plagueing 
Wheatland and Gleason.  Unlike Lincoln, where the machines are capable of 
producing MW's, these two sites have units that cannot operate.  Namely, 
vibration issues on units 1 and 2 at Wheatland and compressor blade ring 
issues on units 1 and 2 at Gleason.

ENA has been requesting since Monday this week, a definitve and complete 
schedule from EECC, showing the disassembly, shipping, machining, reassembly 
and testing of units 1 and 2 blade rings at Gleason.  We still do not have 
this schedule.  Furthermore, it would appear that after this morning's 
meeting, there is some confusion on what work actually needs to be performed 
in order to accomplish this task and what impact that may have on the 14-day 
schedule committed to ENA by Gavin Gaul on 5/15.  I am not sure whether the 
communication breakdown is between business units at Westinghouse or between 
Enron and Westinghouse, but a schedule and plan is the first step towards 
getting the work done and we are two days into the work.  I am expecting this 
plan to be circulated today.

Lastly, although we have been verbally assured by Westinghouse that there 
will be no operating restrictions, other than routine borescope inspections 
during off-peak periods, OEC would be more comfortable getting this in 
writing.  We are requesting a formal notice from Westinghouse, identifying 
any operational restrictions (post-blade ring repair) on these units.

If there is any assistance you require, please do not hesitate to request 
it.  We collectively have 14 days to declare all 15 units ready for 
commercial operation.

By the way, I spoke to Chris Foster and Greg Wolfe about the relative merits 
of Steve Hall and Shari Stack.  Their thinking was that Steve is probably a 
better "deep thinker" (to use Elizabeth's words) but that he might be bored 
with the routine transaction work that Shari seems to really enjoy.  He also 
doesn't have the ISDA background which would provide tremendous benefit to 
us.  Therefore, I think Shari is a better fit for our current needs.  

Having said that, I am extremely impressed with Steve.  He has a better 
handle on this California work than anyone I've worked with yet.  He seems 
really bright and responsive.  I talked to him last week about working for 
Enron and he seemed interested.  I didn't get into any details about our 
needs, but gauged his general level of interest in the work that he is doing 
for us and his willingness to consider jobs other than his current one.  He 
basically said that he would be happy to hear about opportunities here.  I 
was talking to Richard Sanders yesterday and he also is impressed with Steve 
and said that he had considered trying to hire him.  I don't know if there is 
a position for Steve or not.  I just wanted to give you feedback on my 
discussions with him.  Let me know if you need any help or information from 
me on this matter.

Guys, to end all arguments, I would suggest the following protocol which is 
similar to what was discussed at Columbia Lakes:

 a) P&P swaps and anything to do with the network strategy/assets in the 
paper sector in Canada and Mexico - Industrial Origination;
 b) Pure energy commodity positions and stand-alone energy assets (no 
outsourcing) for all industrial segments in Canada and Mexico - ECC or Enron 
Mexico; 
 c) Energy outsourcing for all industrial segments in Canada and Mexico - I 
would like Enron Canada and Enron Mexico to develop a written target list in 
which ECC, Enron Mexico and the Industrial Origination groups would work 
together to develop, sell and execute on the most profitable and value adding 
outsourcing product for the industrial customer in Canada and Mexico - ECC 
and Enron Mexico's understanding of the energy markets in Canada and Mexico 
coupled with the customer facing, product development and execution skills in 
Houston should provide a winning team.  I am asking for the three teams to 
clearly identify the outsourcing targets, lead sales and structuring people 
and the timing as far as starting discussion with each target customer 
(ASAP).  I would hope that the Mexican and Canadian teams would lead the 
sales process and the Houston team lead the structuring, customer facing and 
execution but I will let you decide the optimum mix.  Either way, I am 
expecting this target list completed and agreed to in the next two weeks for 
Canada and Mexico;
 and d) for Tembec I don't think it makes sense to change the deal team at 
this point; however, the US team will keep the Canadian team in the loop and 
if the products become non-outsourcing related the deal should be passed to 
ECC.

Delainey

Subject: Tembec and US Originators

Rodney, Edward, Jim - We've been over this issue a number of times and I 
thought we had reached resolution when we last met with Delainey.  My 
understanding with respect to coverage of Canadian Industrials is as follows:

1.) ENA to take lead on industrials that have facilities in both US and 
Canada and will co-ordinate coverage with ECC with respect to Canadian 
Facilities.

2.) ECC to take lead on industrials that have Canadian Facilities only.

3.) With respect to Canadian Pulp & Paper Industrials, ENA will cover Pulp & 
Paper Swaps and SPV structuring.  ECC will cover these industrials for all 
other Enron products (i.e. power, gas, services, etc.) Again, coverage needs 
to be co-ordinated.

Specific to Tembec, I share Paul's concerns on why ENA would send 2 people to 
talk to Tembec re: outsourcing when Tembec is across the hall from ECC, ECC 
has an established relationship, and Tembec is a Canadian Company with no US 
facilities.

It is my hope that we can resolve this amongst ourselves without having to 
get Dalainey involved. I would suggest a conference call next week.  In the 
interim, Paul will forward a CA to Tembec in contemplation of an outsourcing 
arrangement.

Subject: Tembec and US Originators

Rob, We just had a very good meeting with Tembec about Energy procurement and 
energy outsourcing.  While the meeting went well, I am very confused about 
the Enron team making the pitch to them.  My understanding is that the 
Canadian originators - particularly the Toronto team for Eastern Canadian 
companies will be responsible for everything except for pulp and paper swaps 
and to some extent, new SPV's.

In this instance,

1.  Tembec is a Canadian Company
2.  All their assets are in Canada
3.  Jan has been working with Tembec people in their largest facility
4.  We know the executive team at Tembec
5.  We clearly are very knowleadgable in all aspects of the Ontario energy 
market which is their focus right now
6.  We understand and are pitching the overall energy outsourcing arrangement 
similar to the US pitches

With this in mind, I am not sure why Kellie Metcalf and Bob Anderson flew up 
here (6 hours flight time there and back, $4,000 to $5,000 in flights and 
hotels) for a 4 hour meeting with Tembec.  Kelly was quite vocal in saying 
that this is a client they want to serve out of Houston.  I have stated to 
her that that does not make any sense in terms of efficiency and costs and 
knowledge of the market where Tembec's assets are.  Obviously, much of the 
technical engineering work would and should be done by the engineering team 
put together in the Industrial Services Group should a deal be struck.  
However, the commercial negotiations and marketing should be led by this 
office!!!

I thought this had been agreed to already.  We managed to piece up the 
meeting and deliver the "Enron" message, but going forward we need to have 
this resolved.


Cheers, Paul D

I understand that the lease assignment needs to happen.  However, it is my understanding from talking directly to the landlord that they are modifying the lease to require us to pay for certain separatioon costs and upgrades to their facilities (e.g., security access to all of their floors in this building).  The landlord has also agreed, in concept, to provide us a six month option at the beginning of the term.  

Based on discussions with you yesterday, it seemed that UBSW was not willing to insert any of the language that I wanted into the lease (e.g., six month option to get out), but was willing to insert language that the landlord wanted (obligating UBSW to several $100k of costs).  Why would UBSW do this?  

I recommend that we either (1) make the landlord's changes and my changes this week or (2) make no changes this week and work to get the lease that both sides want next week.

CONFIDENTIAL:
Tim,
As discussed the Portland Lease is proposed to be assigned from Enron 
North America Corp. to UBS AG (or UBS Warburg Energy LTD.). The 
bankruptcy judge has only approved a full assignment and therefore a 
partial assignment (e.g. for the 3rd floor for 15,615.64 rsf) would not 
be possible. Enron in turn is expected to sublease the 4th floor 
(5,563.11 rsf). This Assigment of this Lease Agreement requires the 
written consent of the Landlord (Portland General Electric Company), 
which should be received within 30 days. All lease agreements with 
Enron (including Portland) are expected to be executed this week as 
part of the Legal Closing, scheduled for 2/08/02.
We understand that the Landlord would like to recapture our space ASAP. 
The longer term space needs may only be approx. 10,000 rsf. Therefore a 
relocation may be feasible. However it is my understanding that issues 
related to a possible relocation would be discussed with all parties 
involved (incl. Landlord) only after the Legal Closing.

Markus

Hi John- thanks for the generous offer which I have accepted.  A couple of outstanding questions- 

1. Who am I reporting to?  I would welcome the opportunity to report to you or Greg.  I think my job was a lot easier in the past because our group had the backing of the Office of the Chair. This gave us credibility, independence, and the chance to contribute to strategic issues as well as the tactical issues of interest to the traders. However, I am obviously open to any reporting relationship you might suggest and I understand that my day-to-day duties will consist largely of interaction with the Fundy teams.

2. Are there any slots that have opened because of offers that were not accepted?  I would love to be able to take one of the folks from my group with me, particularly Kristin Walsh or my assistant Sharon Purswell.

Thanks again for the great offer and the chance to join UBS.

Chris and I would like to take this opportunity to update everyone on what has been happening on the floor(s) during the last couple of weeks and what is likely to transpire in the weeks to come.  I'd like to begin by apologizing for the lack of broad e-mail communications or floor meetings over the last couple of weeks.  These have been very hard times and I know that people have wanted information.  It has taken us nearly a week to sort through who will be part of the UBS Warburg team and who continue with Enron.  

In this e-mail I will explain: (1) who will be going to UBS Warburg, (2) who do the people working for Enron work for and what are they expected to do, (3) how will the physical separation between Enron and UBS Warburg happen, and (4) when will the sale of Netco to UBS Warburg be completed.  In addition to Chris Calger and me, the following Portland-based employees have accepted positions with UBS Warburg:

Last Name	First Name	Last Name	First Name	
Amador	Susan	Oh	John	
Anderson	John	Platter	M	
Bulbes	Victor	Postlethwaite	John	
Chang	Fang-Tzu	Richter	Jeffrey	
Chatterton	Jill	Robinson	Donald	
Crandall	Sean	Salisbury	Holden	
Cutsforth	Diane	Scholtes	Diana	
Dasovich	Jeff	Semperger	Cara	
Davidson	Debra	Sheidun	Donna	
Dean	Craig	Shields	Jeffrey	
Dunton	Heather	Slinger	Ryan	
Etringer	Michael	Solberg	Geir	
Gilbert	Michael "Scotty"	Steiner	David	
Gustafson	Mollie	Stokley	Marlin "Chris"	
Hall	Stephen	Swain	Stephen	
Heizenrader	Timothy	Swerzbin	Michael	
Kandaswamy	Balachandar	Thomas	Jacob	
Lackey	Christopher	Thome	Stephen	
Lee	Eugene	Van Houten	Maria	
Mallory	Patrick "Chris"	Villeggiante	Theresa	
McDonald	Michael	Wente	Laura	
Meyer	James	Williams	William J	
Meyers	Albert	Woodland	Andrea	
Mier	Michael	Yoder	Christian	
Nelson	Kourtney			

While there are a few people who are still making up their minds, the rest of the people in our office will be working for the Enron estate.  It is not entirely clear to me right now what the management team for west power looks like for the Enron estate now.  As I understand it, there are two primary initiatives on the estate side that people in Portland may be a part of.  The first is the disposition of our development projects that are already well under way.  Dave Parquet in San Francisco has been leading this effort together with the Portland asset development team.  This effort has been ongoing since December.  The second is the disposition of our west power commodity positions.  Jim Fallon is in charge of this for the entire company.  People working on this for Jim include Don Miller, Paul Racicot, Brad Richter, Ed Baughman among others.  I have placed a call to Jim and to Paul to get advice on how people in Portland should proceed.  I would recommend talking to Ed, Brad, Paul, or Don to get direction.  I have placed a call to several of these people to get direction and am waiting for a response.  I am hopeful that they will designate a lead person in Portland to coordinate the power procurement and delivery efforts.

As most of you know, the physical separation between UBS Warburg and Enron has already begun.  People who will continue to work for Enron will be located on the 4th Floor, while UBS Warburg will occoupy the 3rd Floor.  We hope to make the moves to the 4th Floor by the end of this week.  Moves within the 3rd Floor will take place the following week.

The UBS Warburg transaction is subject to one last pro forma regulatory hurdle.  While I don't have an exact date, I am told that it will likely be on or about February 6th.

Finally, I want to once again thank everyone for their help and cooperation over the last few weeks.  These have been really horrible times as the Enron story continues to unfold in the news at the same time that people are finding out about their future with Enron and UBS.  I know that this hasn't been easy for anyone.  I am deeply saddened overseeing the breakup of the awesome team that we have put together.  Whether you are going to UBS, remaining with Enron, or leaving the company, I wish everyone who worked on this team the best in their future endeavors.  It has been a distinct honor to work with each and every one of you.

Regards,
Tim

Jay,

I've always taken a pretty laid back approach to the noncompete when there is little overlap.  Having said that, however, I'd like to keep a "last veto" right - just give me a call when you've got something.

Good luck to you in the future, Jay.  You'll be missed at Enron.

Best regards,
Jeff

Subject:	My Resignation, and a Question

Jeff-

As you may know, I have (somewhat reluctantly) decided to resign from Enron.  For some time now, I have wanted to take some time off, and had asked Whalley about the possibility for a six month unpaid, unvested sabbatical.  Primarily for reasons of precedence, he was unwilling to pursue this option, which, while it is disappointing to me, I accept.

The purpose of this note is twofold.

First, I would like to thank you for making this company the great place it is today, and for giving me the opportunity to have a great career here.  I will forever look upon my nine plus years with Enron fondly.

Second, I would like to ask you as the administrator of the 1997 Long Term Incentive Plan to allow me to explore opportunities in the venture capital community without triggering non-compete provisions with regard to future payouts.  I very much enjoyed my brief role in venture capital, and have some very good contacts in that area here in New York.  Since NetWorks decided to cease operations in that business earlier in the year, I should not think that Enron would view anything I might do there as competitive, especially if I were not working directly in the energy space with an Enron competitor.

At present, I am planning to spend my time at least through the summer enjoying, and travelling with, my family.  I have nothing planned professionally as of yet, but wanted to take the opportunity to drop you this note while I might still be viewed positively (I hope that's not too presumptuous!).

Please let me know your thoughts on this non-compete provision as I would not wish for anything to be awkward for us going forward.

Again Jeff, thanks for many great memories, and as an Enron shareholder, keep up the great work!

Jay

Thanks for the analysis, Mary.  It does a lot to clarify the context within 
which the PX is conducting their investigation.  If your analysis is right, 
it seems like the PX has virtually nothing to stand on.  But why do they 
continue to pursue a course of action that seems inconsistent with their 
tariff and FERC's recent rulings?  Why do you think the PX believes that they 
have a case (or the right to publish a letter about us) against us??  Before 
we meet with Sladoje, I'd like to get a better understanding of their 
legal/regulatory side of the argument.

She tendered her resignation this morning.  Intends to sit out for noncompete period.  Don't think that she has secured a new job yet, but will likely show up with Calpine or AEP in Portland sometime in Q4.  Probably has a verbal commitment from Wolfe to work with him wherever he lands.  Haven't had exit interview yet.  Most likely leaving due to money.  Hate to lose her, but Foster and Swerzbin are ok with it.

I will call Wolfe today and tell him about Holli and directly ask him if he is leaving based on this new information.

Subject: Deal Update

Dave,

Update from Friday Afternoon:

Coyote:  Avista Board approved a 50% equity investment in Coyote Springs II 
and publicly announced their intention to move forward.  Their equity 
partner, BP Amoco, indicated that they need 30 more days to "get comfortable 
with the market".  This thirty day period coincides with the expected 
financial close of June 15 so it may just be posturing to let us know that 
they are not committed until the deal actually closes.  Nevertheless, we 
(Avista and Enron) will pursue fallback investors that have already seen the 
project and previously expressed interest in a 50% share.  In parallel, we 
will try to get BP Amoco "comfortable".  It might make sense to consider 
someone else that can move quickly.  Deal probability drops from 80% to 50%.

LVCogen:  Vickers and Gilbert met with Sierra Pacific and confirmed their 
interest in and ability to effect a restructuring of the PPA.  Although 
timing of "securitization" is open-ended, Sierra has agreed to a contract 
valuation that supports a valuation uplift of $10MM - $14MM.  If we assume a 
40%-50% probability of restructuring, we get to the hotlisted $5MM gain for 
QII.   Attached is a spreadsheet that shows the breakup value of LVCogen.  
CTG and Power Structuring are finalizing the RAC models that support this 
approach.

Regards,

Chris

I know how incredibly busy you all are, so I'm sure that making a pledge to Jeff for the MS150 has simply slipped your mind.  Well the ride is this weekend, time is running out and we need you!

Enron's goal is to raise $700,000, and Jeff's personal goal is to raise $50,000.  As of today, we are a little better than half way there.  Won't you consider helping him reach his goal?

Thanks for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing from you tomorrow...

Sherri :-)

Like most people, I heard on the news that the auction is done and that the winner is UBS.  I have not received confirmation of this from my management.  As soon as I hear anything official I will call a floor meeting to share what I know.

If I hear nothing official by 2 PM I'll hold a floor meeting at that time to share what I know (or perhaps don't know).  I am hopeful that we will have information within a couple of hours.  Stay tuned.

I hope the data on these performance reviews is wrong.  I think we need 100% 
of reviews done.  Do you agree.

Attached, for your information is a matrix reflecting the status of completed 
reviews from the mid-year 2000 process.  This is broken down by ENA 
organization units, as they were structured at mid-year, prior to the 
creation of EGM and EIM.

I will provide you with a weekly update on the status.

Please call me at X36628 should you have any questions.

Body:
Mary lynne, thanks for the numbers.  It is exactly the information that I was hoping for.

I ran some quick totals on the data.  Here is what I saw for the commercial customers:
72,559 MWh delivered for commercial during this time period.
Total positive CTC owed to utility of $1,749,741
Average CTC for these customers of $24.11/MWh


Without opining on whether we owe these or not, I still need to figure out whether they've been booked and if so how, and as more come in we need to figure out what to do with them.  A few accounting/booking questions:
Have these been booked as a payable to PG&E
Do we think that they can be offset against any negative ctc's that PG&E owes us.
Is there a clean process in place for tracking and booking these.
Can we do a flash vs. actual on these volumes for the time period.
Who has the schedule of historic negative CTC receivalbles and what the accounting treatment has been?
I think we need to prepare a "one stop shopping" binder or folder with all of the positive and negative ctc information going back through time.  Perhaps this has been done already, but I haven't seen it.

A couple other questions / observations:
Steve, do we have any idea how they calculate this?
In September we will receive charges of approximately $14.6 million applying our load against a $24/MWh CTC.
JIm, what is our process at the CPUC to dispute these charges and clarify PG&E's methodology?
I need to get a handle on this ASAP.

Attached is the CTC file for STAT (EESO).  It is basically the same as the last file I send with EEMC data except that we pulled in the residential/commercial indicator so I could split residential out.

Subject: Project 20/20 Status

Julie and Jean,
Pursuant to our telephone conversation this morning, this e-mail is intended 
to update the status of project 20/20.
There are 6 major items that need to be completed prior to closing this 
transaction.  The items and the expected completion dates are outlined below:

Closing Item   Expected Completion Date Status
1. Execution of LOU  August 4   Several issues remain to be negotiated.
        I do not anticipate any problem in reaching mutual agreement on the 
issues.
        Border meets with their audit committee on August 2 and hopes to sign 
August 3.
        Will be in the position to review with you and Dave on August 1 or 2.

2. Employment Issues  August 14   Offers of employment/transfer are in the 
process of being designed and prepared. Primary         issues include a) 
identification and handling of ENA end-of-year bonus compensation 
(Shiela         Knudson is coordinating this and I feel this issue is being 
adequately addressed).
        b) potential disparity between GPG and ENA incentive compensation 
plans. I am working with Bill         Cordes and Ann Vaughn w/ GPG on 
developing a plan that will address this issue.  Based on the         
conference call with Bill and Ann this morning, I am optimistic that this 
issue will be properly         addressed.  The plan is to have employment 
issues identified in a letter and presented to          employees on August 
7th.

3. Reserve Consultants  August 11   Kicked off consultants in a meeting in 
Omaha on July 26th. We are providing information and         assisting in the 
process.

4. Due Diligence  August 25   A detailed schedule of all due diligence 
activity is being updated by Northern Border and I will         forward that 
schedule to you once I receive the update.

5. Hart, Scott Rodino  September 8-15   There is a high probability that a 
Hart, Scott, Rodino filing will have to be made upon execution of         the 
LOU. There is a 30 day review period.  This may be the critical path item.

6. Drafting/Negotiating PSA September 8-15   Shonnie Daniel is coordinating 
the drafting of the Purchase and Sale Agreement. It is expected         that 
this agreement will be agreed upon in early to mid September.

One key date you should be aware of is Northern Border is anticipating making 
a press release after the LOU is executed (release date is expected to be 
August 7).  They will be coordinating press release issues with Eric Thode.

I feel confident that this transaction will be closed in September. 

If you have any questions, please let me know.

Jeff,

Thanks for getting back to me.  You probably saved us quite a bit of time and 
money.  

It looks like half of the City of London has been duped into helping E.ON 
fool its shareholders.  I wonder how many of their other sales were actually 
auctions versus pre-arranged sales dressed up for the shareholders.

We will start our brainstorming sessions over again with a new rule - no 
Germans!

Thanks again,

Joe

Richard,
Attached, please find my analysis of the PX's position as stated in their 
November 11 and December 21 letters.  Based on my discussions with Greg 
Whalley last week, he was of the opinion that we should send a short letter 
with only a few points refuting the PX's position.  The attached letter goes 
into some detail refuting the PX's allegations.  We should talk on Monday or 
Tuesday to discuss the content of the final letter.  Please note, I have not 
included any of the recent FERC-related developments in my analysis.  Based 
on discussions with Ron Carrol last week it appears that we have another 
avenue to pursue.

John Lavorato confirmed that UBS is indeed the winner.  As I understand it, UBS has come to an agreement with Enron for the purchase of the North America Gas/Power Trading and Marketing organization.  We either have received or are expected to receive approval from the Creditors committee today.  Creditors Committee approval is considered likely as they have been in the loop on this transaction all along.  It will most likely go in front of the judge on Monday.  Approval from the judge is expected.  I have a meeting in the next couple of hour where I will get more details.  Stay tuned ...

The attached PDF file summarizes our view (Mary Hain's and mine) of the 
possible outcomes of taking the PX investigation the FERC route or the PX 
Settlement route.  To make a commercial decision, we need to know what 
jurisdiction we would like this case to be settled in and the rules of 
engagement in each jurisdiction.  For example, if we do a FERC filing we must 
meet a "just and reasonable" standard while if we appeal an ADR decision to 
FERC we have to prove that the ADR finding was "Arbitrary and Capricious."  
Please review the attached file and let me know if any of it is wrong.  
Personally, I need more input from legal and regulatory on what our odds of 
winning our in the different juridictions before I can make an informed 
decision.

Jere, I spoke with Scott on these targets and his belief is that both 
himself, Allen and John have significant relationships with these folks which 
should help leverage your product into this sector. Scott and John have 
agreed to set up these meetings with the decision makers in these targets 
with no delay.  From there, you, John and Scott can determine what deal team 
will go speak to them about the opportunities.  I would expect that we will 
be in front of these folks ASAP.  Lets see how the product is embraced by 
these customers before we extend the target list and create a more formal 
alignment of the groups.  As per your earlier e-mail, I assume you are 
working on the Reeding & Bates opportunity.

Regards
Delainey

Attached is a preliminary list of customers that we would like to contact.  
This list will change as we receive more information from the market.  We are 
available to meet with John and Scott.  This needs to be an ENA team effort.

Mike and I both negotiated contracts with Jim Fallon that originally started in September of 1999 that were to end in September of 2001.  These original contracts were signed, I believe, in October or November of 1999.  They were both done under Enron Corp.  Then, in the beginning of 2000, the contracts were redrafted and done under ENA and extended through the end of 2001.  I think that you are missing the original doc that was done in 1999 that had a signing bonus.  If you look at Sept 99 to Sep of 01 Mike was paid 434 in year 1 and 3?? in year 2.  I have asked Mike to bring in the original doc from 1999 that had the signing bonus.  Perhaps HR might have a copy as well.

Please plan to meet at 1:00 p.m. on Wednesday for an informal question/answer session.  The best place to gather is in the rows between Trading and Origination.  Chris Calger will not be in the office on Wednesday, so I will be conducting the session.

At this point I do not have any significant new information about our company status, but I will relay the latest information that I have.  I know there are many rumors swirling around right now.  I will try to answer any questions that people have.  It would be helpful if people would submit questions in advance.  Although this is not a requirement for asking questions, it would be helpful if you would email questions/rumors to Julie Kearney before the meeting.

Please let me or Debra know if you have any questions.

Please plan to meet at 1:00 p.m. on Wednesday for an informal question/answer session.  The best place to gather is in the rows between Trading and Origination.  Chris Calger will not be in the office on Wednesday, so I will be conducting the session.

At this point I do not have any significant new information about our company status, but I will relay the latest information that I have.  I know there are many rumors swirling around right now.  I will try to answer any questions that people have.  It would be helpful if people would submit questions in advance.  Although this is not a requirement for asking questions, it would be helpful if you would email questions/rumors to Julie Kearney before the meeting.

Please let me or Debra know if you have any questions.

I will be holding an information session on the midyear PRC process.  The purpose of the information session is to provide an overview of the PRC process from selecting reviewers to final PRC meetings in Houston.  New employees may find it useful as I will try to explain how the process works and will attempt to provide some useful background.  People who have been here for a while may also find it useful.  This year I am on the company-wide Performance Review Committee, so I have had the opportunity to provide input into the process and sit in on PRC meetings throughout the company.  I will discuss changes to this year's PRC process and share my observations of how the system works throughout the company.  Most importantly, I want to answer any questions that people have about the PRC process.

Date:  Wednesday, August 8
Time:  2:00 p.m.
Place:  Mt. Hood
Subject:  PRC Process

Let me or Debra know if you have any questions.

Body:
The people on the "To" list have been selected to attend an "Energy Math" 
training session which will be held on March 7th from 9 AM to 5 PM in the 
River Room at Two World Trade Center.  Amy Fitzpatrick will provide you with 
a course outline and background reading (helpful but not mandatory) by Monday 
morning.  We want to have 15 people attend this course.  I realize that this 
is short notice, so if you can't attend please let me know ASAP so that I can 
find a replacement.

I have been working with Jon Koomey, who will be teaching the course, over 
the last couple of months to tailor a training session that will meet the 
needs of people who work on this floor.  The goal is to provide a 
comprehensive overview of computations and analytical tools that are the 
foundation of analyzing energy problems.  The course is loosely based on a 
graduate level course offered at Berkeley (which Jon has taught and several 
people on the floor have taken) and on a book that Jon Koomey recently 
published.

This is the first time that this course, in its current form, is being 
offered.  As a result, it should be viewed as a work in progress.  Chris 
Calger and I would like every person in this office to have the opportunity 
to take this course between now and the end of the year.  We have selected a 
cross-section of people for this first session.  Some people have a lot of 
experience doing analysis while others have little training in this area.  
Some have been working in the energy industry for several years while others 
are new to the business.  We are hoping that the course will be helpful to 
people with different backgrounds.  Each participant in the class is not only 
responsible for learning as much as you can, but is also required to give 
constructive feedback to Jon Koomey and to us on how to make the course 
better.  You will have both formal and informal opportunities to provide 
feedback.  This feedback is part of the program.  If you aren't willing or 
don't feel that you have the time to take this one-day course and provide us 
with thoughtful, constructive suggestions on how to improve the course for 
the next time please let me know and your name will be removed from the list 
for this session.

Based on the feedback from this course, we will make modifications before the 
next course is offered in a month or so.  With your help, we will be able to 
improve the training for the people who come after you.  Thanks in advance 
for your help with this, and I hope that you find this training to be helpful.

Kevin,

I was talking with Louise this afternoon and she said that she does not want us to put full master agreements online, but rather that we should proceed with streamlined GTC's in order to ensure that we are able to do as much business as possible without being delayed by negotiation of lengthy contracts.

This does not mean that we cannot ultimately get everyone onto a standardised long-form Master Agreement. EnronOnline is set up so that a negotiated Master Agreement will supercede the GTC.

Subject:	WSCC Reserve Standard

Tim,

After receiving Dick's message regarding the changes in the WSCC Reserve Standard, I went through the documents to try to understand the change being proposed.  I also made talked with some of the people who have been participants in the development of the new standard, to check on my understanding and ask a few follow-up questions.

While on its face, the reserve requirements are being lowered the standard is actually being tightened, because the new standard deals with the locations at which reserves are covered.  In the past, a party could carry all of its spin on a single unit.  The new standard is based on governor responses to frequency excursion.  It requires that the reserve be spread across more units or that special control features be added to AGC to allow carrying more reserves on some machines.  

As Dick indicated in his note, there is some potential for a reduction in system transfer capability.  For instance, carrying more reserves on NW hydro units in some hydrological conditions has the potential to reduce the Pacific Intertie rating by up to 20%.  However, given the limited reserves available in California, we are probably already in this condition.  With California at 1.5% reserve, there is a concern that the rating is already impacted.  On the other hand, when more generation comes on-line in California with new construction, then the reserve levels rise and the impact on transfer capability is mitigated.  

The other effect of this change is that it reduces the amount of Frequency Response Reserve (FRR) that California has to buy.  Whether the change in the responsibility to buy actually changes to pattern of reserves on machines cannot be determined at present.  However the change does have financial benefits to those who are chronically short of FRR.

Finally, I wondered how the shift to from individual control areas to a single control area with the formation of RTO West would affect the reserve requirements, since the new standard talks about carrying reserves by control area or reserve sharing pool.  I was reminded that the Northwest is a reserve sharing pool.  Since , the Northwest Power Pool and RTO West represent essentially the same portion of the system.  the RTO formation will not result in a major change in requirements.  

If you have additional questions, I will dig deeper.

Steve

Crandall done

Swerzbin submitted comments on Monday;  feedback will be given to him today - some met some not;  Mike's comments on our feedback due on Monday;  should be in a position to execute next week.
Heizenrader is good on numbers and still talking language.  Final issues relate to language about breaking laws or regulations and all of the accusations that are out there about Enron and it's employees breaking laws and regulations.  Michele Cash has talked to Sanders and Haedicke about this stuff.  Tim H., Michele, Amy Fitzpatrick (HR Generalist in PDX) and I met today.  We think that we have arrived at language that will work for everyone.  Ball is in Michele's court to turn another draft around to us.
Belden - I am good on the numbers.  I have have concerns about indemnity against California and West Power related lawsuits.  I also want to formalize the arrangement that I have with Haedicke with respect to Enron covering my legal fees associated with the west power investigations.  Michele is going to take a cut at some language.  She also needs to convince me that I am covered by the Directors and Officers indemnifications which are part of Enron's bylaws and Delaware law.
Richter - he's been lame about giving me his comments.  I've been lame about riding him on it.  I will do that today.
Wolfe - Greg currently is considering offers from Calpine, AEP, and Enron.  AEP is offering significantly more money.  Greg needs to decide where he wants to work and who he wants to work with.  There is a very real chance that we lose him.  However, we've shown his a great bid, so we will just have to get by if he leaves for a lot of money.  When I say a lot, he is talking about guaranteed 600k per year, roughly.
Motley - has declined our offer.  The total numbers looked good, but he doesn't like Enron options.  If we took his Option value and put it into cash or restricted stock he would be done.  I mentioned it to John and he didn't want to do that.  On the one hand, if that will get him done I think that it's a great outcome.  On the other, we showed him some good numbers and I respect the fact that John wants to keep things consistent.  Tough call.  He did mention that if Enron's Treasury department would let him gamma trade his options withodd lots and no margin requirement that he would take the options.  He has a legitimate point that he has no way of assuring that he can achieve the value of the options.  It's also very hard to argue with an options trader on this point.

Subject: Enron North America - Asset Snapshots Q1 2000

Dave:  I am having delivered to your office this afternoon a proof copy of 
our snapshot book for ENA for Q1, 2000.  Before we distribute to others, Rick 
Buy and I thought we should check in with you on the distribution list which 
is included on the letter attached to the snapshots. (also attached below)   
You may recall that last quarter we cut down the distribution considerably by 
requiring anyone who wanted a book to contact us.  The people on the attached 
list were those that specifically requested a book.  One other thing to 
note:  this time we have included overall portfolio and return numbers in the 
front of the book.  This may affect your decision on how you want the book 
distributed within ENA.

Your advice on additions/deletions to the distribution list is appreciated.  
If you have questions, please give me a call.

              Regards,

              Rick C.

The year-end performance review process is upon us.  I will send out a 
complete list of procedures and deadlines in the next few days.  In the 
meantime, we need to get each person's selection for reviewers into the 
system.  Amy Fitzpatrick has kindly volunteered to coordinate this process 
and make sure that all of the information gets into the system.  You need to 
select 5 people from the floor and up to 3 people from off the floor (if you 
have worked with people outside of the Portland office).  You can select 
anybody (except your manager), with the goal of getting 360 degree feedback 
from peers, people who you work with, people whose work you impact, people 
with a higher title, and/or people with a lower title.

HERE IS WHAT I NEED YOU TO DO ASAP (CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON MONDAY AT THE 
LATEST):
Send an e-mail to Amy Fitzpatrick and your manager listing 5 people on the 
floor who you would like to provide feedback on you.
List the people in preference order.
Include up to 3 additional people who are not on the floor, but work at Enron.
Do not include your manager as a reviewer -- your manager already is 
responsible for reviewing your performance.
You do NOT have to enter these names into the PEP system.  We will do it for 
you.

Subject: Ronnie Lee-Walton


I called Ronnie Lee to invite him to the New York Christmas party (he'll 
probably come) and we had a lengthy conversation about what they're doing 
right now.
It sounds like they are down to 4 counterparties on their previous "asset 
management" solicitation:  Enron, Southern, Duke and Williams.  Williams is 
their first choice at the moment purely driven on price. It sounds like 
Williams is willing to effectively provide natural gas at a  below-market 
fixed price. Both Williams and Duke were comparable on price. Enron and 
Southern are close on price and just behind the Duke/Williams pricing. 
Although Ronnie claims everyone is "right there together", the small pricing 
difference is significant when looked at over 15 years. Williams will be with 
Ronnie soon (next couple weeks) to begin discussing contract language. He 
says documents aren't signed and I can tell he really wanted us to be at the 
table. We priced our last deal to him about 4 weeks ago and I believe the gas 
curve was higher than it is currently. Ronnie agrees that it would be 
worthwhile to reprice our deal since the prices were so close before. He said 
Jackson has  now joined Walton, Colquitt, and Satilla and they would like to 
come to terms on a definitive document in the December/January timeframe.  

I talked with him about Oglethorpe and Tom Smith, and he was very interested 
to find out we'd been meeting with them. He thinks Oglethorpe will only keep 
about 40% of the existing Oglethorpe load. He'd like to sit down and talk 
thru all this after we re-price our deal and I told him that Ozzie would be 
in touch to try and set up a time. 

Although I hadn't really planned to call Ronnie on this, I thought it 
probably wouldn't be bad to stir things up a bit!

My name is Tim Belden and I manage the West Power trading desk in Portland.  Louise Kitchen suggested that I get in touch with you.

I spoke to Marcus Beurgler on Tuesday about the Portland office.  I indicated to him our desire to move.  We discussed an interim period in this office until we can move elsewhere.  I learned yesterday that Enron has accepted the lease on this office space.  I was not aware that this was happening and am told that we are now stuck here for the term of the lease which is three to five years.

Based on very preliminary assessment it looks like it may be cost effective to move from here.  We currently occupy 20,000 square feet when we only need roughly 10,000.  If we remain in this building there is a significant cost associated with physically separating our phones and computers from Portland General Electric.  Everyone here would like to move.

What I need to know is the following:
Is UBS Warburg obligated at this point in time to take on the lease for our current space?  If yes, can this be undone?  If no, when will this decision be made?
If we are obligated to take this space, who do I need to talk to within UBS about negotiating with Portland General Electric to get out of the lease.  I have very good relationships with Portland General Electric so I think that they would work with us on this.

I can be reached at 503-464-3820 or 503-701-7278.

Thanks,

Tim, the issue is not on the agenda for the Commission's meeting on November 7.  This is no surprise, however, since written comments are still pending and not due until November 9 (Alan is preparing ours with my back-up).  Pat Wood said at the last Commission meeting that he doesn't wish to issue significant orders between meetings, so it is unlikely that FERC will act before its next scheduled meeting.  There is time pressure because winter is advancing.  Therefore our educated guess is that the order would issue at the next meeting following submittal of the comments, to be held on November 20.  The meeting agenda for this meeting will be available on the 13th or 14th; as soon as it issues we will let you know if it appears on the agenda.  In the meantime, if we hear anything more definitive we will let you know right away.  Ray

Also, do you want this report simply added to the end of the EOL Summary, or

the same volume as the Intercontinental Exchange.  If you want reports like 
this, Justin Rostant can produce whatever you wish.

Yesterday:
ICE   1,892,800 MWhs
EnronOnline 1,843,874 MWhs (plus 124,850 MWhs financial)

Subject: Property Insurance Renewal 3/1/2001

Due to adverse loss experience the insurance market is "hardening" resulting 
in higher rates and more restrictive terms and conditions. Property insurance 
rates are generally rising for everyone and particularly those with poor loss 
experience. Unfortunately, Enron falls in the latter category. In the past, 
not withstanding our loss experience, Enron has enjoyed very competitive 
rates and a deductible of $500,000 for both property damage and business 
interruption (traditionally, property insurance policies contain a monetary 
deductible for property damage plus a day waiting period for business 
interruption (normally 30 to 90 days)).  For the period 1993 through 2000 
Enron paid premiums of approximately $114,100,000 and collected losses of 
approximately $ 212,200.000.  This trend is continuing under the current 
policy which is expiring on 3/1/2001. 

Current renewal terms being offered require an estimated premium of  
$17,000,000 and a deductible of $5,000,000 per loss for property damage and 
business interruption. This is the lowest deductible achievable unless we are 
willing to accept a waiting period for business interruption. 

Realising the potential costs and budgetary and contractual implications 
associated with such a change, we are continuing negotiations and seeking 
alternatives to the current renewal terms. However, we should all be prepared 
for an increase in premiums and the level of loss which we retain through 
deductibles. I will keep you advised as these negotiations progress. 

Please forward this notice to all concerned parties within your group. If 
there are any questions, please give me a call at ext. 36263.

Subject:	Conversation with Edison re: Getting Negative CTC Paid

I talked to John Fielder (SVP Edison) about setting up a meeting for Barry Tycholiz with Edison's CFO about hedging Edison's QF price risk. Fielder wanted to talk about the negative CTC issue. Here's what he said:

They plan to "settle" with the ESPs and pay them when they pay everyone else, which he re-iterated would be sometime in Q1'02.
Edison is holding firm to the notion that the negative CTC contributed to the utility's undercollection and that the ESP's share of the undercollection has to be netted against the payables attributable to the negative CTC and owed the ESP.
He said that they will propose to net it out in one of two ways:  1) lump sum netting (i.e., if they owe $50MM and the share of the undercollection is $30 MM, then they pay the ESP $20 MM; or 2) future reductions in PX Credit (i.e., they pay the ESP $50 MM, and then reduce the PX going forward until the $30 MM is paid down).  The numbers are illustrative only.
In addition, he said that they have the view that a decision is going to have to be made about 1) whether DA customers pay for stranded costs tied to the DWR L-T contracts, and 2) whether DA customers pay going forward for stranded costs tied to the QF contracts.  (Edison is clearly lobbying the PUC to get DA customers to pay for these costs.)
I recommended strongly that he de-link issues 1 and 2 above from the issue of paying us ASAP what they owe us for negative CTC.  He agreed.
He said that the PUC judge's recently issued pre-hearing conference order requires that Edison "meet and confer" with ESPs prior to the Nov. 7th hearing, and that Edison intends to set something up with ESPs prior to that hearing.
Fielder is also the point person on "getting ESPs paid" and intends to initiate settlement discussions with ESPs week after next.
It was very clear from the conversation that Edison is going to do everything possible (at the expense of creditors) to maximize headroom under the settlement it struck with the PUC a few weeks ago.  Edison's stalemate with the QFs is evidence of it.  We shouldn't assume anything different with the Negative CTC issue.

If you have any questions, let us know.

Best,
Jeff

I talked to John Fielder (SVP Edison) about setting up a meeting for Barry Tycholiz with Edison's CFO about hedging Edison's QF price risk. Fielder wanted to talk about the negative CTC issue. Here's what he said:

They plan to "settle" with the ESPs and pay them when they pay everyone else, which he re-iterated would be sometime in Q1'02.
Edison is holding firm to the notion that the negative CTC contributed to the utility's undercollection and that the ESP's share of the undercollection has to be netted against the payables attributable to the negative CTC and owed the ESP.
He said that they will propose to net it out in one of two ways:  1) lump sum netting (i.e., if they owe $50MM and the share of the undercollection is $30 MM, then they pay the ESP $20 MM; or 2) future reductions in PX Credit (i.e., they pay the ESP $50 MM, and then reduce the PX going forward until the $30 MM is paid down).  The numbers are illustrative only.
In addition, he said that they have the view that a decision is going to have to be made about 1) whether DA customers pay for stranded costs tied to the DWR L-T contracts, and 2) whether DA customers pay going forward for stranded costs tied to the QF contracts.  (Edison is clearly lobbying the PUC to get DA customers to pay for these costs.)
I recommended strongly that he de-link issues 1 and 2 above from the issue of paying us ASAP what they owe us for negative CTC.  He agreed.
He said that the PUC judge's recently issued pre-hearing conference order requires that Edison "meet and confer" with ESPs prior to the Nov. 7th hearing, and that Edison intends to set something up with ESPs prior to that hearing.
Fielder is also the point person on "getting ESPs paid" and intends to initiate settlement discussions with ESPs week after next.
It was very clear from the conversation that Edison is going to do everything possible (at the expense of creditors) to maximize headroom under the settlement it struck with the PUC a few weeks ago.  Edison's stalemate with the QFs is evidence of it.  We shouldn't assume anything different with the Negative CTC issue.

If you have any questions, let us know.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff, can you spend a little time thinking about the current North American 
energy markets (very high energy prices, stretched infrastructure, etc) and 
determine which game changing or altering technologies, business models or 
existing corporate positions that will benefit from such price and volatility 
levels.

  In particular, I think that Miller should take a look at coal gasification 
technologies, emissions technologies and DSM/efficiency technologies and how 
these investments may fit in the charter or our overall business.  As well, 
from a corporate development point of view which parts of the value chain ie) 
IPP, E&P, utility, assets, etc are undervalued given current commodity curves 
and expectations.

Can you get back to me with a few ideas in the next week or so - maybe it 
would help to go pick a few brains in various ENA orgs as part of your 
process.

for me to have dinner - get Beverly to schedule the plane to get me in and 
out that day.  If not next week then early the following.  I think it will 
take a one on one with Lew to get this one centered.

Ameren, DPL, Cinergy, etc.

Subject: FPL Update

Dave,

As I mentioned in my voicemail last night, I spoke with Randy and Aldo.  The 
tone was positive, and they said Goldman was very bullish on the whole 
story.  All these guys acknowledge that without our Trading stamp on NewCo, 
NewCo will not be a world class Genco.  With that said, it is apparent that 
Lew is telling these guys to go back and get more EXACT detail on what 
exactly Enron is willing to do in terms of people (both Trading and Risk 
Management). I would have to believe that a conversation between you and Lew 
would go a long way in making him comfortable that we are truly committed to 
NewCo, particularly with $400-$500 million of equity tied up in this entity.  
Apparently we have to arm Lew with everything that he needs to go to 
Broadhead to argue why NewCo makes sense and why they need Enron in this 
entity.  I have tried to convince these guys that while Trading is people, it 
is also philosophy, style and approach.  Given that we have said that we 
would nominate the Head Trader, I have tried to convey that we might be 
looking to utilize a lot of FPLE T&M people, but immerse them in our 
philosophy.  They are not comfortable with this, and have informed me that 
coming back with the answer that we will only put one Enron person in Trading 
is probably not the right answer.  Given the dynamic nature of Enron and 
Trading in general,  making a huge commitment of people I would imagine will 
be tough.

We talked through many other aspects including whether they think that they 
can do an IPO without us; the fact that having our involvement clearly 
increases the value of NewCo (raises an interesting question about how we get 
adequately compensated for this);  tight labor market in general and the fact 
that we don't have unlimited human resources here at Enron; and that in the 
early years, NewCo has very little merchant generation, and that all of it is 
FPLE 's (implies fewer people needed, and that we should be able to utilize 
FPLE Traders).  We also discussed the rumor about FPL's interest in Aquilla.

Sorry to bog down your vacation with this.  If you want to talk today, I will 
be around.

Thanks,

Don

I am having trouble finding the gentleman you referred to yesterday as David 
Redman or Redmond. Did I not get his name correct or could you assist in 
where I can track him down.

Kay please forward to Max Yzaguirre.

Max, congrats on the Decero PPA - we need to wrestle up another 100 to 200 
MW.  This should be a priority given the profit potential of this deal as per 
Oz and Doug (+50M in 2000).  Is there an ability to let Sabine or Irvin run 
with Vitro and get your attention on this item asap.  I know that the 
Monterrey project is eating into your time.  Do we need to augment your 
resources?

On a different note, the current Monterrey control budget is showing a $5.3M 
negative variance from the original control budget.  Is this accurate?  Does 
this reduce the profitability or is it absorbed by the PPA's?

Regards
Delainey

Like you, I am getting very frustrated with this process.  I am genuinely trying to be as reasonable as possible.  I am not trying to "hold up" the deal at the last minute.  I'm afraid that I am being asked to take a fairly large leap of faith after this company (I don't mean the two of you -- I mean Enron) has screwed me and the people who work for me.

I am generally ok with the concept of the option, the doc, and comp parameters.  In addition, I need assurances that 90 day retentions will be paid to the people we have identified who deserve them and haven't received them and I need to know that the comp conveyed to me in 2001 is secure. 

It is unlikely that I would be here today if it weren't for the collective comp conveyed to me during 2001.  I have received assurances from the two of you, Oxley, and Greg at different times as to the security of the comp received.  The messages generally start with "it's safe," "don't worry about it," "all comp paid in 2001 advanced the interest of shareholders and the estate," "low probability that there will be any issues," ....  At other times, particularly when you want me to commit to this deal, the logic changes.  The comp paid in 2001 becomes risky and will become a whole lot safer if I'm on the team.  While I recognize that Enron is a very strange and fluid place these days, it appears that at times the story changes depending on what you want me to do.

When I ask for indemnification on comp paid to me in 2001 the answer is that it is off the table -- a non-starter.  Why?  
Because the estate is negotiating the deal.  Then have them negotiate that on behalf of me.
Because the buyer has no interest in legacy issues with the estate.  I wouldn't be here but for the legacy issues with the estate -- it is definitely the buyer's issue!
Because people have too much to do to get this deal done to take the time to negotiate with each employee.  I am available at any time wherever you want me to be to discuss this matter if and when the estate/the buyer have time.
Because we don't know who from the buyer to negotiate with.  Someone from the buyer has to decide on comp and contract issues -- why not figure it out now.
Because this deal is bigger than Tim Belden.  I'm not delusional.  I know that this is a big deal with a lot of moving parts.  If it's bigger than me then it will likely move forward without me.


Since I am not "on the team" right now, I am also working with a great deal less information than you have.  I respect your choice to differentiate the information disseminated to people "on the team" versus not "on the team."  However, the consequences of that choice provide less information to me which creates a greater leap of faith in my mind.  For example, I have no idea how the mechanics of getting these options done, conveyed to the creditors/buyer/estate/judge works.  Louise inidicated that it would be a memo or some form of written document indicating the people and total dollars needed to secure them.  If that's the case, you could add my indemnification amount (adjusted by probability of payout) to that total and it surely wouldn't blow up the deal.  Unless, the probability of payout is high.

Furthermore, I am not proposing that we change the basic employment doc (subject to comment from my lawyer, but I'll try to keep immaterial changes to a minimum).  I am saying that a condition precedent for me is to negotiate a separate indemnification doc with the buyer.  At that point in time, I would hope that they have the time and the inclination to discuss such a doc.  Perhaps at that time, some of the 2001 comp issues will already be cleared through the bankruptcy judge making the discussion that much easier.  Based on various discussions with the two of you over the last couple of weeks I have been led to believe that such a decision is expected and perhaps imminent.  I don't understand why this is a non-starter issue, but I don't have the same information that you do.

To be clear, here is the basic deal that I am willing to offer as a free option to the buyer:
the deal as it exists plus
retention payments for those still with the company who deserve them who have not yet received them.
indemnification of 2001 comp up to $4 million.

I expect that the two of you will tell me that I'm not on the team, that 800 people are going home, and that the Portland office will be moved to Houston if this thing survives.  That is not what I want to happen.  If this deal is bigger than me then those things shouldn't happen.  I have given this a lot of thought over the last couple of days and came up with my conclusions.  I am open to any productive discussions that you would like to have.

In talking through this stuff with Mike and Matt I realize what a hard position you guys are in.  I feel that I have lost ground rather than gain ground with them in the last couple of days.  I trust that you are trying to do the right thing.  There are just so many things that are uncertain right now that it makes it very difficult for me to give away the option that you have requested without firming up some other issues for me at the same time.  

Finally, I apologize for hanging up on Louise ealier.  It's probably better than me hearing what she was about to say and her hearing what I was about to say.  I will call to see that you received and read this e-mail.  I am comfortable with whatever you decide to do.

Tim

Guys, good job with the California issues - we didn't get everything but we 
managed the position in a very effective manner.

Jim, given our view to support the growth of the ISO structures as a 
necessary evil and given the socio-political leaning of these entities, 
should we be more actively or aggressively supporting or nominating directors 
on these boards?

Jim/Rick, we need a full court press on this NEPool ICAP issue - Allegretti

all commercial and non-commercial direct reports.  I would suggest that we 
follow up with a master list for each business unit to ensure that all 
reviews are completed across ENA much like the process we undertook at 
mid-year.  I would shoot for 100% participation target.  How are we making 
out on the NIM/Issues folks in ENA - either out the door or completed plans?

Dave and Dave,

Wayne Mays and I are trying to assess technical support requirements for the 
next 12-24 months.  We would like to talk with each of you to get you input 
on the direction the company is going, and what type and level of support is 
likely to be required as we go forward.

If possible, we'd like to schedule a brief (30 minute) conference call, 
preferably within the next week, with each of you to discuss these issues.  
If you have a time that would be convenient, please let me and/or Wayne know 
so that we can get it scheduled.

Thanks!

Folks,
Attached is a list of 37 executives, not yet enrolled on the "exective impact 
and influence" programme administered by Dick Amabile.
The OTC clearly set the goal at the beginning of the year, and repeated again 
at Mid year, that all VPs and MDs need to have attended this programme by end 
of year 2000. Their attendance does form part of the discussions on the VPs 
and MDs at the executive PRC.

Despite repeated comms from the OTC, these 37 names have not yet enrolled (or 
cancelled off a programme and have not re-enrolled). 

HR has committed to making sure that these people are enrolled, so the 
suggestion is that the named HR rep in the attachment takes 5 minutes to meet 
with the individuals, explain that they need to do this, show them the list 
of dates, and get them to choose which programme they want to enrol on. 
Please do not leave that meeting without a date! A word of caution, it is 
remotely possible that some of these individuals may have enrolled in the 
very recent past, or have attended and this data not yet reached Dick's 
spreadsheet, so do double check that they haven't yet enrolled before 
twisting their arms..

The dates for the remaining programmes are also on the spreadsheet.

To enrol a VP or MD,  get their dates, give it to their assistants and tell 
them to directly contact Debbie Nowak on 33304.

Tim

Dave,

CSFB spoke with DPL today.  Pete Forster (chairman) said he wants to meet 
with you to discuss peakers and other opportunities on the trading and 
marketing side.  Besides 3200 MWs of Ohio regulated assets, DPL has a peaking 
strategy in ECAR and today has 400-500 MWs in development (interesting to 
have peaking strategy with no T&M).  They would like to look at our peakers 
to supplement strategy.  Forster didn't flinch when they said $400 kW is the 
ballpark number.  More interestingly, Forster went into his desire to talk 
with you about other ideas relating to T&M.  

Forster suggested 27th or 28th of July for the meeting.  You are more open on 
the 28th.  It appears Forster may be open to coming down here.  He wants CSFB 
and us to co-ordinate meeting schedule.  CSFB is DPL's main advisor, and the 
guys that negotiated the KKR deal a while back.

Apparently we are talking with these guys on the gas side.

Regards,

Don

David,

  I need more information on the project and who exactly the individuals are 
who you feel should participate in this program.  Generally, developers and 
deal people throughout the company are not provided with additional incentive 
since this type of work is part of their job.  However, this project may be 
an exception.  Please call and lets discuss.

Thanks!

Subject: ENA Comp suggestions for Project Raptor

I have been discussing with Dave Delainey how we might align the 
compensation/rewards for the group of 4 or 5 VP's and Directors we have 
assigned to disposing of our large portfolio ($650mm). The project is due to 
complete in June 01 and Dave and my concern is whether we can make sure they 
are motivated to close on time and get the best possible price for us. Dave 
believe the up side could be as much as $150mm and the downside as much as 
$300mm (the difference between best and worst prices/sales).

My suggestion is that we do the following and I would like your comments or 
concerns if any:

Enter into contracts or an agreement (the later would be one way - us to them 
and obviously easier) with each of them outlining the following:

Bonus targets based on financial targets and PRC performance for calendar 01 
(ie if you rank in top 3 categories and you realise over $650 from this 
project we will pay you not less than $300k)

Equity award on closing, on the basis of successful closure and above line 
value (ie only in the event that this closes in June 01 and realises more 
than $650mm we will grant you $200k in options, if above $800m then $350k in 
options.)

Dave would like for me to get back to him on this asap.

David

David,  

I hope all is well.  I had another good week at pulp and paper.  As you know 
I have an affinity for technology trading.  I thought you would enjoy the 
fine words below as you start a new week.  

Time is your most precious possession-and the hands of time move swiftly 
onward.  Fasten this warning deep into your mind, not for sorrow,s sake, but 
to remind yourself that today may be all you have.  Now is the time for you 
to move forward. Now is the time for you to stand and be counted.  The ground 
is now ready for you to plant the seeds of a new vision, one that will bear 
only the finest fruit.  It is time to focus on what you want, to turn dreams 
into realities so that you are able to spend your life in the manner in which 
you desire.  It is later than you think.    Too many of us waste our years 
waiting for better times in the future or reflecting upon better times in the 
past, instead of working for better times in the present.  --------------- If 
only we had better schooling, better opportunities, or better resources. 
If,if,if!  Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow!  
-------------------------------------

Today is always here; yesterday is gone; and tomorrow never comes.  Time 
offers opportunity but demands a sense of urgency.  Now is the time.  This is 
the place.  You are the one!

Those who leave a legacy of achievement master the art of living in the now- 
the ability to make each moment count.  Here are their tips.

? First, they accept each moment as a gift to be received with joy.
? Second, they use each moment to maximum advantage.
? Third, they are bent on making a contribution to humanity.
? Fourth, they learn from their mistakes.
? Fifth, they concentrate on the task at hand.
? Sixth, they plan for the future rather than fretting over the past.
? Seventh, they simply refuse to allow the weight of an unpleasant 
circumstance to encumber their thoughts or objectives.

                                                                              
               Dennis P. Kimbroa

I think technology is made up of a number of tradable commodities.  These 
commodities are volatile and trading them will add value to ENA.  I would 
like the opportunity to create this group.

Best wishes,

M. A. Moulton

Subject: Goldendale Turbine

Dave,

In going through the turbine list over the last few days, EE&CC's, Sumas II- 
Goldendale (GE 7FA, Jun '01 delivery) turbine keeps popping up.  ENA could 
trade this turbine to several parties (Tenaska, Indeck) to get a lock on a QF 
restructuring.  Also, Sumas I still has restructruring value that EE&CC did 
not get a lock on in exchange for the EPC/turbine contract. 

As I recall, Larry Izzo promised to replace the GE 7FA turbine with a 
comparable machine with a Q4-2001 delivery date.  While the Goldendale EPC 
contract may executed and there may be nothing to do, there is significant 
value sitting on the table.  If we cannot get the Goldendale 7FA back, then 
can we enforce the replacement provision that was promised (as I remember) as 
part of your original deal with Larry Izzo?  I realize that at this point the 
politics may prevent us from doing anything.  However, I at least want to get 
you thinking about it just in case there was a way to get a turbine to trade 
for larger value than an EPC contract for EE&CC.

Regards,

Dave,

I understand that you are also a former UWO grad (please correct me if this 
is incorrect).

Are you involved in the decisions to recruit or provide sponsorship at Ivey?

The reason I ask is that the LEADER Project at Ivey is in need of a new lead 
sponsor and given the new developments in Ontario and Alberta with dereg, 
this may be a great opportunity to get Enron's name out in the business 
community.

I was very involved with the LEADER Project when I was at Ivey as one of the 
Executive Directors and oversaw general operations as well as the Western 
Region (i.e. Ukraine and Belarus).  While Enron may not have specific 
interests to promote in Ukraine, Russia, Belarus, or Kazakstan, LEADER is a 
very large and well respected project within the school and amongst the 
alumni.   I have already made a $250 personal donation to the project and 
would love to see a greater presence of Enron (Houston) on campus.

I know that this is a busy time of year but perhaps you can consider the idea 
and we can discuss its potential in the new year.

Thanks in advance,

Guys, I have explained the strategy/tactics that have lead to this position 
in some detail.  In my opinion the company is not at risk and potentially ENA 
could create significant value from a project that we have very little 
invested.  I understand the construction risk on the bid as much as anyone 
and we have no intention of lifting their offer. As far as EECC involvement, 
as I had mentioned, Coleman was a part of all these discussions.  I will 
argue that Mike and the ENA deal team made the right call necessary to 
maximize return in the short run for Enron without investing significant 
dollars or taking significant risks.

Obviously, I was unsuccessful in explaining such a sophisticated strategy.

Thanks for the note Mat.  Look fwd to supporting your effort as needed!   

Just to insure that ENA and RAC aren't duplicating efforts...., we have been 
told by Rick Buy that he wanted RAC to keep the Enron Turbine "book" (with 
input from other business units), and have just concluded multiple sessions 
w/ RAC to xfer that function to them (I think we invited your team to those 
sessions).  Rick Carson/RAC is working on a format that can be used by 
multiple parties, including board presentations.  The idea was that different 
business units (ENA,, EECC, etc) could provide input, and....., RAC's 
involvement would enhance the list.   

If ENA is going to keep "the turbine book" - maybe RAC doesn't need to (none 
of our business, but...., doesn't seem like RAC needs to be doing the same 
thing you are doing).    

Who from ENA could discuss this w/ Dave Gorte (Rick's on vacation)?  

Also - do you have a rep that can attend the bi-weekly turbine lunches where 
we go through the list - coordinating turbine efforts across all business 
units?  

Thanks - F.Kelly

Subject: Moore Power Plant

Dave,
Re schedule:
1.  We are proceeding with the kick-off of the permit amendment, and will be 
using a combination of both the MCN and Calumet N2 unit data.  Per my phone 
message, it will take about a week or two to prepare the amendment at a cost 
up to $10,000 US, and then eight weeks to get the amendment.  We should be 
able to commence site work without the amendment, to the point of completing 
foundations, based on previous discussions with the Municipality, County and 
Ontario Ministry of Envir..
Even though this work is not in our $35 MM US original DASH budget, we are 
planning to proceed with this unless you've got a problem with it.
2.  NEPCO have preliminarily re-worked the schedule now on the N1 
disassembly, move and install, and the N2 installation.  They believe they 
need to get on site by the third week in June to begin site clearing in order 
to initiate foundation work by mid July.  Between June 15 and July 15 they 
would do the foundation design - this should be on the generous side given 
that we had done some foundation design last fall, and with MCN at least have 
some of the N2 foundation work already done by ABB.
Whether it's June 21 or 30 to start the site clearing, the schedule is 
getting tight.

Re capital cost estimate:
3.  NEPCO is able to complete the revised capital cost estimate on the N1/N2 
case by June 9th at the latest (they're looking at moving it up to the 5th or 
6th if they work the weekend).  They have a problem at the moment as they are 
moving offices over this weekend and will lose about 4 days.  They will have 
a revised estimate on the N1 case by the end of next week - it looks today 
like the cost savings for no acceleration and winter work and being able to 
barge the units versus railing them, will all be worth at least $2 MM US. 
I'm assuming we would take the capital costs estimate into our DASH as soon 
as the estimate is ready and go for approval, so that we can meet schedule - 
I'm not sure where you stand on the "roll-up" approval on Moore, Pastoria and 
Las Vegas if the latter two don't go into Genco.
Meanwhile, progress through RAC on the DASH continues.

Re N2 units:
4.  We continue to sort out whether the Calumet units might work from a noise 
and water perspective.  We still haven't seen the MCN/Columbus counter on the 
other units but they claim it's coming.

increased risk and the cost of capital uncompetitiveness.

My idea would be to confirm that appropriate due diligence has been done. Has 
the mid-year performance evaluation been reviewed? Has his two direct 
supervisors been contacted (Ozzie Pagan and Gil Muhl) for specific input into 
this? Once all this has been confirmed and everyone has agreed, you should 
make a decision to either re-deploy him to another area or offer him a 
severence package. 

My recommendation would be to have him in a coverage role in Southeast gas.

Kay, I do not approve of the limo charge for Laura Luce's housekeeper. Laura 
needs to either write her own personal check for this or deduct the charge 
against her next expense report. It is imperative that this does not slip 
through the cracks. Since Laura no longer reports to me, Dave should handle. 
Thanks for being so diligent in looking into this.

Eric, as per our discussion, I would suggest that we have no quotes or 
comments in the press release.  As a sale of assets, which we do actively, in 
a our network strategy there is really nothing positive that can be said 
without reflecting poorly on the buyer.  I would suggest that we approve an 
AEP press release as we did with Allegheny.  If we have not already, I would 
not send the attached press release to AEP without cutting out the quote.

Utilities Secretly Lobbied Congress; Electric Firms Gave Millions to
Left and Right to Halt Deregulation
John Mintz

05/11/2000
The Washington Post
FINAL
A01
Copyright 2000, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved

  Some of the nation's largest electric utilities have secretly
funneled millions of dollars through two front groups--one headed by
well-known conservative leaders to appeal to Republicans, the other
affiliated with unions--to stop Congress from deregulating their
industry.

  The campaign, which at times was run out of the offices of the
utilities' CEOs, was so secret that some Washington lobbyists for
these same companies were kept in the dark about many of its
activities, according to documents stamped "confidential" by the
effort's organizers.
  The documents offer an inside view of the industry's
clandestine efforts to wage its political battle through newly minted
entities with innocuous-sounding names. While the use of such groups
has become a common device in lobbying campaigns, it is rare to obtain
a detailed operator's manual for such an effort, complete with candid
assessments of individual lawmakers' vulnerabilities and specific
budgets for waging grass-roots campaigns in their districts.

  Although the two groups--the conservative Citizens for State
Power and the liberal Electric Utility Shareholders Alliance--have
advertised heavily against deregulation, until now only those involved
in the effort knew the organizations were the creation of the same
network of utilities. This network believed using seemingly
independent surrogates made their case more believable and shielded
them from political risk.

  A 1998 memo said the utilities ran the groups in an
arm's-length way described as "discreet, guarded and highly
confidential. . . . Fear of congressional reprisals conditioned this
style. . . . It would be prudent to avoid rash openness."

  Their ongoing "grass roots" lobbying campaign was designed to
influence members of Congress by whipping up hometown ferment with
radio ads directing listeners to call "1-800-BAD-BILL" and telephone
banks wired to connect angry home district residents to congressional
offices.

  The goal of the operation, on which the utilities spent $17
million over the last 3 1/2 years, was to bottle up legislation in a
single congressional panel, the House Commerce Committee's energy and
power subcommittee.

  The utilities' stealth campaign is one reason energy
deregulation legislation has been stalled, although last fall one
partial deregulation bill was reported to the full committee. Commerce
Chairman Thomas J. Bliley Jr. (R-Va.) is a staunch industry critic
determined to move a bill.

  The documents describe meetings in Washington steak houses such
as Sam & Harry's where utility lobbyists and consultants shaped
strategies for stopping Bliley. The dozen or so participants in the
operation--who called their effort "The Project"--address each other
in the memos with the kind of blunt talk that isn't often found in
civics textbooks.

  "The trendline is ominous in that a spirit of accommodation and
compromise is definitely taking hold," said one document in 1998, when
the utilities feared Bliley was winning over committee colleagues.
"The number one goal of 'The Project' has always been to bottleneck
legislation."

  The participants speak of the need to "demonize" the federal
agency that regulates utilities and to use debates about nuclear power
as "a highly provocative wedge issue" to destabilize legislative
adversaries.

  The memos were given to The Washington Post by deregulation
advocates, and participants in "The Project" confirmed their
authenticity.

  The effort has outraged some congressional advocates of power
deregulation. Rep. Steve Largent (R-Okla.)--whom the conservative
front group, Citizens for State Power, attacked in home district radio
ads last year--said it is "bogus" for a group to claim the
conservative mantle by protecting big utilities.

  "They're wearing a conservative hat, but they ought to be
wearing a profit-making hat," said Largent. "The best interest of
conservatives is to create competition."

  Citizens for State Power (CSP) is headed by two leading lights
of the conservative movement--anti-tax and Republican activist Grover
Norquist, and David Keene, chairman of the American Conservative
Union--and is run day-to-day by a veteran GOP operative, Craig
Shirley. It denied for years that it took industry funds, but in
recent years acknowledged taking some such money while offering no
details.

  The Electric Utility Shareholders Alliance (EUSA) also was
created by utility funds, with the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers kicking in small sums. It acknowledged some of its
utility backers a few years ago but uses populist language to argue
that federal deregulation would cause layoffs and hurt mom-and-pop
utility shareholders.

  The documents detail how the Washington political consultants
who run "The Project" call into action one or another of these two
groups depending on circumstances. They used the right-leaning CSP to
broadcast ads criticizing Largent in his conservative Tulsa district
and employed the more liberal EUSA to air commercials against Rep.
Rick White (R-Wash.), who a year later lost his seat representing a
more moderate Seattle district.

  In its effort to stymie federal deregulation, "The Project" at
times argued both sides of an issue before different audiences. Its
participants told environmentally minded legislators that various
deregulation bills weren't aggressive enough in reducing utility
pollution but dispatched others to argue to pro-business members that
Congress should not threaten deep emissions cuts.

  While energy deregulation is an arcane concept to the public,
it is an extraordinarily high-stakes struggle for the nation's $300
billion-a-year power industry. The battle pits investor-owned
utilities against large manufacturers that want cheap power and
independent power companies, such as Enron Corp., that want to compete
with utilities. For one House Commerce subcommittee markup last year,
lobbying firms paid temp workers to wait in line outside the hearing
room for two days so the firms would have seats at the markup.

  Most investor-owned utilities don't want the federal government
to deregulate their businesses and introduce competition. These
utilities say that if need be, they prefer that state legislatures and
state utilities commissions do the job because they are less
heavy-handed than federal officials. So far 26 states have taken the
step.

  Deregulation advocates say that the state efforts result in a
confusing regulatory checkerboard and that federal action would lower
energy prices and encourage investment in clean energy sources.

  Many top GOP leaders were eager to deregulate utilities when
they took over Congress in 1995, seeing it as a test of a bedrock
conservative principle: opening the marketplace to competition.

  Within months, a group of utilities sprang into action,
organized by a law firm with a thriving utility practice. The firm,
which now goes by the name Ryan, Phillips, Utrecht & MacKinnon,
enlisted several existing clients and, later, numerous other firms.

  Soon, the firm had brought in nine utilities that paid from
$300,000 to $700,000 a year to fund "The Project" during the years
they participated. The main corporate participants, the documents
said, were Carolina Power & Light, Florida Power & Light, Texas
Utilities, Illinois-based Commonwealth Edison, Reliant Energy
(formerly called Houston Industries), Ohio-based First Energy,
Michigan-based Consumers Energy, Florida-based TECO and Union Electric
Co. in Missouri.

  "The Project" was run by law firm partner Jeffrey MacKinnon, a
former top aide to Rep. Joe Barton (R-Tex.), chairman of the House
subcommittee; and Tim Ridley, a former Democratic staff member in
Congress who now runs a firm specializing in "grass roots" lobbying
campaigns.

  They and the utilities ran the two front groups and supervised
more than 50 "mobilizations" in congressional districts, in which
radio aids were aired. Banks of trained telephone operators arranged
for home district residents to send telegrams or place calls to
congressional offices. The groups also arranged for influential
citizens in the members' home towns to spread their message--including
the car dealers who sold members their cars.

  While most of the ads were not particularly negative, others
used sarcasm or debatable statistics to attack their targets.

  The one broadcast against Largent said he was favoring "Boston,
bureaucrats and biomass" because the House member had joined with Rep.
Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) on a measure that industry officials said
could have required utilities to use alternative energy sources. A
memo from late 1998, six months before the campaign, gave a taste of
the utilities' displeasure with him, describing the firms as "highly
alarmed by Largent's obtuseness" and noting they "could make Largent's
life very uncomfortable."  Some congressional Republicans hold Citizens
for State Power
partially responsible for defeating White, who lost his swing seat to
a Democrat, Jay Inslee. A year before the November 1998 election, the
group aired an ad saying White wanted to raise utility rates by 35
percent, and it also circulated a poll and memo among political
professionals showing that White would be beaten easily, in part
because of his embrace of deregulation.

  "For the first time in this debate there were palpable
political consequences for appearing to support" deregulation, a June
1998 document said. "In the case of Rick White, those consequences
were direct and career threatening."

  White said he doubted the ads played much role in his defeat,
but he recalls his unease at realizing a GOP group was targeting him.

  "I was a loyal member of the Republican cause, and this was a
case of shooting a friend in the foot," he said.

Can you let me know who you forwarded the information on the MHI turbines 
to?  Mitsubishi has received some information inquiries directly from other 
Enron areas about utilizing the machines in North America.  If MHI learns 
that we are considering moving the machines at this point, this will create 
siginificant problems in closing the year end re-financing.  I need to 
forward a message to those considering the machines to work through me.

Thanks,

Subject: Ada pump and QF concerns in general

I wasn't sure whether you were messing with me or serious during the QBR 
about the Ada boiler pump.  It was a $10k issue which was fixed in the normal 
course of operations and NBD in the scope of things.  The QF was never at 
risk as the pump is a standard part which is commonly available.

The QF loss issue I typically worry about usually derive from an outage 
sourced at the counterparty level (cashflow problems, operational 
difficulties, etc.)  I've seen this cause a few projects tense moments, 
although FERC has always allowed the projects to recover.  Typically the 
utility will protest the loss of QF but since the QF's are self-certifying 
with FERC right to protest, the utility can typically only make noise and or 
cease paying.  

Recently, FPL attempted to not let the Indiantown QF IPP back on-line after a 
technical shutdown (and thereby bust their QF), but FPL lost their case in 
court (wrongful act) and has had to let the project return to on-line status 
(financing and QF remained intact over the +6 month ordeal).

To me the general theme is that an executed and performing (energy is being 
delivered) PPA will survive incredible QF stress.  The plant managers 
typically have the highest level of understanding of the intricacies of the 
PPA's vis-a-vis the relationship between plant, utility and QF host.  
Historically, FERC is not looking to kick out a project's contract based upon 
a QF technicality, although charged with enforcement of QF.  If FERC was a 
tough enforcer, Cleburne and a few other similar QF projects would rate high 
on their hit list and the past speaks well to the future in this case.

Chuck

To: David W Delainey/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jeff Donahue/HOU/ECT@ECT

Subject: FPL Update

We spent three days meeting with the FPL guys last week.  The meetings were 
productive, and we are making progress.  Lew has instructed these guys to get 
down into a lot of detail on the business plan/core competencies, which we 
did!

They also floated the valuation of their existing assets - $3.1B for 3947 MWs 
or $789/kW.  We walked them through our peaker valuation as well.  We didn't 
debate the valuations, but rather we decided to go ahead and have Clement and 
Jinsung try to pull together a consolidated model for NewCo.  That is being 
done, and should be ready Monday/Tuesday. 

It is apparent from these meetings that they are looking for ENRON to provide 
several key pieces to NewCo (other than peakers and dev. projects):

1. Enron culture and emphasis on intellectual capital (including HR approach).
2. Trading and marketing expertise.
3. Enron style finance.
4. Select management spots.
5. Supplement development team.

The interesting debate is how we get compensated for the significant impact 
that the Enron "halo" is going to have on NewCo's IPO ( particularly if we 
deliver the items listed above).  I raised this incremental value issue with 
them.

FPL's key pieces include:

1. Core "operating" competencies and asset management techniques.
2. Construction management techniques.
3.  Select management spots.
4.  National development team.

The FPL risk in this whole exercise is if Lew is unsuccessful in convincing 
Broadhead that owning some % of NewCo is not a better value proposition that 
owning 100% on FPLE; and/or the decision to wait until Florida deregulates 
before spinning out FPLE.  Glenn Smith stopped by last week and he 
highlighted these issues as well.

We have a lot of work to do this week including a need to determine Trading & 
Marketing model; develop potential services agreements (QF, back office); 
refine our financial model and expand to include new projects, turbine capx, 
etc.; expand development framework;  pull pitch together to float NewCo by 
investment bank, etc.....

I am happy to expand on exactly where we stand with FPL.  I guess we also 
need to think about staffing if both Cinergy and FPL move forward (let's just 
sell the peakers to Cinergy for $1.25B and let them do their own IPO).

Regards,

Don

As a follow up to our conversations on the origination function within ENA, I 
was hoping that you could join us at our middle marketing team meeting on 
September 21 at 4:00 pm. I think it would be beneficial if you shared your 
views on origination currently and its role (s) in the future. This would 
also be an excellent forum for you to discuss ENA's short and long- term 
goals.

If this date is not amenable to you, please let me know when you would be 
available.

Subject: Ontario NUG Contract Management

Dave/John, we have been awarded the RFP to assume the role of contract 
manager for the Ontario NUG's (some 1700 MW's) for a 3 year term. A 
definitive agmt will  be executed by the end of November. This was a 
high-profile RFP and I think that it confirms our investment in positioning 
ourselves in Ontario.

This was truly a team effort (east/west orig, east trading, legal, 
regulatory) in responding to the RFP with a ton of long days needed in a 
short time-frame. The response to RFP was structured to manage all risks and 
well thought out which ultimately led to our successful bid.

I attach an executive summary that gives further details. If you have any 
questions, please call myself, Paul or Eric.

Guys, Joe Sutton had passed down an opportunity that probably fits your 
capabilities better than ours.  

In a nutshell, a consultant on retainer by Mass. General Hospital in Boston, 
part of the Healthcare Partners system, is desiring a steam and electric 
contract.  The steam load could be as high as 500,000 pd of steam and 22 MW 
of power.  I think they are very open to an energy partner to manage all 
their needs perhaps including the six or seven other hospitals that HP 
controls in the nation.

The consultants name is Joe Petrowski (203)451-9747.  I spoke to him 
yesterday afternoon and promised that one of you would be in contact.  Joe is 
a big fan of Enron's and could see the logic of a more robust product like 
the full energy outsourcing versus just a steam agreement.  It may be a good 
lead into the health care segment.

Delainey

Guys, I have explained the strategy/tactics that have lead to this position 
in some detail.  In my opinion the company is not at risk and potentially ENA 
could create significant value from a project that we have very little 
invested.  I understand the construction risk on the bid as much as anyone 
and we have no intention of lifting their offer. As far as EECC involvement, 
as I had mentioned, Coleman was a part of all these discussions.  I will 
argue that Mike and the ENA deal team made the right call necessary to 
maximize return in the short run for Enron without investing significant 
dollars or taking significant risks.

Obviously, I was unsuccessful in explaining such a sophisticated strategy.

Fran was the one asking me to go to the ENA Final VP PRC on the 7th since I 
had a few months of data on Rodney, Edward, Ajello and Burnett.  Also, Rodney 
and Edward were hoping I could attend ( I guess they think my attendance 
would help them not hurt them!).  I can attend if you want and give my Q1 
observations.  However, if you think you have it handled, that is OK for me 
as well.  I am not emotional about it either way and am only concerned about 
helping if you need it or want it.  That is why Kay asked you about it today.

Let me know your thoughts.

Thanks.

Dave, I am seeking your approval to take my group on an offsite to Las Vegas 
sometime in late 3rd/early 4th quarter. Cost is approx Cdn $1000/person for 
flight and accomodation (thursday - sunday). As you know, we have done this 
for a number of years but I'm not sure what approvals were obtained in the 
past as it was either your group or Lavorato's group at the time. This would 
involve Origination only as Trading is doing an offsite in conjunction with 
the rest of Shankman's group. It should be noted also that we decided not to 
attend the Masters this year as we didnt think it generated enough business 
following last years trip -  this cut our expenses substantially. Please let 
me know your thoughts on this.

It was just brought to my attention by Dave Steiner that the Estate will continue to own the F(urniture), F(ixtures), and E(quipment) and that UBS will be able to use it for free so long as we are in this building.

As you both know, it is possible that we will move from this floor and would like to take a good portion of the FFE with us.  My understanding is that Enron is leasing the furniture in Houston and owns the furniture in Portland.  Therefore, it makes sense for the Houston office to continue to use the furniture but not move it.  It doesn't make as much sense here as it will be expensive for the Estate to dispose of the furniture here and it will be even more expensive to move it to sell it.

Here's the issue -- the Estate should convey the furniture in Portland to UBS.  Is this possible?  What do we need to do to make this happen?

i heard dave's voicemail.  i appreciate his concern.  however, i don't think that the delineation is easy to do.  i am confident that my team knows what we are good at and what we aren't good at.  if we aren't best suited to serve the load, we will act like "one enron" and send the account over to the them.  the split should really be driven by the customer's needs and which utility they are behind.  for example, montana power has a wonderful balancing tariff where the utility looks at the scheduled volume and compares it to the actual volumes and settles directly with the customer for imbalances.  we don't do any metering, we don't do any unique billing, the loads range anywhere from 1 MW to 25 MW.  ena is definitely best suited to serve these industrials because commodity price is their top interest.  the pugest system is about to open up with a structure that is similar to montana's.  ena will be very well positioned to serve this load.  the same company could have a plant in california.  we wouldn't serve that load because the expertise needed to manage the ctc risk (before this thing blew up anyway), the challenge of metering and tracking metered volumes on a schedule vs. actual basis, and the load forecasting.  the same company could also own gas stations in the west.  we have no interest in serving gas stations.

i also heard the message attached to dave's from scott dann (sp?).  his message did little to open communication between groups.  he provided no details on what the issue was in the west with respect to epmi (ena) and ees.  for us to do this right, ees and ena need to be able to solve problems without involving the office of the chair of each company.  i would be happy to work with anyone from ees to resolve who should be covering which accounts.

i still can't think of a clean way to divide customers.  each approach has its problems.  each company (ees and ena) has its strengths.  our strength is commodity pricing and delivering a mw to anywhere on the western grid.  their strength is in tariff analysis, energy management, and aggregating loads.

for the west, i am confident that chris calger and i can sort out any disputes with ees that are reasonable.  we know what we are good at.  we have a proven track record with a large number of industrials in the west.  i still believe that our customers and shareholders are best served with our favored approach.  it will require better communication on the operating level between ees and ena.

Unit 1 tripped today while running.  There is some kind of foreign object 
loose in the unit.  It is unclear if the foreign object is in the compressor 
section of the hot gas path section.  We will not know the cause or extent of 
damage until the unit is boroscoped tomorrow.  

Units 2 & 3:  Will be back in commercial operation tomorrow.  The team is 
currently working on solutions to the demister.  No solution yet, but Unit 3 
will return to commercial operation tomorrow.

Unit 4:  Emissions tuning continues.  The latest numbers are NOx 6 ppm, CO 50 
ppm.

Unit 5:  To fire tomorrow and begin tuning.

The e-mail that was sent out many weeks ago about the off-site indicated that it would run from Wednesday night to Saturday AM.  It is now running Thursday until Sunday.  Calger has found a leased plane that costs roughly $13k for one roundtrip and a total of $20k for two round trips.  I had already made arraingements to attend a wedding in Oregon on Saturday night.  It is a good friend of mine and my wife's.  It's in eastern Oregon and is about a four hour drive away.  I see the following choices before me:

1.	Don't go to Colorado.  Tell you guys that I'm a family man and not a company man.
2.	Go to Colorado and fly home commercial on Friday night, leaving at about 4 PM.  Incremental cost of flight would be $500.
3.	Go to Colorado and fly home on the rented plane on early Saturday afternoon.  Incremental cost of flight would be $7,000.
4.	Don't go to wedding.  Tell my wife that I'm a company man and that it is critical that I ride mountain bikes with a bunch of 30-something Enron folks all weekend.

While I have authority to place millions of dollars of the company's money at risk, I don't feel comfortable signing up for a $7,000 extra flight without talking to you guys.  #3, the jet set answer costs quite a bit more, but it dramatically increases the amount of time that I spend in Colorado.  #2 is cost-effective but gives me less than 24 hours in Colorado.  #4, while perhaps appealing to you, doesn't work for me.  #2 is probably preferable to #1, just requires a lot of travel time to me.

Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.

This morning Enron's credit rating was downgraded to junk status which is below investment grade.  This is very bad news for Enron's future prospects. 

The flurry of activity that you see from the trading and scheduling team is a direct result of our credit downgrade.  Many of our contracts have provisions that allow our customers to stop performing on their contracts with us if Enron's credit rating falls below investment grade and if we are unable to post sufficient collateral.  The trading, scheduling, and legal team are working together to figure out how to meet our physical delivery obligations over the next several weeks.  This is our number one priority right now.

 I will still be holding the floor meeting at 1 PM today.  I would like to hold the meeting earlier but am not sure that I will be able to do so.  I know that people are very concerned about our ever-worsening status.  I know that you want information as soon as possible.  If I am able to meet before 1 PM I will send out an e-mail announcing an earlier meeting.

Dave,

You asked about office costs, depreciation and headcount:

Office Costs are correct and include rent, supplies, backoffice expenses, 
general marketing and charitable contributions.

Depreciation includes leashold improvements (walls, carpet and paint) and 
certain computers/IT not covered in the IT allocation (Tim is checking on the 
$278K)

Headcount is close: my actual 2000 headcount is 38, not 36 and Tim's plan for 
2001 may be overstated by one or two; overall headcount increase is probably 
15, not 18.

Hope this clarifies the plan.

Regards,

Chris

Subject:	West VAR

the numbers being generated for the west's var do not comport with what i believe our risk to be.  i think that it may have to do with the correlation across months and across locations.  for example, the ltnw book has a grant total of <3,000> MWh from now through September On-Peak and 194,000 MWh from now through September Off-Peak.  the var report shows mike with $20 million of var -- about $16 million of it coming between now and september.  we have a total var of $30 million, with about $20 million between now and september.  by my rough calculations, we would have to have the entire curve move roughly $100/MWh in one day for this var to be accurate.  that means that once every 20 days the entire summer curve -- peak and off-peak -- would have to move in excess of $100/MWh.  i might add that we are short q4 which i'm not giving us any credit for as an offset. 

i understand that there is a lot of risk on our books.  i just don't think that it is as much as the var model is spitting out.  wierd things happen in the var model and option valuation models due to the interaction of the blending formula on the volatility and the correlations as we approach delivery.  we see the same thing with option valuations.  we see option model valuations (e.g., transmission spread options) going through the roof when they are trading for fractions of our model valuations in reality.  similarly, the var model valuations move up really fast as the summer approaches.

bottom line.  i need to know what you want us to do.  we are chewing up a lot of var.  if we are going to get stopped out i need to know now.  i think that it would be a shame to close out of a largely spread position that wouldn't necessarily have any practical impact on our real profitability but would make the "model" happy.

Units 2, 3, and 4 are operating.  Work continues on the demisters, bearing # 
2 temp., and punch list.

Unit 5 will fire again on Saturday.  GE is installing new liners in order to 
manage emissions from the unit..  If all goes well, the performance test is 
to occur Mon - Wed next week.

Unit 1:  the repair plan is complete, but has not been written.  We will 
trade our rotor (upgraded to E specs) for Occidental's rotor.  Occidental's 
rotor is on the way to GE's Houston shop in order to grind its blades to fit 
our unit.  A new stub shaft is needed and has been acquired.  We will acquire 
Reliant's stationary blades in exchange for new replacement blades.  Total 
cost estimate is $3.0 MM.  The unit will be complete on or near July 20.

I am happy to annouce that we have completed the two new applications which will help scheduling group
with routing and path confirmation. Currently, it is in user STAGE for you to look at ( NOT FOR TESTING ) since
there are few minor issues that need to be resolved with terminal server folks and developers.

New applications are Pre-Schedule Workspace & Path Confirmation which are available under
Enpower Launch Pad -> Tools -> Pre-Schedule Workspace
Enpower Launch Pad -> Tools -> Path Confirmation

Note that new application will not work under terminal server since it requires a special MS office file
to be installed on TS.

Thanks to all enpower developers for their continued hard work, especially Will Smith's significant contribution
to this project

I am glad to discuss with both you offline for any issues / comments / concerns

Subject:	Retail Power Structuring - Confidential

Kevin & Tim:

Last week I spoke to Janet about the probable departure of Sean Holmes from EES Deal Management to EES Europe.  Janet discussed several alternatives for Deal Management and asked for my suggestions.  My suggestion is as follows:

Berney Aucoin would assume oversight of all Retail Power Structurning and Deal Management activities.  Initially, keep Deal Management separate under Deb Merrill's direction and Structuring under Edith's direction.  DSM, LC, DG would probably need to fall under Berney as well.  I would anticipate that the functional separation that currently exists between Deal Managment and Structuring would begin to go away over the next 3 - 6 months as we intersperse our more experienced people and everyone in general gets up the curve.  Thus, I would expect that we could merge Deal Managemnt and Strcuturing into one group in the near future.

I spoke to Berney and he thinks this makes sense and is up for the job.  Edith is still planning to move into a commercial Origination role at year end but I believe we could have a replacement by then.

Janet and the EES group have definitely bought into this idea - I think they would like to implement.  Janet would expect dual reporting of the Group (to EES and EWS) and I indicated that, if implemented, I did not see a problem and as far as I was concerned nothing would change - Berney reiterated this directly.

I apoloigize if you are reading this feeling as though I have taken the liberty to suggest material changes without getting full buy-in, but 1) things aren't done and 2) I wanted to suggest something that I felt made sense before some alternative plan was proposed and in execution mode.

Please let me know what you think and whether you feel Lavo would have any problems.

Thanks,
Rogers

All of us are aware of the energy crisis confronting us, and the situation might get a lot worse this summer.  PGE has taken actions to reduce energy consumption, e.g., decreasing the amount of lighting within the building.  

In the spirit of energy conservation, Chris Calger and I are asking that you turn off your monitor(s) each day.  You do not need to log out of your computers to do this--simply press the monitor off button.  If you have any questions about how to turn off your monitor(s), check with Dave Steiner in our IT Department.

Thanks for your cooperation.

It is a little bit funny and a little bit sad watching the technology group try to get buyoff from Louise and the business units on 2002 budgets.  It is unbelievable that we can't get a project-based capital and expense budget for next year where someone like me can say I signed up for these 5 projects and willing to do them at such and such a cost.  If the project costs more then I'm not interested.  While there is definitely room for improvement on the technology side, the commercial side has room for improvement as well.

We had a very useful EES Risk / Wholesale Risk technology meeting on Friday.  It was clear from that meeting that Commercial, Technology, and Operations are not on the same page.  East Wholesale and West Wholesale Commercial aren't on the same page.  EES Commercial and ENA Commercial aren't on the same page.  EES Marketing and EES Risk may not be on the same page.  Anthony and Beth aren't on the same page.  Sally Beck's organization is organized wholesale vs retail while (at least on the power side) the commercial and technology groups are heading towards organized along commodity lines.  

For fear of sounding too dramatic ... the success of EES as well as wholesale Services deals is a function of our technology and back office.  Without it we fail.  The cost numbers are huge.  It is a critical point of competitive advantage.

It was amazing, we had a room full of talented people at this meeting on Friday;  I believe what was standing between us and a successful technology development effort was organization.  We are completely disorganized right now.  There are very few specs that are currently written to support next year's projects.  We have a completely inefficient, decentralized process for working through this stuff.

I have some thoughts that I'd like to share.  It cuts across wholesale and retail.  I think that we need a lead from commercial, technology, and operations for power (and probably gas).  I think the commercial person needs to drive the process and ultimately sign off on spending money for projects.  I think that we need one technologist in charge of all power systems.  I think that we need to look at everyone we have and choose the right person -- not necessarily the people who are currently leading this effort, although Anthony and Beth could be leading contenders.  We need Sally Beck to look at her organization and make sure that it is aligned for maximum likelihood of success.

The goal of this is not to micromanage each business unit's technology needs.  It is to coordinate and optimize across groups.  We have to make sure that we don't spend money in wholesale and retail and then develop incompatible systems.

How do you guys want to talk through this?

I know we just completed a deal with Cinergy, but I have another idea for us 
to kick around with these guys.  They are building 1,000 MWs, very efficient, 
coal facility along the Ohio river.  Talking with Ben Jacoby and Fred Mitro I 
found out that we are looking at either building a coal facility or investing 
in one, which would create a great hedge against gas.  I am beginning to go 
through the information that Ben and Fred have put together and I wanted to 
sign up a CA with Cinergy regarding this issue.  I was planning on running 
with this, but wanted to make sure this was the type of investment that we 
might be interested in.  I think a partnership in coal with Cinergy could be 
a great partnership for us.  I hope this idea is what you had in mind.  
Thanks in advance for your time.

I had a brief discussion with Marcus Buergler on Tuesday regarding the Portland space.  I indicated to him that our desire would be to move, but that we would need the current space for a short period until other arraingements can be made.  In the last two days we have done some research and think that we can get a better space for less money.  On top of that, there are roughly $600k worth of improvements (separating from PGE) that need to be made here that may not be required in a new sapce.

Based on my very brief discussion with Marcus on Tuesday, I was not aware that we wre heading down a path that would force us to stay in this building.  I learned today that the Estate has accepted the PGE lease for this space and that we have to stay here.  This is very depressing if it is true.

From a money point of view I don't think that it is the best decsion.  More importantly, from a morale point of view this place is horrible.  We have 15,000 square feet when we need between 5,000 and 10,000.  It is absolutely depressing here.  People are very much in favor of moving.

Please advise.

Total Loss of $20 million on prelim will be reduced to $13 on the final.  Mike S. reduced the NW delivered basis by $1/MWh when it should have been increased by $1/MWh against a basis position of roughly 3 million MWh accounted for the change of $6 million.  In addition, our NOB curve (which is a basis off of COB) had been mismarked (too low) by between $25/MWh to $50/MWh.  Mike doesn't know how it got marked so low.  We are short NOB, so he wasn't trying to hide money.  We are using a new curve file and position manager, so there's a chance that the application isn't working right, but it's more likely that Mike screwed something up.  Net effect of this is roughly $5 million hit (offsetting illgotten gains of the same amount before).  This brings us down to a one-day change of roughly $8 million associated with the back of the curve moving up.

With gas coming off today, the backs have moved down some.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Chip,

I have a new critical vendor with a prepetition invoice.  Arizona Public Service provides us critical transmission between the major trading points in the Southwest.  We owe them $43,708.60 for November transmission charges.  They will cut us if we do not pay.  I have explained that this payment needs to go through the creditor's cash approval process.

They can cut us starting tomorrow, but have agreed to a stay if we pay our December invoice of $8,071.20.  I will be faxing this invoice for immediate payment.

Subject: Investment Banking Fee to Bear, Stearns & Co.

In connection with our sale of shares/warrants in FirstWorld Communications 
to TPG Partners III, L.P. earlier this year, ENA engaged Bear, Stearns & Co. 
to assist ENA and Enron Communications as financial advisor and agent.  Kevin 
Garland sent me earlier this week (via Steve Horn) a copy of the 
corresponding engagement letter dated 01-Dec-99 and signed by Garland and 
Horn (and by Richard Lewis of Bear, Stearns).  It stipulates that Bear, 
Stearns shall receive as fee 2% of the aggregate consideration received by 
ENA, or $2,582,351 (plus $25,000 in out of pocket expenses).

Horn and Garland (and our accounting department) have confirmed to me that we 
have not previously paid any fee to Bear, Stearns for this transaction.  
Given the fact that the economics of the deal accrued to the account of ENA, 
it is probably only fair that we pay the fee.  I have instructed Stacy Hardy 
in accounting to wire the money prior to year end.

Sorry to hit you with this so late in the year, but I only found out about it 
two days ago.  Call me if you have questions.

CALME wants to move the turbine off their books as soon as possible. Based on

million they paid in error to Siemens Westinghouse, and that I was checking

Many of you know that my wife, Sue, and I are expecting a baby any day now.  
When Sue stopped by the office on Tuesday, we were both pleasantly surprised 
by the wonderful gift basket and gift certificate to -- you guessed it -- 
Baby's R Us that the people on the floor gave to us.  The sage advise and 
warm wishes expressed on the card were particularly appreciated.  Thank you 
so much.

as a desk that has generated a tremendous amount of cash over the last couple of years and holds vastly more margin from its counterparties than our counterparties are holding of ours, how does this policy change impact us?  i have asked this question every six months for the last two years and the answer has typically been that it is too hard to implement.  with respect to capital, the west power desk has been subsidizing other parts of ena for a while.

I am sure you expected me to comment on EOL at some point - but just in case 
you don't see the attached reporting.  Essentially in power we are now doing 
the same volume as the Intercontinental Exchange.  If you want reports like 
this, Justin Rostant can produce whatever you wish.

Yesterday:
ICE   1,892,800 MWhs
EnronOnline 1,843,874 MWhs (plus 124,850 MWhs financial)

See attached.

Jeff Richter will be transitioning off of the Short Term California trading desk and on to the EES Risk Management team during the next several weeks.  Jeff will be taking an important leadership role, joining the management team with Don Black and Rogers Herndon.  Jeff, Don, and Rogers will report jointly to me and Kevin Presto.  While Jeff will be sorely missed in his current role managing the Short Term California desk, his trading and technology skills are sorely needed on the EES side of the business.  Over the next couple of weeks we will sort out the new responosibilities on the Short Term California desk.

Mike, sorry for the delay..... lots going on including low value add in board 
meetings and PRC's.

Lets set up this discussion with the following points:
 a) we are not exiting Argentina;
 b) we need to right-size the overall organization to fit the business 
opportunity;
 c) if possible on the commercial front, I would like to consolidate 
intellectual assets to one location in order to generate greater 
productivity, increased team work, a flatter org chart, real time decision 
making and greater communication;
 d) we need to continue to maintain a strong presence (including customer 
coverage) in both markets including an office in Argentina; and
 e) I would like to consolidate all non-commercial activity for ESA to Sao 
Paulo.

Ultimately, I would like a very flat, commercially focused trading and 
origination organization (given limited resources) that prioritizes resources 
based on the highest value transactions independent of geography, retail vs 
wholesale or development vs commodity. However, I want to keep a strong 
presence in both markets and understand the language, political and cultural 
issues. I may be asking for my cake and eat it too; however, I believe that 
you guys will find the balance.  There is no need for you to leave Argentina 
- its up to you, Joe and Orlando to determine consistent with the business 
model we are trying to move forward.

Propose to me a plan that manages your concerns but gets us as close to these 
ideals as possible at a cost that is reasonable.  Please work with Joe and 
Orlando as part of this process.

Regards
Delainey

I called him at home last night.  His absence from the office this week was somewhat unplanned.  He is at home with his kids as his mother inlaw is taking a break for the week (remember, he has four kids, including a two-month old baby and his son Erik who has had a variety of health problems).  He is planning on coming in at the end of the week to interview some internal people for a job on the services desk.  I agree that it looks like he is out of here, but he gave me no indication.  I think that we should sit tight for a few days.  I will know when he's coming in to do the services interviews.  Perhaps Amy should have a conversation with him at that time.

future?!?  Life in Calgary must seem very far away...  

I hope that you and Donna are doing well in Houston.  How many children do 
you have now?  Is Donna working, or enjoying life at home?

I am doing well.  I am located in Oxford, and work part time at Enron 
Direct.  I have a 17 month old daughter who keeps me busy when I'm not at

I hope that all is well with you.

Mike signed on Friday which is great news.  Richter, Heizenrader, and I are all waiting on language that gets us comfortable with the California litigation risk.  In case you were wondering, we are not talking to one another about this language.  Each person is working independently on this.  We have been waiting on Michele Cash for a week now on proposed language (and for me, a copy of Enron's corporate bylaws explaining officer indemnification).  I will keep you posted.

Brett, since Enron owns NEPCO - true risk transfer under a fixed price 
contract is difficult.  However, I do like the behaviour that you get from 
such accountability (ie) high incentive to get done on time and on budget.  
My experience with NEPCO on cost plus has been very unfavourable (don't like 
#1).  I will be supportive of any structure that aligns our interests 
appropriately.  You might want to bounce a few ideas off Dan.  I have already 
given him a heads up on the value at stake if we can come in at the low end 
of the scale and early.

Drop me a note on where you end up.

Subject: EPC for Eletrobolt

Dave:

Do you have any general guidance on how you would like for me to approach the 
EPC contract with NEPCO Houston?  The three options that we currently have on 
the table are:

Fixed engineering/internal costs with pass-through on external costs with fee.
Same structure with cap.
Fixed price contract.

Our last conversation was very focused on a fixed price contract.  My 
conversations with Dan Leff were moving in the direction of one or two.  My 
concern on a fixed price number is the timing and my negotiating position, 
but I understand your issues.  Any general thoughts would be helpful.

Thanks,
Brett

Guys, we appreciate your efforts on this project but we will not be needing 
your services as owners engineer on the Vitro project.  I will honor our 
agreement on the sell down; however, we have sufficient technical talent

Steve and Bob:

I know that John Normand told you yesterday that he had sign-off up his chain 
of command on the deal you negotiated with him.  However, Dick apparently 
does not agree with John or has had second thoughts.  Please review the 
attached memo and let's discuss next steps.  It would also be helpful if one 
of you would get a download from John as to the reason behind this change in 
position.

Best regards - Max


Note to Dave:  I suggest that Steve, Bob and I take this up with Dick before 
involving you.  This is a 180 degree turn from what we had been discussing 
with Dick, John Normand and the rest of their team.  Dick and I were supposed 
to have a 1 pm video call today to confirm the deal that had been worked out, 
but he cancelled the call when he sent his e-mail to me.  We'll figure out 
what's up and keep you posted./ Max

Dave,

Yes,  I've got these set up.

On a separate topic, I received a visit from D. Liebert (working for Dan L. 
on EE&CC) to discuss the memo I sent out on the Tech Services Group.    
During the discussion we identified several areas where EES' view diverges 
from the view in my memo that ENA will manage its own technical risk and will 
be supported by EE&CC.      Currently, EES is headed in the following 
direction:

1. EE&CC will manage all technical risk in Enron as part of a consolidated 
technical risk book. 
2. EE&CC will be the sign off on all DASH's with respect to technical risk.
3. EE&CC is still trying to work out how their services will be charged to 
the business units - not sure what "cost" is.

This central decision is (1.) above.  If EES is going to manage ENA's 
technical risk then the balance between managing engineering cost and 
managing technical risk will be eliminated.  Essentially we will be back to a 
ENA (origination) vs. EE&CC (construction) relationship where we argue about 
how much money they are spending and the amount of overhead that is included 
in their "cost".  Your thoughts on this?

We didn't draw any lines and agreed to keep discussing to make this work.  I 
would suggest that either I can meet with Dan L. to understand his views or 
that we have another joint meeting with you and Dan's team to resolve.

Regards,
Brian

own throught Q2 - charged to the OOC;
 b) driftPrepay - shows the detail as provided netting drift and pre-pay

offset by larger monetizations;
 c) Summary - overall completed income statement - note that non-external 
capital charges are added back to reach EBIT;
 d) commercial income - guts of the commercial budget;
 e) group expenses - shows the detail on ENA net groups expenses, EIS/ENW/IT 
non-allocable, corporate charges not allocated to specific commercial groups 
and bonus/other comp;
 f) HP&L - takes a cut at HP&L income statement and balance sheet in 2001 
assuming a sale by the end of Q2 - this needs some sit down work with Redmond;
 g) Balance Sheet Allocations - this defines by group the capital employed, 
assets to be sold and new capital expenditures expected in 2001 - then 
calculates a net capital and depreciation charge;
 h) Balance Sheet - this defines the existing balance sheet with no 
anticipated sales or increases by vehicle (ie) Enserco, JEDI, etc - merchant 
investments are charged @ a blended rate of 15% and strategic investments are 
charged @ a blended rate of 9%.

Two action items:
 a) Print out for John - Commercial Income  & Summary worksheets for his 
comment and review &
 b) Start putting completed commercial packages together for 
distribution/further comment by the business units in the next couple of 
weeks - include detailed income statement, headcount, balance sheet 
(including expected increases,decreases, capital charge and depreciation), 
leave pages open for goals & objectives and target customer list.  I would 
like to review format and detail for each group before distribution.

Hey Dave, what's the real deal on the 7FA "swap" with Larry Izzo? Do they 
have the capability to give us another 7FA in 2001-2002? I listened to two 
voicemails from Cogentrix this am and they do seem to be serious about 
purchasing an incremental 1-2 7FA's if they can be delivered by winter 2002. 
I think their preference is to buy the turbine from us on the front end with 
no partnering in the project. There has been no serious negotiation on this 
to date and I don't want Scott to waste his time if we really don't have the 
turbine from EE&CC. Please advise. Thanks.

Per our telephone conversation today, I have been asked by two Cogentrix

2002) available for sale. I believe that Cogentrix needs the turbine for one 
of the combined cycle projects it has been permitting in Entergy or TVA. They 
seen somewhat anxious.

As we discussed, I will let Cogentrix know about the availability of the two 
General Electric 7EA's and the two Westinghouse 501-D's. What about the 7FA 
that Dave Delainey loaned to EE&CC, could this turbine be available for sale 
to Cogentrix?

I would like to re-emphasize our commitment to you and your team in ensuring 
this project is successful.  As we had discussed we are very eager to provide 
Project Management services for the Millenia project.  In fact Audrey and I 
am visiting BCCK this Friday to be sure we are not leaving anything else on 
the table which Enron could capture.  We in fact have identified one of our 
PMs, who has over 20 years experience in the industry, to lead the project.  
He will be augmented by Audrey who is not only a terrific process engineer 
but is managing the Lost Creek process plant/compressor station intallation 
in Wyoming.

My team is also managing the implementation of the Fort Union Gas Gathering 
project in Wyoming.

I understand things are heating up and all of us are looking forward to you 
kicking off the project.  Please feel free to call me at x58273.

Dave,

As part of my ongoing effort to maintain a high level of morale within the 
group, I would like to undertake a couple of outings during the first half of 
the year.  Given the fact that I now report to you directly and these outings 
will involve spending some money, I don't want to commit to anything before 
reaching agreement with you on the following:

Weekend offsite in Galveston (at Hotel Galvez) in April.  Group dinner on 
Friday, Golf at Galveston Country Club on Saturday morning, meetings and 
beach time during afternoon/evening on Saturday, group deep sea fishing 
outing on Sunday.  Given that the capacity of the boat exceeds the number of 
people in my group, I intend to invite one or more other groups from ENA as a 
way of fostering better communications.  Total cost of the entire weekend 
should not exceed $15,000.00.

Team building exercise on Mt. Hood (Oregon) in July.  Despite my present 
residence in Houston, I previously lived for many years in Europe, including 
4+ years in Switzerland.  During this time, I became an avid mountain 
climber.  I would like to take as many member of my group as are willing to 
climb Mt. Hood (which I have climbed several times - not a huge challenge).  
Given Mt. Hood's proximity to Portland, I would of course combine this with 
half a day spent with Chris Calger and his group (and may even invite them to 
accompany us).  Total cost would be around $450 per person plus 
transportation. 

I would like to go ahead and finalize arrangements for the above unless you 
have strenuous objections.  Please let me know.

Subject: Genco Services Agreement

Dave,

We had a good meeting with Presto today.  We came away with a broad T&M 
outline.  One concern that Kevin raised is our ability to actually do a 
"services agreement" for the risk management and back offices aspect of 
NewCo.  Apparently, he said a number of issues have bubbled up recently with 
our systems in terms of manpower, age of system, and ability to take on 
additional load.  He said throwing on an incremental 4000-5000 MWs with NewCo 
may prove to be too much to handle.  He also raised the "confidentiality 
issue".  It is his view that NewCo should have this capability in-house 
anyway (obviously that was always the long term intent, with this services 
agreement more a bridge).

Several options exist.
1.  Force a 12-24 month services agreement through the system (solve our 
problems with more people, etc).

2.  Agree to set up NewCo's system using our unique expertise and experience. 
We would do this for a fee (say $15MM?).   One issue here is just NewCo's 
ability to get this done in conjunction with everything else in time to do 
IPO.

3. Investigate what type of system FPLe is using today.  Since we are not 
increasing net merchant MWs on day 1, FPLe's system could serve as the 
platform for future MW expansion.  Maybe Enron comes in and expands/redesigns 
system for a fee?  I believe that FPLe has just recently expanded/updated 
their system.  I would like to try to learn more about their system.

Let me know if you have a preference or any additional thoughts.  I think we 
can make money off of all three options.

Thanks,

Don

Dave,

Thanks for following through with the contact.  As we discussed, the 
discussions we had with Calpine were at a local level and very preliminary, 
with Bridgeline indicating to Calpine that we are always open to looking at 
ways that will enhance shareholder value.  I agree with you that at this time 
it has a low probability of evolving into anything.  

On a separate note, I would like to take you up on your offer of your time 
and resources.  I know that Bridgeline is a very small component of the 
things that are on your radar screen, but if it is not too much of an 
imposition, I would like to have a one on one discussion with you concerning 
a few of the issues we discussed at the management committee mtg.

I want to make sure that I am crystal clear on the perspectives and desires 
of both parents.  Coming from Texaco, I feel like I have a good feel for 
Texaco's short and long term expectations for the partnership, however I 
would like to dig a little deeper with you on a few of the issues we 
discussed at the management committee mtg, and a couple of your points in 
your follow up email to me.

The afternoon or evening would work best for me, and I would be happy to pick 
up the tab for dinner one night if that fits with your schedule.  The balance 
of this week is kind of tight, however, the week of September 2nd and 9th are 
fairly open with the exception of Tuesday night the 3rd.

Thanks for your help, look forward to talking to you soon.

Randy, Scott Healy contacted Bob Kelly at Calpine about Calpine's potential

Dave, since the ENA power desk will be receiving 100% of all earnings related 
to the City of Austin capacity, it's only appropriate that any cost overruns 
will be sent directly to their P/L. There isn't anything that leads me to 
believe there will be overruns, but you know how that goes with NEPCO and I 
want to be very clear up front that if something should occur, I have no 
ability to offset the cost with other Austin earnings. 

I'd also like to set aside some time when we can talk thru several business 
items/issues. The teaser list is as follows:  continuing internal noise 
between the desks and origination groups related to deals and primarily the 
P/L split (any maybe a few solutions), the followup and status and 
recommendations on the global LNG business and ENA's interest (I've had 
meetings with Doug Rotenburg, Vince Kiminski, others, and new info from our 
Duke meeting), status of Chicago office, clarification on leftover items from 
Columbia acquisition last year, employee hiring/contracts,  etc.

Maybe we can get together this afternoon or tomorrow. How about the status of 
the FP&L meeting with Jim Broadhead?

Hey guys. I would like an outline of the City of Austin project as far as how 
this will be managed from ENA's standpoint. My understanding is that Jeff 
Keenan will be the Project Manager for ENA and will be entirely responsible 
for the implementation of all aspects to bring the plant to commercial 
operations. This would include schedule, permitting, interconnect agreements, 
managing NEPCO to the $88.3 million total cost, etc. Everyone needs to 
realize that this team will realize a true loss on any overruns above the 
$88.3 million. I've asked Tammy Shepherd to set up a budget, schedule and 
weekly distribution similarly to how we handled Doyle and the other projects. 
I'm assuming that this team is managing everything related to the Austin 
project and is accountable for its successful implementation. 

If we need to discuss anything related to the above, let me know.  Thanks.

Following is a clarification note that I forwarded to Whalley this AM.

Subject: UC/CSU Procedural Next Steps

As you know, UC/CSU sued us for breach of contract in March.  At the same 
time they moved for a preliminary injunction to restore them to direct access 
during the pendency of the case.  The district court granted their motion and 
issued the preliminary injunction.  We appealed the granting of a preliminary 
injunction in these circumstances, and, in addition, asked the Court of 
Appeals to stay the effect of the district court's order until our appeal 
could be heard.

The Court of Appeals granted our request for a stay.  Because of the 
similarity beween the legal tests for granting a stay and for granting of 
preliminary injunction, to grant the stay the Court of Appeals necessarily 
had to find, at least preliminarily, that the district court likely erred in 
granting the preliminary injunction.  This is why we think we will win our 
appeal, especially if it is heard by the same panel.  (Whether or not it is 
heard by the same panel depends on the clerk of the Court of Appeals and the 
schedules of the judges.)

We filed our brief in support of our appeal on May 14.  UC/CSU's and the AG's 
answering briefs must be filed by June 11.  Our reply brief is due 14 days 
after their briefs are filed.  The appeal is then referred to a 3-judge 
panel.  Oral argument is usually allowed.

If we win the appeal, UC/CSU campuses in PG&E and SCE territory remain on 
utililty service until a final decision is made in the case.   If we lose the 
appeal, we have to take them back until a final decision in made in the 
case.  The appeal relates only to the preliminary injunction.  The breach of 
contract action remains to be tried at the district court level.  

The contract expires March 31, 2002.  In the ordinary course a final decision 
in the case would not be made by then.  The judge, however, could expedite 
the proceedings so that a decision could be made earlier.  UC/CSU could also 
move for summary judgment, arguing that that facts are not in dispute and 
that the judge should rule without a trial.  In either event, it would seem 
unlikely that a final decision even on a expedited basis could be handed down 
before late fall/winter.

Please call me with any questions.  Thanks.

Subject: End of Year Bonus

--  PLEASE DISREGARD IF YOU RECEIVED AN E-MAIL FROM ME ON 1-9-01 (I was 
having trouble with the network in Houston)

Dave,

The attached spreadsheet outlines my recommendations on proposed changes to 
the bonus distribution.

In regard to my expectations, I am expecting a significant increase from last 
years bonus for the following reason.

It was my strategic decision to:
pursue the asset development business in conjunction with other business 
lines (made and received approval to hire the necessary people and execute 
the strategy from Kevin Hannon).
close both Wind and Powder projects simultaneously versus only focus on the 
Powder River Project (know one thought that both could get done in a 7 week 
time frame. At the risk of not being able to get either closed, I went out on 
the limb and sent Whitt to negotiate and close Wind River ($72 MM) while I 
negotiated and closed Powder River ($75 MM).
it was my idea to create Enron Midstream Services and develop a gathering 
business in the Powder. That decision enable us to hedge our firm transport 
decision on Fort Union and enabled us to receive $54 million for the sale of 
the business
I made the  call and initiated the joint bid between Northern Border and ENA 
to acquire a combined 49% interest in Bighorn Gas Gathering.  We sold our 
interest to NBP for $22 MM
I initiated the discussions, structured the transaction, negotiated the value 
and closed Project 20/20 with NBP.  There was a point in the negotiations 
where it was known that I was going with NBP and therefore had to take a 
neutral position.  However, by that time, the value had been established and 
many contentious issues regarding valuation had been agreed upon
it was my call to preserve value in the transaction and have myself and a 
team of 12 others go over to NBP versus have them deduct the cost associated 
with a Management Services Agreement from the purchase price.  This saved ENA 
over $20 MM in value.  Needless to say, we are now having to deal with 
managing a highly aggressive budget and adjust to a very different management 
style and compensation plan. I feel personally that ENA was the primary 
beneficiary of the higher valuation.  As you can appreciate, I have a 
personal issue with this and would like this to be considered for bonus 
determination.

In general, I think Project 20/20 was just part of my contribution to ENA 
during my tenure in Denver.  In total, this office has generated in excess of 
$150 million in earnings with no remaining risk potential.  I have been 
fortunate to have hired a solid team that approached many of the projects we 
worked on in a team manner.  I think that approach has been successful and I 
am hopeful that major contributors on the team will be compensated 
appropriately.

I appreciate your consideration Dave!  Please let me know if you have any 
questions or thoughts regarding this e-mail.

Brian

Hi Dave,
I would like to have the opportunity to speak with you regarding the roles 
that certain individuals played in closing the Project 20/20 transaction and 
provide you with input on how to rationalize bonus amounts relative to 
everyone's performance rankings and contributions to 20/20.  I am open to 
your suggestion as to when and how best to convey my thoughts on this issue.

Hope you had a good holiday and look forward to talking with you soon.

Dave,

I have taken the "communicate your ideas to the right person" to heart.  One 
of the main reasons I came to Enron was to help expand it marketing efforts.  
I have taken a few minutes to write my idea, because verbal ideas can get 
lost in the shuffle.  I feel strongly about this opportunity and this notion 
is what attracted me back to the Big E.  I believe all the pieces of this 
idea are present at Enron, but we can maximize our resources.

one project in Texas and one in California which are well down the

December 2001 COD in order to get the tax credit, I would suggest that we 
purchase the development sites and turbines from Enron Wind and keep the 
asset, commodity position, tax credit and possible green credits in ENA.  
They are Ok with that strategy.  This is an opportuntity that needs to

Subject: DQE -- Impact of Operating at Reduced Capacity: PRIVILEGED AND 
CONFIDENTIAL

Our memorandum of today's date on the DQE facilities estimates a 65% to 70% 
likelihood of the facilities qualifying for section 29 tax credits, based on 
projected volumes of 225 tons per hour.

As we discussed a week ago, if we operate the facilities at a volume of 118 
per hour, (i.e., half-capacity), we believe we would alleviate the tax risk 
associated with the increase in capacity.  The question is, does that 
improvement in the odds with respect to that one issue improve the 
bottom-line odds on qualification at least with respect to the base volume of 
118 per hour from the 65% to 70% estimate that we specified in our memorandum?

We think it does, but we are not sure that there will be a material 
improvement.  We have passed that question on to our outside tax counsel, and 
will let you know his view.  

As we noted last week, there are several legal issues for which, while we 
think we have the better argument, there is no definitive legal precedent.  
Even pulling the capacity issue out of the equation --which is what we would 
be doing if we are only considering the 118 tons -- there are still several 
other balls in the air, and we would have to catch each and every one in 
order to have a tax-creditworthy facility.  When you look at each issue, 
separately, it seems possible to get comfortable as to each one, but when you 
consider that there are several such issues, and that we have to be "right" 
each and every time, you have to lower your overall odds.  Statistically 
speaking, if you are 80% comfortable as to each of 5 separate issues, then 
you would expect to hit on 4 out of 5, not on 5 out of 5, but we can't lose 
on any one issue and still qualify for credits. 

Obtaining a private letter ruling from the IRS as to these issues, which is 
our ultimate goal, would take these issues out of the air, so to speak, but 
that's not going to happen pre-close, and no matter what assurances we might 
get at a pre-ruling conference with the IRS, unless and until you actually 
get the ruling, there is an element of risk that you have to assume.  For 
that reason, the 90% probability number that I threw out at last week's 
meeting in response to a question about what our comfort level would be if we 
had a private letter ruling is really a red herring, because at decision 
time, there's not going to be a ruling in hand.  

As noted above, I will let you know what Bruce Lemons' view is, since he is 
the one who will be called upon to give an opinion. Hopefully, that will be 
later today.

Dave,

Congratulations on your appointment to CEO - what's next?  

I am working with Bryan and Ray on the transition, everything seems to be 
going along smoothly.  Bryan is comfortable with me moving as soon as EBS has 
physical space for me as long as I am available to him by phone.  I expect to 
move next week.

I am working on a scheme with Wes on marking the swaps on Garden State 
without fair valuing the asset.  Citibank and National Bank of Canada are 
interested, and the trade should improve the economics as a result of trading 
with a strong credit (bank) as opposed to a stand alone operation (Garden 
State).  I should have more feedback by the end of the week.

Thank you for your support on my move to EBS.  I have really enjoyed working 
with you and appreciate what you have done for me.  Working with you, Greg 
and Rodney has really improved my management, finance and structuring skills 
that I expect to apply at EBS.

Call me if there is anything I can ever to do to support you.  I look forward 
to working with you again.  

Thanks for being a terrific boss and good friend.

Regards,

Edward

mature investments and influence/generate value from the earlier stage

Enron will take the initiative and help IEP jump-start the PR effort by the 
end of the week.  I spoke with Smutney this evening.  He likes the idea of 
Enron taking the lead with McNally/Temple.  I've emailed him the one-pager we 
worked up today.--Palmer, Steffes, Dasovich,Parquet
The urgency for a solution is growing and a vaccuum has formed, with many 
trying to fill the void.  The Cal. Manufacturers Ass. has called a meeting 
with IEP and the utilities.  Dave Parquet and Doug Condon will attend.
I spoke with the VP of Strategic Planning at the ISO today who said there is 
a "98% chance" that price caps will be on the agenda at the August ISO Board 
meeting.
Dave Parquet continues to check with SDG&E to determine when SDG&E plans to 
make an announcement about what it intends to do with the offers it received 
last week.
Dave Parquet is working with Andy Kellerman and J. Steffes to try and get the 
investment community energized on this issue.
The issue is now apparently affecting California legislative races.  Staffers 
are drafting a bill that an "at risk" Democrat Senator from San Diego will 
carry, with the hope of using the bill to get the bump necessary to win the 
election.  Mona will meet with the staffer on Thursday to find out what he 
has in mind for the bill and to communicate our views.
Dasovich will meet with Commissioner Bilas Wednesday to see if the Republican 
block of the California PUC is hanging tough.

That's it from our end.

Best,
Jeff

Ike, with the danger of being too presumptious,  I thought I would follow up

that we can ensure that we are comparing "apples to apples".  I would also 
suggest that each party provide sufficient back-up to justify their numbers.  
It may also be helpful for TVA and EPMI to use an independent party, such as 
Charles Bone, as the intermediary to facilitate the transfer of each parties 
settlement offer.

I am in the office over the next several days. Lets discuss at your earliest 
convenience.

As we discussed today, I am sending you this preliminary list of the Calme 
employees.  I will also fax a copy to your attention at the Drake Hotel.

We still have some work in progress on the allocations of certain people.

Upon your return we can begin to review the individuals on the list.

The enclosed list indicates the current proposed "New Roles" for each of the 
Calme employees.  As mentioned on the phone, we've allocated the employees 
among:  

Deploy immediately (however, certain individuals will have residual jobs to 
complete)
Transition Team (TT) to carry out the deployments and asset disposals
LNG/Middle East to go to EGM
Southern Cone (SC) (for Venezuela and Colombia businesses)
EES (which primarily include our development engineers and certain 
technical/operations people)

The table also indicates the Calme senior people (Resp Pty) assigned to 
ensure that no individual falls through the cracks.

The column "Calme" merely indicates our current internal sub-groupings, and 
you may wish to ignore it.

Please give me a call if you have any questions.

a)  I do not believe Skilling is aware of the latest updates on our efforts

it was brought to his attention was March 1999 (Blue Range default).  We do 
report our top exposures to him and the Board which includes CNR, 
Petro-Canada, and Talisman on a quarterly basis.  Rob and team are actively 
working with my team to mitigate exposures through other measures.
b) I will be happy to provide insight as needed.  The riskiest commercial 
objections are from Lagrasta's group.
c) We have received margin from Sempra and Duke.  We have a valuation dispute 
with Statoil and are actively working through the details.

Let me know if you need further information.

Subject: Excess Credit Exposure

Guys, I went throught the Credit Margin Exception Report for 4/24/00.  This 
shows our excess credit exposure at approximately $ 391M (after guarantees).  
I have a couple of questions:

 a) Canada (>$200M) - Rick/Bill/Rob - Is the board and Skilling aware of the 
credit positions and OK?   I know Rob has been working on    mitigation plans;
 b) Commercial Objections: (>$67M)
  - Paper - Edward ($27M) - The report shows a number of commerical 
objections to calling for collateral ie) Repap,  Times Mirror and Waste   
Mgt. Can you give me a call to discuss - we may need documentation to support;
  - Gas/Mid-Mkt - Jeff ($29M)- Do you own Cross Timbers Oil Co, Torch Energy, 
Aurora Natural Gas, Seneca Resource Corp and Cody Energy?   We have in these 
cases additional commercial objections to calling for collateral - lets 
discuss;
  - Mariner  ($9M)- Ray we are showing a collateral need of approx. $9.0M - 
given our equity position this may be moot;however, lets discuss.
 c) Margin Call (>$51M) - Rick/Bill - have we been successful in getting the 
margin posted by Sempra, Statoil and Duke?

Canada is a tricky issue; however, we should be able to work down the 
commercial objections and collect on the margin calls to get the number down.

Subject: EES Pinnacle Event

Dave/Janet,

As you guys like a no bullshit approach, last Fall, I voiced my concerns to 
the EES management team about the second Pinnacle event (see link below).

http://pinnacle2001.proghq.com/index.html

My concerns in no particular order were:

1) Given that we have a generous bonus programme to reward staff, I felt the 
need for such an over the top event like an all expenses paid holiday in the 
West Indies for "key" staff and their spouses was unnecessary.
2) The lack of transparent selection criteria ("selected Superior and 
Excellent performers") was devisive would inevitably piss off the vast 
majority of EES who didn't go on the trip.
3) Apart from disagreeing with the whole idea, I disagreed with the fact that 
all the MDs automatically got to go as that implied they were all performing 
and deserved it.
4) I didn't believe that, overall, the business was making enough money to 
justify a "reward"  trip like this.
5) I didn't want to take my best guys out of the office for up to a week as 
we have a lot of work to do and won't make the numbers sat on a beach
6) The Europe wide Enron team works well together and there would be no way 
of justifying this trip to the rest of the London office (non EES) who 
obviously would see it for what it is - a waste of time and money

Tom conceded by saying that this one would probably be the last event of its 
kind.  Others remained silent.

I withdrew Europe from the event on the grounds that culturally in Europe 
this event was unacceptable.  Stephen Peterson (in the Europe team)  appears 
on the list of attendees, but will not attend for the reasons outlined above 
and he is OK with it.  Afterwards, I found out that McCarty boycotted the 
first event the year before for the same reasons.

Whatever you guys decide to do, Europe remains committed to hitting the 
numbers and being part of the team.

Matthew

Subject: Gleason

Bob Virgo has informed me that the desk wants to convert Gleason to combined 
cycle.  Bob told me this in the context of asking me whether Calpine would 
sell us any additional combined cycle equipment (i.e., steam turbines).  My 
guess is they won't.

If 1) it was of interest to us and 2) we are really going to convert Gleason, 
I think I could get Calpine to execute a purchase/short term tolling 
transaction on Gleason on favorable terms.  I say this for the following 
reasons:

1.  Calpine is typically a strong bid for combined cycle installations.
2.  Calpine has been trying unsuccessfully to get a combined cycle project in 
TVA (due to their rank in the cue) and thinks that it will take them a year 
to get through TVA.  We actually think that their project is blocked. 
3.  Calpine would likely take the incremental construction cost risk on the 
transaction.
4.  I believe that Calpine would undertake the permitting and interconnection 
work at their cost  and risk, if needed.  Given the cost of preparing a 
combined cycle permit along with the potential fight that ENA might face from 
TVA in such an effort, this risk sharing scenario could be attractive to ENA.
5.  Calpine would likely accept a short term tolling arrangement.  On their 
eastern assets, Calpine is generally executing 1-2 year deals.
6.  Calpine particularly in the east has been aggressively purchasing 
projects.
7.  If feasible, Calpine would probably be willing to further increase the 
size of Gleason.  Calpine's current plants announcements are generally in the 
700-1,000 MW range.

I know that Dave Delainey has not previously supported selling Gleason 
individually.  However, you may want to investigate if anything has changed 
in this circumstance, particularly since we are not generally a strong bid 
for combined cycle projects.  Please let me know. 

FYI--Dave Duran and I are meeting with Bob Kelly of Calpine on next Tuesday 
to discuss the use of Enron NOLs in Calpine's PG&E contract buyouts.

Guys, I would like to schedule a one hour meeting to discuss the 2000 and 
2001 IT budget.  Essentially, I would like this first meeting to discuss our 
approach to a) understanding in some detail our 2000 costs and the 
nature/behaviour of those costs and b) in this context, ENA's priorities and 
the system plan, come up with the 2001 budget and how the accountability will 
be managed.

Kay, can you please try to organize ASAP.

Regards
Delainey

Guys, attached you will find a preliminary agenda for the 2000 ENA Offsite.  
As leaders of the organization, you have been invited to participate in a two 
day offsite where business 2001 objectives and strategies for ENA will be 
discussed.  It is scheduled to occur December 14th and 15th at the Venetian 
in Las Vegas.

This is the forum to ensure that your point of view and ideas can be heard 
and incorporated into our plans and iniatives as such I would encourage 
everyone to attend and to stay for the entire period.  In particular, we 
would like everyone to stay over Friday night and leave Saturday morning.

ENA public relations (Dorie) will manage all the logistics including air fare.

Final invitations, details and agenda will follow shortly.



Regards
Dave and John

Guys, attached you will find a final cut on the ENA 2001 expense budget.  
Please review and make any adjustments to your existing plan that are 
appropriate to hit the net ENA target.  In order to stay flat year on year, I 
split the remaining positive variance equally across the groups.  As we had 
discussed earlier, these costs will not be allocated to the business units 
and will be tracked on the ENA income statement below the line and the 
accountability managed by each of you.  All outside variable costs, 
specifically related to specific deals, will be charged to the business units 
eg) outside legal and tax, outside technical expertise, facility costs, 
outside research support, incremental back and mid office support for 
specific asset management deals, specific entertainment, etc.  I look at this 
cost structure as the minimum capacity charge we need to operate our business 
and evaluate/manage our risks.

Wes, can you please  finalize the one page plan (expenses and headcount) for 
each group with these changes.



Regards
Delainey

Chris McGill  of AGA  called Margaret Carson and asked her  to speak to the 
gas distribution members of the  AGA  at their monthly meeting on  September  
19th.    If you don't know her, Margaret works under me and provides research 
for Govt Affairs and business units throughout Enron.
 
The  topic of the presentation is --  
What  current  prices for natural gas mean for gas distributors and their 
strategies for asset management?  
Who, if anyone, would you like us to pass this along to?   Give me a call if 
you need more information.

Dave,

I would like to have a mid-year offsite with my group in late July.  I would 
like to include the associates and west CTG folks since they are a 
significant part of our team and we have a tremendous amount of work to do 
for the balance of the year.  We will keep costs reasonable by going to a 
resort that is driving distance from Portland.  Total cost is estimated at 
$23M.  We will have 1.5 days in conference and .5 days of activity (golf, 
etc.).  My assistant will send details to Kay.  Are you OK with this?

Regards,

Chris

Subject: 


Dick,

I have done some more research on the cost versus Peaker Fee issue.  The 
numbers from ENA's side lay out as follows:

ENA Payments vs. NEPCO Costs  $4,449,000
ABB Breaker Costs/Estimate to Complete $   720,000
Reduction in Variable Overheads  $3,000,000
IDC on ENA Overpayments   $   200,000
Fixed Overhead Charged to Variable  $   180,000
Westinghouse L.D.'s- Gleason   $1,800,000
Westinghouse L.D.'s- Wheatland  $   500,000
Preliminary Total Reduction
in Project Costs                  $10,849,000


ENA Payments vs. NEPCO Costs:  ENA paid according to pre-determined cash 
curves every month.  NEPCO's actual costs appear to be coming in about $4.5 
MM less per the audit results that we both reviewed last Friday.

ABB Breaker Costs/Estimate to Complete:  When we met last Friday, there were 
$1,459,000 of Open P.O.'s and other items that NEPCO still needed to 
investigate and closeout, you have a copy of the detailed schedule prepared 
by Amy Spoede.  Of the $1,459,000, there was $720,000 showing as still owing 
to ABB for Circuit Breakers at Wilton Center.  ABB has informed ENA that they 
have been payed in full for quite some time, thus I believe that this 
$720,000 is an accounting phantom that NEPCO needs to clear up.

Reduction in Variable Overheads:  The $3,000,000 in variable overhead 
reduction is the number that you offered to cut this cost in our meeting last 
Friday.

IDC on ENA Overpayments:  As part of our agreement with EE&CC/NEPCO, ENA 
agreed to pay 2000 peaker construction costs based upon cash curves versus 
actual invoices.  The cash curves consistently overestimated NEPCO's actual 
disbursements, even after quarterly audits and true-ups.  NEPCO currently 
owes ENA over $200,000 in IDC at the cost of capital charged by Enron Corp.

Fixed Overhead Charged to Variable:  Some EE&CC/NEPCO personnel coded time 
against variable overheads that should have been charged against the 
pre-agreed fixed overheads. 

Westinghouse L.D.'s:  ENA paid Westinghouse directly for the turbines.  ENA 
has held back $3.5 MM of retainage pending resolution of L.D.'s.  
EE&CC's/ENA's position is that Westinghouse owes $2.3 MM of L.D.'s ($1.8 MM @ 
Gleason, $0.5MM @ Wheatland).  The aforementioned L.D.'s are for delivery and 
schedule delays at Gleason and Wheatland.  There is an additional $1.0-1.6 MM 
of performance L.D.'s for missing heat rate guarantees at Gleason.  ENA will 
negotiate the performance L.D. settlement directly with Westinghouse because 
the cure will be getting additional MW's in trade against the L.D.'s.  
Otherwise, Westinghouse can cure by minor unit modifications and re-test 
versus paying cash L.D.'s.  However, the Delivery and Schedule L.D.'s will 
still be negotiated by EE&CC.

Peaker Fee Settlement:  Based on our last meeting and additional research, I 
suggest the following path to quickly resolve the Peaker fee amount and 
payment.  If EE&CC will take over the risk/reward of the Delivery & Schedule 
L.D. issue with Westinghouse, then ENA will recharacterize the amounts 
detailed above as Peaker fee payment.  If EE&CC is successful in keeping all 
the Schedule L.D.'s from Westinghouse, then it would have a $10.85 MM fee 
versus $9.2 MM.  EE&CC only needs to keep $650,000 of the $2.3 MM of 
Westinghouse Schedule L.D.'s to have a $9.2 MM fee.

Please let me know how you would like to proceed from here.

Regards,

Mike J Miller

Dave --

Effective May 19, I have replaced Elisabeth McCabe as head of ENA's Public 
Relations department.  With the recent reconfiguration of the ENA staff 
meeting, public relations has not been included.  I believe it is important 
to be in attendance at the weekly staff meetings, so public relations can 
stay abreast of the various deals/projects and be prepared to handle the 
public relations surrounding them.

I would like to request that I be added to the list of regular attendees.  
Additionally, I believe it would be helpful for Kathryn Corbally from 
Corporate Investor Relations to be in attendance as well.  She attended the 
meetings in the past and should be included for the same reasons.  If you 
would like to discuss this issue, please call me at ext. 3-9053.

Thanks.

Dave:

Some time ago, I had received approval to purchase the primary block of land 
for the Rio project site from Jim.  One year ago, we had acquired the rights 
to purchase the land under an option agreement.  This agreement is about to 
expire and we are currently closing the transaction to purchase the land.  
The total purchase price of the block is $1.7 million.  This closing is to 
take place tomorrow.  Given the changes, I thought I should run this by you 
to make sure you would be in agreement.  I had hoped that this would be a 
moot point with the Petrobras agreement closed.  However, I think we may be a 
couple more days on that.  I am very concerned with waiting on the landowner 
given that our option agreement will be expiring.  Please let me know if it 
is ok to move forward with the land purchase.

Thanks,
Brett

Sorry that my arrangements with Jana G. in the Associates Program to change 
the date of the Associates PRC were over-ruled by Charlene.  I had agreed 
with Jana that swapping the dates of the Analysts and Associates PRC meetings 
was a great solution.  Despite the fact that the program had not checked with 
us as PRC reps to see if December 13 was a convenient date, Charlene 
developed an interesting concern over potentially inconveniencing the 
directors who are PRC reps for the Analyst PRC.  And I see that you were 
drafted into facilitating the whole meeting!  

I am scheduled on the 5:35 flight from IAH to Las Vegas on the afternoon of 
the 13th.  I would have to leave downtown by 4:15 to make that flight.  I 
have been asked to confirm those flight arrangements so that a ticket can be 
issued.  Since you will be in charge, will this flight time work?  --Sally

Subject: Answer required in connection with FERC filings for Cinergy

Sam Behrends of LLGM needs to have an answer to the following question no 
later than the end of business today.  Please provide any information that 
you might have.

"Following the sale of the 2000 peakers to Allegheny and the two 99 peakers 
to Cinergy, how much generation will Enron still own within two wheels of 
TVA?"

I think that the answer is New Albany and Doyle (except that we only own 50% 
of Doyle and Doyle does not have any merchant capacity to sell (i.e. the 
facility is fully dedicated to Oglethorpe)).  I am not certain, however, that 
I have thought of everything and don't know the capacities for these two 
facilities.

Thanks in advance for your help.

Stuart

Dave, yes, I have upside on this week's East Midstream earnings.  Here's how 
it looks right now:

Great River Energy  $  875,000
Keyspan split              $4,000,000
Chicago Hub               $3,000,000
                                         ----------------
Total              $7,875,000


Yes, these earnings are real. GRE will be booked tomorrow (Ozzie is signing 
the contracts tonight), and Keyspan dollars will be finalized on Thursday. 
Chicago is really moving now. The Trunkline capacity is being executed today 
and tomorrow and will be booked tomorrow (@ $1,500,000 net to ENA), we traded 
out of 15 BCF of a storage hedge with the Utility and will recognize about 
$1,000,000 net to ENA tomorrow, and will take @ $500,000 to earnings from 
numerous other deals later this week. Let me know if you wish to discuss!!

feedback drafts for both Cary Carrabine and Russell Murrell (Needs

meet with Cary next week, and Laura will be meeting with Russell and I may 
end up meeting with Russell afterwards. 

We will have the final written feedback to Fran by end of next week, after 
the employee meetings. I hadn't planned for David Oxley to be in the meeting

Dave,

Some time back you should have received a voicemail from Paula Rieker 
regarding my seeking a meeting with you.  I was located in India at the time, 
and project Summer was on at the time.  Hence, after a couple of initial 
attempts, I decided to wait a while before I sought a meeting with you.

However, now with Project Summer behind us, I would like to meet with you to 
discuss potential opportunities in the North America Region.  I was part of 
the Associate pool at ECT, and have worked with Jim Fallon and Paula Rieker, 
among others.  I had then taken an assignment to work in India, and have been 
there for some years now.

I am in Houston for the rest of the week and will be seeking to get on your 
calender for a brief chat on opportunities in your group.

Regards,
Sandeep.

Ike, given our schedules, it appears that e-mail may be the most effective 
communication tool.  

I thought I would just follow up on progress being made in TVA on our 
settlement process.  As well, I understand that there has been a number of 
communications between TVA and Enron on the NoxTech emissions business.  I 
have encouraged the Enron folks to pursue this opportunity with TVA given the 
larger dialogue.  The Enron team has told me that TVA  wishes to move to firm 
pricing and a MOU on this technology.  Given the larger dialogue, I have 
suggested to our team to hold tight on completing the agreement until both 
TVA and Enron have a view on where the overall settlement discussions are 
going.  

Please give me a call at your earliest convenience.

Regards
Dave Delainey

Verified that one blade broke off from the 7th stage of blades in the 
compressor.  The shrapnel caused unreparable damage to 3 additional blades.  
From the pictures, it appears that one of the damaged blades was close to 
breaking off, and likely would have caused much more significant damage to 
the compressor AND turbine.

We've begun the process of removing the damaged blades.  Westinghouse has the 
repair lead, and so far, is giving it the right level of attention.  My plant 
manager's driving the effort on the ground, but I have a compressor engineer 
that will be at the site tomorrow to serve as my eyes and ears so Pete can 
concentrate on keeping the other two units running.

Barring as-yet undiscovered damage (doubtful), my best guess is that we lose 
next week, but get the unit back for the week of 24 July.  This hinges on 
Westinghouse securing four replacement blades which they are scrambling to 
do.  All costs should fall on Westinghouse warranty.

I'm collecting the information we might need in order to file a business 
process interruption insurance claim, but based on my best-guess schedule, I 
don't expect to file the claim.

Mitch

Dave, we have come up with a structure that creates approx a C$45MM tax loss 
to offset our year-end projected C$50MM Taxable Income position. By doing 
this, we avoid cutting the government a cheque for roughly C$20MM. It seems 
to me that we should be able to recognize that $20MM as gross margin. We are

Dave, I am going to send Shawn your way - he has extensive development, asset 
and project finance experience.  I would like him under your supervision to 
manage our coal power development strategy - like we discussed it could be a 
very robust strategy with multiple exit points.  I strongly believe that coal 
needs to come back into the stack and that the existing development teams 
(Parquet & Jacoby) are already buried under mid-stream gas development 
opportunities.

This would incorporate acquisitions, development, technology,  asset sales, 
emissions credits & technology, fuel supply and power sales.

Please update your 2001 budget to incorporate this new iniative.

Guys, I would like to add the following commentary to the DASH which will 
better reflect my thinking around this investment.  The current text suggests 
that there is significant strategic advantage for ENA to be a participant in 
the fund.  I do not think that is the case; however, I do see some merits in 
the investment based on the needs of Enron's Global Finance group.  I would 
suggest toning down the strategic advantages and add the following:

 It is unlikely that given the funds target returns that the it will be an 
effective permanent monetization vehicle for ENA's strategic and merchant   
investments; however, Enron Global Finance believes that the investment is 
important for the following reasons:
  a) provides an additional "Friend of Enron" to facilitate short to medium 
term balance sheet and regulatory solution to highly structured    commodity 
and capital transactions in the wholesale group;
  b) provides alternative sources of short term capital liquidity and
  c) by further developing the relationship with AIG provides collateral 
benefits for Enron's overall Global Finance capability and business.

ENA would have a requirement that this investments be hedged through Raptor 
and be managed by the Enron Global Finance Group.

the fullest extent possible with the investigating authorities, and we were 
confident that there was no substance to the allegations.  Accordingly, it is 
with great pleasure that I inform all of you that the Competition Bureau has 
announced in a press release, that the alleged offences under the Competition 
Act were unsubstantiated and that the Competition Bureau has closed the 
inquiry.  To quote the Competition Bureau, "The evidence suggests that the 
companies were employing independent business strategies and were not 
colluding on bids."  I want to thank everyone for their co-operation in 
dealing with this disruptive matter.

As a follow up to our conversations on the origination function within ENA, I 
was hoping that you could join us at our middle marketing team meeting on 
September 21 at 4:00 pm. I think it would be beneficial if you shared your 
views on origination currently and its role (s) in the future. This would 
also be an excellent forum for you to discuss ENA's short and long- term 
goals.

If this date is not amenable to you, please let me know when you would be 
available.

No doubt you will have heard of this initiative - a program of "surprise" 
quick controls reviews at various business units. 
There are two such reviews coming up in March in relation to EES (London and 
Houston), where I suspect the element of surprise would be outweighed by 
having some good early input to the scope.

Let me know your thoughts.

Randall, I appreciate the invite - I would like to continue to be involved.  
It was a pleasure to meet you and your team.

The several things on my radar screen with Bridgeline include:
 a) improving the financial performance of the entity;
 b) ensuring that the risk management and trading capability and structure 
matches ENA's technology, structure, systems, accountability and policies in 
every manner.  In my view, this is not a negotiable item and will only 
benefit Bridgeline on a go forward basis;
 c) continue to move from the "heavy lifting" approach to becoming the 
"smartest pipe" that can harness improved returns by capitalizing on your 
people, your information advantage and I believe somewhat of a first mover 
advantage given the continued consolidation of the intrastate competitors 
(ie) Entergy/Koch/FPL. We will be very supportive of innovative and 
aggressive positions that are well thought out and downsides defined; and
 d) increasing the underlying liquidity of our capital position in Bridgeline.

My time and resources are at your disposal.

As I mentioned to you earlier, there is much interest/concern about managing 
the ENE portfolio of turbines, both from a balance sheet and a deal

weeks including one today from RAC.

I thought you might be interested in the comment I have highlighted below, in

Subject: Re: Master Turbine Listing  

Thanks Mike - the effort underway (by RAC and EECC) is an overall Enron 
turbine effort, to which the LM6000's are a subset.  Rick Buy must report to 
Skilling and the board on the "long" turbine position....... thus the current 
effort.  RAC and EECC have initated a more formal process where RAC will be 
keeping a master list of turbines for Enron (like I am currently doing) with 
input from EECC.  Dan Shultz's team will be plugged into that effort so we 
don't have redundant list efforts going.  

Matt Gimble's list looks very detailed and specific to the LM6000 effort - I 
think some of his data will be benefitial to the Enron Master Turbine List.  
I will ask that Mat Tezyk and Rick Carson/RAC to coordinate.  

Additionally - I think Dan/Mat Tezyk have some turbine lists they are using 
to track manufacturing and QA checks........, I don't think those lists are 
intended to ever replace the Enron Master Turbine list.  

Finally - Larry Izzo asked that Dan put a list together regarding the 
LM6000's so that he (Izzo) could interface with ESA, ENA, and RAC.  I'm sure 
that Dan could use Matt Gimble's list, overlaying ESA's needs (if they were 
not listed).  

In summary - If we have redundant efforts going - help me highlight them so 
we can remove unneccessary work.  

Thanks for the note!  F.Kelly

The Master Turbine Listing contains the schedules that Tammy Shepperd and I

It includes an overal Turbine Inventory, Brian Hulse's LM6000 schedules and 
an LM6000 Timing page.
The LM6000 Configuration is Ben Jacoby's schedule.

As soon as Tammy and I set up the protection on the Master Turbine Schedule, 
I will send you its
location.

Thanks for all of your help and feedback,

Gavin -

The teams did an outstanding job getting the big issues wrapped up this 
weekend.  All units at all the 2000 peaker sites can now be dispatched 
commercially.  In Navy jargon, BZ!!

Though you and I will need to continue OEM discussions on commercial issues 
and punch list items, ENA now has 2920 Mw's of capacity available for 
dispatch.  This is a big milestone with significant value to Enron.

Please extend my appreciation to all concerned for the weekend wrap-up and 
the extended hours required to make it happen.

Currently, Enron has several contractual disputes with Siemens/Westinghouse.  
These include:  $5-10MM lingering from Marmara; about $4-5MM on Puerto Rico; 
and maybe $1-3MM on the Gleason and Indiana Peakers.

In my meeting with Randy Zwirn yesterday, Randy suggested that I meet with 
him in an attempt to come to a global settlement on all the Enron disputes.  

I propose to do this.  I understand the strength of the contractual issues on 
each of these projects and I think I can close out the issues by optimizing 
the Enron leverage in one global settlement.  The process will take from 
30-60 days as both sides collect all contractual arguments.

I'll keep ENA informed.

Let me know if either of you object to this global type approach.

I talked with the legal guys at Cinergy and after further discussions with

were two sticking points that I was trying to get them to backdown from: 1) a 
stand-still agreement and 2) a solicitation agreement.  They were not willing 
to back down from these, thus they concluded with suggesting no "CA".  Let me

I hate to make the management committee too big but how about Scott Tholen.  
He is very high quality.

Dave, Pope has been working with the Stampeder organization for the last six 
months on creating a sponsorship package for our Retail business. Our first 
goal was to attempt to get the naming rights to McMahon Stadium (not unlike 
the Canadian Airlines Saddledome, Enron Field, etc.). At this point the 
naming rights are off the table. However, we have the opportunity to grab the 
naming rights to the Labour Day Classic as well as some other season-long 
involvement. Terms of the deal at this point are as follows:

1. "Enron Labor day Classsic" and 100 thirty-second radio spots promoting the 
Enron Labor day Classic + Newspaper Ads
 40,000 Enron logo cheering towels to be distributed pre-game
 Exclusive sponsorship on the cover of the game day program
 Enron logo on the player's jerseys

2. Season long involvement 
 End-Zone advertising
 1 full-page color ad in the Stamp's 2001 yearbook
 12 season tickets
 12 red & white club memberships

Cost would be approx $100K Cdn (still be negotiated). 

In terms of our overall strategy for branding, this is likely the only 
initiative that we would pursue in 2001 as we like that it has good 
penetration for the entire province of Alberta as well as national exposure. 
The Labour day game draws the biggest crowd each season, has been sold out 
eight out the past nine seasons, and is the largest single day sporting event 
in Calgary each year. Last year the "battle of Alberta" attracted over 
750,000 viewers on CBC. The timing is also very good as we will be fully 
functional by September. 

Let me know what you think.

Regards
Milnthorp

Guys, given our continued need to be crisp and clear on our work product and a clear view to increasing efficiencies, particularily in the back and mid office, I think it would be a good exercise to clearly map out roles and responsibilities between ENW and the EES Services Group in some amount of detail.  Dan will take the lead in this activity.  I would hope that we could have this mapped out fairly quickly without a great deal of internal time.

Dave,
FYI, 
On Tuesday, I pulled the trigger on the VPP for Crescendo.  The total was 
just in excess of $8,000,000.  I have executed ISDA for the financial swaps 
and am awaiting final doc's for the Enfolio Master Agreement for execution.  
I have passed this on to Lavorato.  The transaction proceeded fairly 
smoothly.  I have met with John Arnold on the best means of working with his 
group.  He suggested that we continue to work through Fred.  Fred, John 
Prevatt, and Arnold were very helpful in enabling me to pull the trigger at 
the peak of the curve on Tuesday.  I am no longer "spec - ing" gas.  It was 
fun while it lasted.
I will keep you posted.
Scott

I'm having Mitch scrub the economics one more time.   In general, however, 
the capital expense is very hard to justify given the fact we ran only 200 
hours last year (1000 hour total permit) and the forward curve suggests we 
will run 300-400 hours per year.

Spending capital $'s for lower CO and NOx is hard to justify when the 
additional run hours are not valued from a trading perspective.

Live to fight another day - I don't know if you know but I settled with Fort 
James - we ripped up all three contracts for no money that netted us 
approximately $15M in value through the elimination of the two power 
contracts in the NW.  Wertz was on the other side.  Thought you might want to 
know.

Thanks
Delainey

Jeff, this fella gave me a call on a new technology that converts chemical 
feedstocks into industrial gases.  He wants to establish the technology in 
Baytown and is looking for our assistance and capital.  This is probably a 
stretch but it may be worthwhile for you to speak with him.  I am not 
advocating this play just passing on the message.

Steve Paras 718-630-5611

He will be in Houston on Friday.

Subject: Future GE forecast - John Schroeder

Need input if anyone thinks we need more turbines than John Schroeder/GE has 
forecasted.  My gut feel is that John has forecasted more turbines than we 
will need (which is OK).  

The GE planning Boys called John and asked him to check with Enron....... and 
determine if Enron wanted any turbines in the 2002/2003 timeframe (the 
previous assumption being 7F's wouldn't be available till 4Q03, and 7EA's 
wouldn't be available till 1Q03).  John stated that he didn't know what the 
request from Schenectady meant....., but....., maybe a few production slots 
were coming available as things shake out.....  John told them that he 
thought Enron might be interested in:

qty 4 7EA's and qty 4 7F's for ESA
qty 2 7EA's and qty 2 7F's for Mexico
qty 6 7EA's and qty 6 7F's for NA

John is asking us........, "that would be enough...... right?".  We don't 
need to change that input (from John Schroeder to Schenectady) if we want 
less than he forecasted, but....., if someone knows something I don't, 
and....., we would want more turbines than the above......., please let us 
know.  

On an immediate basis, John also stated that he had requests in for turbines 
for Saudi, and....., "an island project".  

Regards - F.Kelly

Beth, can you start putting together your presentation for the offsite.  You 
have approximately one hour.  Topic should focus on the 2001 ENA systems plan 
(ie) what are identified priorities, key maintenance, new iniatives and maybe 
your view of where we need to go in the future.  I would leave some time for 
questions.

The audience should come away from the meeting with a pretty good 
understanding of what is our systems agenda for ENA in 2001.

Could you have a first cut by December 8th?

Tammy Sheppard and Dorie Hitchcock can do some of the heavy lifting.
