A man boards an airplane and takes his seat. As he
settles in, he glances up and sees a very beautiful
woman boarding the plane.

He soon realizes she is heading straight towards
his seat. Lo and behold, she takes the seat right
beside his. Eager to strike up a conversation, he
blurts out "Business trip or vacation?"

She turns, smiles and says, "Business. I'm going to
the annual "Nymphomaniac Convention in Chicago."

He swallows hard. Here is the most gorgeous woman he
has ever seen sitting next to him and she's going to a
meeting for nymphomaniacs. Struggling to maintain his
composure, he calmly asks, "What's your business role
at this convention?"

"Lecturer", she says. "I use my experience to
debunk some of the popular myths about sexuality."

"Really", he says, "what myths are those?"

"Well", she explains, "one popular myth is that
African American men are the most well endowed when,
in fact, it's the Native American Indian who is most
likely to possess that trait.

Another popular myth is that French men are the best
lovers, when actually it is the men of Jewish descent.
However, we have found that the best potential lover
in all categories is the Southern Redneck."

Suddenly the woman becomes a little uncomfortable and
blushes.

"I'm sorry", she says. "I shouldn't be discussing
this with you.

I don't even know your name!"

"Tonto", the man says, "Tonto Goldstein. But my
friends call me Bubba."

Brothers,
?
Keep the messages coming.? Your messages are laugh out loud  funny.? My wife 
wishes she were a Beta and could get in on the fun  to.? For example, in 
response to our selection of Lakewood Landing for  Thursday night- Jim Dent 
writes:
?
Beek:
?
"I regret to inform you  that the Lakewood Landing is a gay bar. Looks like 
some of the brothers will  have to go in drag. Get it, Elvis."
?
Brother Del  Dent
?
I sent this message to Tom Benson and he  responded:
?
"No wonder everyone was so  friendly!? That explains the bathrooms being 
marked "shipping" and  "receiving" ." 

Tom 

Shortly thereafter, I get a message (Anderson, you're  gunna like this) from 
Bill Jansson:
"There is no problem so large,that it can not be overcome by  the use of
high-explosives." LTjg Bill Jansson,USN-1983
?
Bill also included the a photograph. (see  attached).
?
Another source of great entertainment was the copy from  the SMU Alumni 
On-line Newsletter that John Miller circulated.? I couldn't  help suspecting 
the influence of the Drow factor.? I hope the responsible  party will humbly 
step forward and receive the clicks due him for such a  creative and humorous 
piece of writing that captured the essence of a 'Gamma  Omega' Beta. 
?
Many clicks,
BEEK

GE has informed us during the Arcos discussion that GE senior management has 
directed that the GE deal team cannot agree to allowing GE indemnity 
obligations related with government fines for failure to comply with law to 
be exclude from the limit of liability.  


This needs to be added to Pete T's World Hunger Punchlist of issues.

Enron Arcos deal team has not agreed to GE's position.

It took place.  We made some progress in indemnity and LOL.  The carve outs 
from the LOL remain an open issue.

We had some helpful discussion about assignment, but I'm not sure how much 
progress was made.  

You were assigned NO tasks this week!

Body:
I was unaware that this was on the table for discussion in World Hunger. 

My recollection is that Mike Barnas proposed the changes to 20.2 (b), which 
addresses indemnity for fines and penalties (who can forget the cognizant 
government?).  We agreed to narrow GE's exposure by specifically relating the 
indemnity obligation to a violation of section 3.8, as opposed to the broader 
provision in prior contracts.

Subject: Re: Arcos- World Hunger- LOL fines carve out.  

Steve knows I am pissed about this and in our Arcos meeting I brought up the 
same point raised by Kay below.  Steve claims that the no cap on gov. 
violations was rejected some time ago by GE mana. when Barnas presented to 
them an update of the "end world hunger".  Steve also thinks that they had 
told us previously about this change.  ( Is this true???)  I told him it was 
news to me and that I would have thought that if true, then GE would have (a) 
highlighted the changes on the draft contract and/or (b) added it to the list 
of outstanding issues.

When asked to explain the rationale for changing their position on this 
issue, Steve was unable to give an answer other than to say GE mana. had said 
that they needed to cap their liability at the contract price for gov. 
violations although they thought GE could live with no cap on FCPA violations.

it was subject to lots of give and take.

GE has informed us during the Arcos discussion that GE senior management has 
directed that the GE deal team cannot agree to allowing GE indemnity 
obligations related with government fines for failure to comply with law to 
be exclude from the limit of liability.  


This needs to be added to Pete T's World Hunger Punchlist of issues.

Enron Arcos deal team has not agreed to GE's position.

This is the last email I have on the issue of consequentials/LOL.  As I 
recall, we have not agreed to the redaction of the carve out of the LOL for 
gross negligence, but it is an important issue for GE.  

Steve Swift wants to close out these issues.  Are we ready, or do we need 
this for a swap for something?

Folks,

Here is some language for discussion this afternoon.  Please note that this
is being submitted for discussion without full management approval; we're
getting so close to the bone that we'll probably need to take the final
package as a whole through our vetting process

I'm looking through the warranty section now, so perhaps we can discuss that
as well.

Ciao,

Here's my suggestion:

27.3   Consequential Losses.  The Parties have agreed to liquidate certain 
direct damages and have provided for these damages as Liquidated Damages and 
Cancellation Fees.  For purposes of this Section, Liquidated Damages and 
Cancellation Fees shall not be deemed consequential losses.  In no event, 
whether as a result of breach of contract, breach of warranty, indemnity, 
tort liability (including negligence or strict liability without regard to 
fault) or otherwise, and whether arising before or after completion of the 
Scope of Work, shall either Party be liable to the other Party for special, 
indirect, exemplary or consequential losses of any nature whatsoever, 
including losses or damages caused by reason of unavailability of the 
Equipment, shutdowns or service interruptions, loss of use, loss of profits 
or revenue, inventory or use charges, cost of purchased or replacement power, 
interest charges or cost of capital or claims of a Party,s customers.  For 
the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing limitation of liability in this Section 
shall in no case not limit Seller,s obligation to indemnify, defend and hold 
harmless Purchaser Indemnified Parties in accordance with Article XX for any 
claims Third Party Claim, including Claims involving the Third Party's 
consequential losses, losses or damages occasioned by third parties. in

Subject: GE - Indemnity and LOL Language

Per our discussion yesterday, attached is a copy of the Indemnity and LOL 
contract language redlined to reflect those GE comments which we could 
probably accept.  Kay please review and see if I missed anything or whether 
we need to discuss further.  Otherwise, please forward this markup to Rob 
Taylor for inclusion in the next draft of the Purchase Agreement.

Regards,

Scott

NEPCO's position sounds more typical for a cost plus contract.  Is this a 
lump sum deal? If so, then I think NEPCO is taking an aggressive approach to 
both LOL and retention.  A 10% limit of liability during the warranty period 
is particularly aggressive, unless there are a lot of carve outs to the limit 
of liability, and other give-and-takes which make it make sense. Another 
factor which might make a difference is the treatment given to the GE 
contract.  Is NEPCO taking risk on GE performance, and is the dollar value of 
the GE equipment included in the price used to figure the % of liability?

I'm glad to discuss this if I can be of help.

Kay

Subject: EPC Limits of Liability

Kay - Ron Coker in the CTG group suggested you might be able to help with 
this.

ENA/SF is in the middle of negotiating the EPC contract for Pastoria (750 MW) 
with NEPCO.  We have hit a couple of snags in the contract and would very 
much appreciate your input as to what is "market." 

1. Limit of Liability -  NEPCO would like 80% up to Substantial Completion, 
40% up to Final Acceptance, and 10% for the Warranty Period.  GE's LOL is 
100% of their contract value though the warranty period. (which Kiewit also 
agreed to on Pittsburg.)
2. Retention - NEPCO would like to have 10% retention on payments only for 
the first 5% on the contract value and then 5% retention thereafter.  We 
would prefer 10% throughout the payment schedule.

What do you think?  We want the Owner's position to be as strong as possible 
to enhance the sale of the project, but NEPCO is under a great amount of 
pressure to reduce their contingent liability, and we really don't want to 
leave them holding the bag once we are gone if it is not necessary.  

Regards, Dean

Attached is the latest markup on the warranty language which GE is now 
reviewing.  I also have a few comments from John Rigby which may be worth 
adding but I suggest we hold off until we discuss the warranty language with 
GE next week.

I also spoke to Steve Swift who indicated that he would Email to Sheila what 
has been agreed to on indemnity, LOL, ect. and what we intend to insert into 
the Arcos contract.  FYI I do not intend to use the "end world hunger" 
warranty language in the Arcos contract as I want GE back-to-back on what we 
have signed up to with the owner under the EPC contract.

Scott

Folks, I need your help:

Fast approaching is Sue Mara's next birthday.  She has made it 
verrrrrrrrrrrry clear to me (ahem) that she does not want a lot of attention 
or fuss; however, I do think it would be nice if she received a card with 
lots of signatures and well wishes!

Therefore, this is what I propose:  In order to be as discreet and "secret" 
as possible, *please* send your birthday wishes to her to my attention via 
this e-mail address and I will then print out each person's missive and 
enclose it with a card.

If you are interested in submitting something to me on Sue's behalf, PLEASE 
get it to me by THURSDAY, April 15th!!! [just think tax time, LOL!]

Again, please submit via this e-mail only to:  joseph.alamo@enron.com

THANKS SO MUCH in advance for your participation!

I'm still not wild about 27.5, which says they have no liability for any 
advice they give us which is not required by the agreement.  It seems that we 
could get into an argument about causation of a problem, and what was in/out 
of their scope under the agreement.  

I don't know that I have any brilliant ideas about how to narrow this carve 
out. I guess we could say no liability so long as the advice is clearly 
outside the scope of work, and is given in good faith and in accordance with 
industry standards.

Attached is the latest markup on the warranty language which GE is now 
reviewing.  I also have a few comments from John Rigby which may be worth 
adding but I suggest we hold off until we discuss the warranty language with 
GE next week.

I also spoke to Steve Swift who indicated that he would Email to Sheila what 
has been agreed to on indemnity, LOL, ect. and what we intend to insert into 
the Arcos contract.  FYI I do not intend to use the "end world hunger" 
warranty language in the Arcos contract as I want GE back-to-back on what we 
have signed up to with the owner under the EPC contract.

Scott

Subject:  Re: GE Language  (Document link: Scott Dieball)

 I think that I agree with the points and comments you folks raised in the
first echange on indemnities below, but don't have the document to refer
to. Scott, please drop by and brief me on these.  Cognizant Gov't? Never
heard of  the term, and itis not one of the usual defined terms. Don't know
how it's used here, suggest you decline andmake them clarify.

LOL ISSUES:
1. I suppose that this is a NY law contract. I  do not think you can
effectively limit your liability for gross negligence or wilful misconduct
in NY. Regardless of choice of law, we generally cannot get this limited
or excluded in contracts with owners, either.  I think you should not
accept any GE attempt to limit this by means of the cap on liability or
otherwise , and should avoid muddying the water on the point by taking any
"to the fullest extent permitted by law" clause or other  such stuff as a
compromise. It will be important every time we wrap the GE equipment.

2. Generally, I do not think they should be able to limit their indemnity
for Haz Mat, patents, etc.

3. They have consistently refused to clarify that the indemnity  for all
third party losses includes third party consequentials when Brian or
whoever else over here has been the lead negotiator with GE in the past. I
would like to think that we could get it clarified now that the larger
Enron is working it.  Please try it again if you can.

Subject:  GE Language

I'm not particularly wild about many of the changes proposed by GE.  Agree.
Seems that it would be a good idea to get a consensus on how to respond.
Here are the issues I see:

Indemnity issues:
They should indemnify us from claims by their employees/subcontractors.
Kay - Is your comment in connection with GE's comment to Section 27.1(iii)
(carve out of the 100% LOL for "gross acts" of its subcontractors, vendors,
ect.)?  GE is in an aggressive outsource mode and needs to remain solely
and totally responsible for the actions and liabilities for its
subcontractors and vendors.  I think Section 20.2(a) as written covers
simple negligence of GE's subcontractors and vendors and I would argue that
we need to keep Section 27.1(iii) as written dealing with gross negligence
of GE's subcontractors and vendors.
Indemnity should be triggered by strict liability as well as negligence.
Agree - Maybe we could agree to GE's strike out in 20.2(a) provided the
phrase "negligent or willfully wrongful" is replaced with "negligent, at
fault or strictly liable without fault" (or some variation thereof).
What is a cognizant government?  Don't know!  This was not discussed with
MIke so I am not sure what is the meaning of adding this term.  We need to
also think in terms of how we could be harmed in a situation where GE fails
to comply with law, and instead of Enron incurring a monetary penalty, is
ordered to shut down the facility.

Limit of liability issues:
They want to limit their indemnity obligations for complying with laws,
patent infringement, liability for haz. waste and liens to 100% of purchase
price.
They want the limit of liability to apply to gross negligence, if possible.
Agree - See 1st comment above re indemnity.
They don't want to clarify that they have to indemnify us for another
party's claim for consequentials (as in a personal injury claim).  Agree.

We've don't have anything concrete on assignment yet.  Agree.

Comments?  I suggest we get together before our next scheduled conf. call
to discuss our game plan.

Sheila has asked that we change Wednesday's call to 1100 Central, or 100
Central if 1100 doesn't work.  Is this a problem?  Works for me...just let
me know when, where, ect.

Kay


They should have to

How Old Are You, Grandpa?


One evening a grandson was talking to his grandfather about current

events.


He asked what he thought about the shootings at schools, the computer

age, and just things in general.


The granddad replied, "Well, let me think a minute ... I was born

before television, penicillin, polio shots, frozen foods, Xerox,

contact lenses, Frisbees and the pill.


There was no radar, credit cards, laser beams or ball-point pens. Man

had not invented pantyhose, air conditioners, dishwashers, clothes dryers,

well the clothes were hung out to dry in

the fresh air and man hadn't yet walked on the moon.


Your grandmother and I got married first, and then lived together.

Every family had a father and a mother, and every boy over

14 had a rifle that his dad taught him how to use and respect. And

they went hunting and fishing together. Until I was 25, I

called every man older than I, 'Sir'-and after I turned 25, I still

called policemen and every man with a title, 'Sir.' Sundays were

set aside for going to church as a family, helping those in need, and

visiting with family or neighbors.


We were before gay-rights, computer-dating, dual careers, daycare

centers, and group therapy.


Our lives were governed by the Ten Commandments, good judgment, and

common sense. We were taught to know the

difference between right and wrong and to stand up and take

responsibility for our actions.


Serving your country was a privilege; living here was a bigger

privilege.


We thought fast food was what people ate during Lent. Having a

meaningful relationship meant getting along with your

cousins.


Draft dodgers were people who closed their front doors when the

evening breeze started.


Time-sharing meant time the family spent together in the evenings and

weekends-not purchasing condominiums.


We never heard of FM radios, tape decks, CDs, electric typewriters,

yogurt, or guys wearing earrings. We listened to the Big

Bands, Jack Benny, and the President's speeches on our radios. And I

don't ever remember any kid blowing his brains out

listening to Tommy Dorsey.


If you saw anything with 'Made in Japan' on it, it was junk.


The term 'making out' referred to how you did on your school exam.


Pizza Hut, McDonald's, and instant coffee were unheard of. We had 5 &


10-cent stores where you could actually buy things for 5 and 10 cents.


Ice cream cones, phone calls, rides on a streetcar, and a Pepsi were

all a nickel. And if you didn't want to splurge, you could spend your nickel

on enough stamps to mail 1 letter and 2 postcards.


You could buy a new Chevy Coupe for $600, but who could afford one?

Too bad, because gas was 11 cents a gallon.


In my day, 'grass' was mowed, 'coke' was a cold drink, 'pot' was

something your mother cooked in, and 'rock music' was your

grandmother's lullaby.


'Aids' were helpers in the Principal's office, 'chip' meant a piece

of wood, 'hardware' was found in a hardware store, and

'software' wasn't even a word.


And we were the last generation to actually believe that a lady

needed a husband to have a baby.


No wonder people call us "old and confused" and say there is a

generation gap and how old do you think I am - ????


...... This man would be only 59 years old.

Seems that it would be a good idea to get a consensus on how to respond.  
Here are the issues I see:

Indemnity issues:
They should indemnify us from claims by their employees/subcontractors.  Kay 
- Is your comment in connection with GE's comment to Section 27.1(iii) (carve 
out of the 100% LOL for "gross acts" of its subcontractors, vendors, ect.)?  
GE is in an aggressive outsource mode and needs to remain solely and totally 
responsible for the actions and liabilities for its subcontractors and 
vendors.  I think Section 20.2(a) as written covers simple negligence of GE's 
subcontractors and vendors and I would argue that we need to keep Section 
27.1(iii) as written dealing with gross negligence of GE's subcontractors and 
vendors. 
Indemnity should be triggered by strict liability as well as negligence.  
Agree - Maybe we could agree to GE's strike out in 20.2(a) provided the 
phrase "negligent or willfully wrongful" is replaced with "negligent, at 
fault or strictly liable without fault" (or some variation thereof).
What is a cognizant government?  Don't know!  This was not discussed with 
MIke so I am not sure what is the meaning of adding this term.  We need to 
also think in terms of how we could be harmed in a situation where GE fails 
to comply with law, and instead of Enron incurring a monetary penalty, is 
ordered to shut down the facility.

Limit of liability issues:
They want to limit their indemnity obligations for complying with laws, 
patent infringement, liability for haz. waste and liens to 100% of purchase 
price.  
They want the limit of liability to apply to gross negligence, if possible.  
Agree - See 1st comment above re indemnity. 
They don't want to clarify that they have to indemnify us for another party's 
claim for consequentials (as in a personal injury claim).  Agree.

We've don't have anything concrete on assignment yet.  Agree.

Comments?  I suggest we get together before our next scheduled conf. call to 
discuss our game plan.

Sheila has asked that we change Wednesday's call to 1100 Central, or 100 
Central if 1100 doesn't work.  Is this a problem?  Works for me...just let me 
know when, where, ect.

Folks,

Having conferred at last with my colleagues, I can now forward to you our
draft language for the Indemnity and LOL clauses.  As Steve mentioned in his
earlier message, he has suggested some issues to discuss which could bring
us closer to resolution on that issue.  Please let me know if you have any
question!

 I think that I agree with the points and comments you folks raised in the
first echange on indemnities below, but don't have the document to refer
to. Scott, please drop by and brief me on these.  Cognizant Gov't? Never
heard of  the term, and itis not one of the usual defined terms. Don't know
how it's used here, suggest you decline andmake them clarify.

LOL ISSUES:
1. I suppose that this is a NY law contract. I  do not think you can
effectively limit your liability for gross negligence or wilful misconduct
in NY. Regardless of choice of law, we generally cannot get this limited
or excluded in contracts with owners, either.  I think you should not
accept any GE attempt to limit this by means of the cap on liability or
otherwise , and should avoid muddying the water on the point by taking any
"to the fullest extent permitted by law" clause or other  such stuff as a
compromise. It will be important every time we wrap the GE equipment.

2. Generally, I do not think they should be able to limit their indemnity
for Haz Mat, patents, etc.

3. They have consistently refused to clarify that the indemnity  for all
third party losses includes third party consequentials when Brian or
whoever else over here has been the lead negotiator with GE in the past. I
would like to think that we could get it clarified now that the larger
Enron is working it.  Please try it again if you can.

Subject:  GE Language

I'm not particularly wild about many of the changes proposed by GE.  Agree.
Seems that it would be a good idea to get a consensus on how to respond.
Here are the issues I see:

Indemnity issues:
They should indemnify us from claims by their employees/subcontractors.
Kay - Is your comment in connection with GE's comment to Section 27.1(iii)
(carve out of the 100% LOL for "gross acts" of its subcontractors, vendors,
ect.)?  GE is in an aggressive outsource mode and needs to remain solely
and totally responsible for the actions and liabilities for its
subcontractors and vendors.  I think Section 20.2(a) as written covers
simple negligence of GE's subcontractors and vendors and I would argue that
we need to keep Section 27.1(iii) as written dealing with gross negligence
of GE's subcontractors and vendors.
Indemnity should be triggered by strict liability as well as negligence.
Agree - Maybe we could agree to GE's strike out in 20.2(a) provided the
phrase "negligent or willfully wrongful" is replaced with "negligent, at
fault or strictly liable without fault" (or some variation thereof).
What is a cognizant government?  Don't know!  This was not discussed with
MIke so I am not sure what is the meaning of adding this term.  We need to
also think in terms of how we could be harmed in a situation where GE fails
to comply with law, and instead of Enron incurring a monetary penalty, is
ordered to shut down the facility.

Limit of liability issues:
They want to limit their indemnity obligations for complying with laws,
patent infringement, liability for haz. waste and liens to 100% of purchase
price.
They want the limit of liability to apply to gross negligence, if possible.
Agree - See 1st comment above re indemnity.
They don't want to clarify that they have to indemnify us for another
party's claim for consequentials (as in a personal injury claim).  Agree.

We've don't have anything concrete on assignment yet.  Agree.

Comments?  I suggest we get together before our next scheduled conf. call
to discuss our game plan.

Sheila has asked that we change Wednesday's call to 1100 Central, or 100
Central if 1100 doesn't work.  Is this a problem?  Works for me...just let
me know when, where, ect.

Kay

Subject: Re: EPC Limits of Liability  

Hi Kay.  Thanks for this input.  My somewhat knee-jerk reaction has been that 
NEPCo is, indeed, taking a very aggressive approach.  We are also hearing 
that they are under some sort of "mandate" to include these provisions in 
their contracts on a going forward basis (I think I might have some idea of 
what that's about), but we are obviously concerned that it won't fly with a 
third party buyer of our project.  Dean, Jim Fowler (our outside counsel at 
McCutchen) and I may want to chat about it with you further.

On a related note, I keep running into the need to have a more basic 
understanding of the West LB documents and the GE LM-6000 contract than I 
have.  Do you have copies of those documents, and could I ask you to have 
copies made and sent to me?  Much appreciated.

Hope all is well,
Karen

Subject: Re: EPC Limits of Liability  

NEPCO's position sounds more typical for a cost plus contract.  Is this a 
lump sum deal? If so, then I think NEPCO is taking an aggressive approach to 
both LOL and retention.  A 10% limit of liability during the warranty period 
is particularly aggressive, unless there are a lot of carve outs to the limit 
of liability, and other give-and-takes which make it make sense. Another 
factor which might make a difference is the treatment given to the GE 
contract.  Is NEPCO taking risk on GE performance, and is the dollar value of 
the GE equipment included in the price used to figure the % of liability?

I'm glad to discuss this if I can be of help.

Kay

Subject: EPC Limits of Liability

Kay - Ron Coker in the CTG group suggested you might be able to help with 
this.

ENA/SF is in the middle of negotiating the EPC contract for Pastoria (750 MW) 
with NEPCO.  We have hit a couple of snags in the contract and would very 
much appreciate your input as to what is "market." 

1. Limit of Liability -  NEPCO would like 80% up to Substantial Completion, 
40% up to Final Acceptance, and 10% for the Warranty Period.  GE's LOL is 
100% of their contract value though the warranty period. (which Kiewit also 
agreed to on Pittsburg.)
2. Retention - NEPCO would like to have 10% retention on payments only for 
the first 5% on the contract value and then 5% retention thereafter.  We 
would prefer 10% throughout the payment schedule.

What do you think?  We want the Owner's position to be as strong as possible 
to enhance the sale of the project, but NEPCO is under a great amount of 
pressure to reduce their contingent liability, and we really don't want to 
leave them holding the bag once we are gone if it is not necessary.  

Regards, Dean

Kay - Ron Coker in the CTG group suggested you might be able to help with 
this.

ENA/SF is in the middle of negotiating the EPC contract for Pastoria (750 MW) 
with NEPCO.  We have hit a couple of snags in the contract and would very 
much appreciate your input as to what is "market." 

1. Limit of Liability -  NEPCO would like 80% up to Substantial Completion, 
40% up to Final Acceptance, and 10% for the Warranty Period.  GE's LOL is 
100% of their contract value though the warranty period. (which Kiewit also 
agreed to on Pittsburg.)
2. Retention - NEPCO would like to have 10% retention on payments only for 
the first 5% on the contract value and then 5% retention thereafter.  We 
would prefer 10% throughout the payment schedule.

What do you think?  We want the Owner's position to be as strong as possible 
to enhance the sale of the project, but NEPCO is under a great amount of 
pressure to reduce their contingent liability, and we really don't want to 
leave them holding the bag once we are gone if it is not necessary.  

Regards, Dean

Hello Everyone

Yet another week is drawing to a close. I am very excited
about this weekend. Saturday my older brother is graduating
from college with a Bachelor's Degree in Psychology. He has
worked very hard for this and I am very proud of him. Also,
with Sunday being Mother's Day, we are going to have a cook
out at my boyfriend's uncle's house to celebrate. It should
be a lot of fun. I would like to wish all of you mothers
out there a wonderful day and to let you know how much I
respect you for the awesome jobs you are doing raising your
families. I hope that one day I can be a part of such an
elite and incredible group of individuals. :)

Keep those brain waves churning!

Janie

Hi Jane,

You were right, I just had to prove Lateral Larry wrong.  I
immediately thought of tSUNami as a correct answer also (the
Christian holiday reference was supposed to be a hint for
the "only one logical solution" and not meant to additionally
limit the answers).  I figured there must be others too, and
did a quick search.  There are at least  190 more "correct
answers".  Some of them are:

sunup, suntan, (all other sun... compound words too), sunnah,
sunn, sunk, Velsuna, Utsunomiya, sung, sunder, sundae, misun-
derstood, Asuncion, asunder, bosun, disunion, gesundheit,

Keep up the good work Jane!  Also, I'm still waiting on your
reply to my proposal (since your boyfriend hasn't proposed yet,
what are you waiting for????  LOL).

Guy
[I will give him the benefit of the doubt for now, but I
will let you know if anything happens. lol Thanks for the
info, I knew you guys would not let me down. :)]

                            ****

It is interesting that suede is spelled with a "w" instead
of a "u" in the States.  I have never seen it spelled that
way before, so I guess it must be a regional (albeit country
wide) thing, like how you Americans misspell neighboUr,
tomatoE, potatoE, coloUr, etc (LOL).   Seriously, though, I
thought it was a typo because that is not how it is spelled
in countries outside of the US (like so many other words,
including the above examples).  Because I thought it was a
typo, I just spelled it "correctly" mentally, and so was
unable to solve the puzzle (not like I'd have solved it had
I known though).  Have a good day and keep up with the good
work that you do.

Darlene
["The Mammoth Puzzle Carnival" was actually published in
England so forgive me for the foreign spellings. It is
getting harder and harder to find original material to
baffle and bamboozle all of you. But I will keep trying.]

                            ****

Janie,

Keep dreaming ... that's what it's all about ...

and ... the lottery is only the little picture!

All the best,
KAD
[And the best to you as well. As in the moral words
of Casey Kasem, "Keep your feet in the ground and keep
reaching for the stars."]

                            ****

For Leland re: Jane Barbe and the time announcements.

Am sure the tape (or whatever) was not made in one sitting.
Her male predecessor recorded, took a break, recorded some
more, until the entire twelve hours was on tape, then the
tape was electronically edited to synchronize it with the
atomic clock. Regardless, she IS good at what she does!!
Lloyd
[Thanks Lloyd, I am sure you are right and that tape was not
made in one sitting. And she is great at what she does, just
like I am sure all of you are great at what you do! :)]

[And thank you all for writing in. I hope to hear more from
all of you in the future! :)]

I'm sorry to clog up your email in boxes, but I found the attached to be 
pretty interesting.  However, some nagging questions remain:  Who are the

Subject: Pfthhhhhhhh Football


 
An old man and his wife have gone to bed. After laying there a few minutes
the old man farts and says, "Seven Points."
 
His wife rolls over and says, "What in the world was that?"
 
The old man replied, "It's fart football."
 
A few minutes later the wife lets one go and says, "Touchdown, tie score."
 
After about five minutes the old man farts again and says, "Touchdown, I'm
ahead 14 to 7."
 
Not to be out done the wife rips another one and says, "Touchdown, tie
score."
 
Five seconds go by and she lets out a squeaker and says, "Field goal, I lead
17 to 14."
 
Now the pressure's on and the old man refuses to get beat by his wife so he
strains real hard but to no avail. Realizing a defeat is totally
unacceptable, he gives it everything he has, but instead of farting, he poops
the bed.
 
The wife looks at him and says, "What the hell was that?"
 
And the old man replied, "Half-time, Switch sides."

Please respond to rkhansenWhat a pleasant surprise to hear from you.  I can understand your problem
with your mother.  My father has been hospitalized four times in the past 7
weeks or so.  He has congestive heart failure and he has to go to the
emergency room, be admitted, gets better, gets out and then crashes again.
He has been out now for almost 2 weeks this time and is doing better for
now.  My mother, who has no short term memory, is a another source of
constant concern.  I have them living at the Belmont on Holcombe.  They seem
to be doing okay there and making some effort to adjust to living with a
"bunch of old people" as my mother says.  She is 88 and is older than most
there.  Go figure.  She says, "but I can walk" so that is the difference to
her.

I am sorry you are going through the same thing.  It is so hard to deal with
everyday.  Not to mention when the phone rings late at night.  It has
happened so often to me that I just get up and assume it will be another run
to the emergency room.

It makes you want to drink margaritas and live life as hard as you can
because life is short then it gets to long.  If you know what I mean.

Law stuff is busy.  I lost the DeBakey case.  No surprise there but we had
some fun and made the old guy show up for trial.  Wish he had stayed home!
Lol

Anyway, it was good to hear from you.  Don't be such an email stranger. It
is always good to chat with you.

Take care,

RK

Sorry it has taken me so long to write back, I had a minor emergency in the

It was good to see you the other night.  What have you been up to?  Any

any trials, any golf?

Well, they say you'll never live if you never take a chance -

Click the following link to view the sender's profile:
http://www.match.com/doubleblind/showprofile.asp?UserID=444947474A4C4A&trackingid=0

The following is my profile text:

OK - let's cover the basics in the right order: Am I physically attractive and sensual? Oh, yes. Is it all of who I am? Oh, no! I am an intelligent, authentic, generous, honest woman who's ready to start meeting new people again.... I like all the regular stuff (movies, theatre, travel, etc) and LOVE music, wine and great friends. I value sincerity, dependability, enlightened minds, and those interested in learning something new everyday, including new insights about themselves. I am fun, witty, and willing to try anything once. "You shine brightly" in the recent words of a friend. I try very hard to stay grounded in the present, as opposed to dwelling on the past or worrying needlessly about the future. I believe that's "life's too short" and "everything happens for a reason." On one hand, I've recently begun amassing a small body of knowledge about wine, but on the other hand, I can enjoy playing some flag football or just grabbing some take-out and renting a video. I have my kids 50% of the time and when I do, they are my priority. My schedule is flexible, however, and when I'm free, I like to stay busy, being with friends, meeting new people and trying new things. Honestly, I think you'll find me to be a pleasant breath of fresh air in a world of mediocrity and uncertainty. (I dare you!.....lol)

I just wanted to say hello and wish you a great day!

 I have this feeling that you will  want to apologize for not being able to
call me this evening.   Don't even mention it, ok?  You have nothing to
worry about with me.   I  want to let you know that I am thinking about
you(always) , and that is why I decided to take a little break from my
studying to write you.  I cannot wait until the next time we are able to
spend time on our own.   I had such a wonderful time talking to you on
Friday.  I did not want it to end, and it made me sad to see you go.  A
phone call from you, however, put a smile right back on my face.

 I want to know everything about you John.  What makes you happy?  What
makes you laugh? What makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside?  What is your
most memorable  moment? What mischief did you and your siblings get into
when you were little? Did you have a  nickname as a child?  Did you ever
have a favorite Aunt or Uncle that would always take you to fun places?
What  were you like as a teenager? May I see a picture of you as a teenager,
lol - I am sure you were just as handsome then as you are now.  Did you have
the same beautiful red hair that you have now?  (Can I run my fingers
through it? j/k - ok, maybe I am not kidding)  I want to know where you
would like to see yourself in 10 years?  Do you believe everyone has a
soulmate?  Have you or do you ever want to give yourself completely to
someone - your heart, your soul? Do you ever want to see "little Johns and
little Janes"  running around? What do you like most about yourself? Do you
have a best friend you know you can count on? What are some of the places
you want to travel to?

 I want to know all of these things and more.   So lets enjoy these few, but
special moments that we already and can continue to  share.  Whether it be a
little smile from across the room, or just a simple hello.   I have all of
the time in the world.   I am not going anywhere.  I will always be right
here.  Close by.

I guess I will end this here - sorry if it was a little long, and sorry if I
"babbled" away - I agree that we females tend to do that sometimes.

I realize it will be Monday morning when you read this and I know it will
probably be a pretty busy morning for you, and me.  I am going back to my
studying now.  I am sure I will be up late again, as usual.

 I can't wait to see you in the morning!   Talk to you soon...

LOL.............how in the world did you find that.


Here's some funny Santa letters

Dear Santa,
I wud like a kool toy space ranjur fer xmas. Iv ben a gud boy all
yeer.
Yer Frend,
BiLLy

Dear Billy,
Nice spelling.  You're on your way to a career in lawn care.  How
about I send you a fucking book so you can learn to read and write?  I'm
giving your older brother the space ranger.  At least HE can spell!
Santa

Dear Santa,
I have been a good girl all year, and the only thing I ask for is
peace and joy in the world for everybody!
Love,
Sarah

Dear Sarah,
You're parents smoked pot when they had you, didn't they?
Santa

Dear Santa,
I don't know if you can do this, but for Christmas, I'd like for my
mommy and daddy to get back together.  Please see what
you can do.
Love,
Teddy

Dear Teddy,
Look, your dad's banging the babysitter like a screen door in a
hurricane. you think he's gonna give that up to come back
to your frigid mom, who rides his ass constantly?  It's time to give up that
dream.  Let me get you some nice Legos instead.
Santa

Dear Santa,
I want a new bike, a Playstation, a train, some G.I. Joes, a dog, a
drum kit, a pony and a tuba.
Love
Francis

Dear Francis,
Who names their kid "Francis" nowadays?  I bet you're gay.
Santa

Dear Santa,
I left milk and cookies for you under the tree, and I left carrots for
your reindeer outside the back door.
Love,
Susan

Dear Susan,
Milk gives me the runs and carrots make the deer fart in my face when
riding in the sleigh.  You want to do me a favor? Leave me a bottle of
scotch.
Santa

Dear Santa,
What do you do the other 364 days of the year?  Are you busy making
toys?
Your friend,
Thomas

Dear Thomas,
All the toys are made in China.  I have a condo in Vegas, where I
spend most of my time making low-budget porno films.  I unwind by drinking
myself silly and squeezing the asses of cocktail waitresses
while losing money at the craps table.  Hey, you wanted to know.
Santa

Dear Santa,
Do you see us when we're sleeping, do you really know when we're
awake, like in the song?
Love,
Jessica

Dear Jessica,
Are you really that gullible?  Good luck in whatever you do.  I'm skipping
your house.
Santa

Dear Santa,
I really really want a puppy this year. Please please please PLEASE
PLEASE could I have one?
Timmy

Dear Timmy,
That whiney begging shit may work with your folks, but that crap
doesn't work with me.  You're getting a sweater again.
Santa

Dearest Santa,
We don't have a chimney in our house, how do you get into our home?
Love
Marky

Mark,
First, stop calling yourself "Marky", that's why you're getting your ass
kicked at school.  Second, you don't live in a house, you live in a
low-rent apartment complex.  Third, I get inside your pad just like all the
burglars do, through your bedroom window.
Sweet dreams,
Santa

Subject: Draft GE Turbine Agreement Comments

Sheila,
I have reviewed the template GE turbine contract you sent last week from A&K 
as an initial draft for our review.

1. If this is the template, I would like to understand how the "ENA as agent 
for E-Next" language is going to be inserted and what exactly the language 
will say.  With respect to the Agreement in Principle for the turbine for the 
Longview project, the contract states that this template along with Pastoria 
Assignment and Assumption language and override letters will be the basis for 
the final turbine purchase agreeement.  Given that the Pastoria turbine 
contracts had the financing vehicle on the contract as purchaser, with ENA as 
its agent, I'm unclear how the circulated template contract is supposed to 
read for the Longview project and every other turbine purchase contract which 
is being financed by E-Next Generation LLC.

I have noted in the template contract sections which need to be "agentized", 
including the preamble where the question is asked if ENA will always be the 
purchaser - no is the answer for Longview and probably most of the contracts 
ENA wants to enter into with GE.  I will not make those comments here until I 
receive your response to the above.

2. First Recital:  Given that the Facility is defined for a specific project, 
I didn't read anywhere that ENA has the flexibility to use this turbine in 
other projects if it so chooses.  Please advise where I can find this 
flexibility to change venue language.

3. Second Recital:  Where is "GTG" defined?

4. "Owner":  Will this definition always be required that it's not in 
brackets, i.e., that Purchaser and Owner are different parties?

5. Please change definition positions for 1.74 and 1.75 as they are not in 
alphabetical order currently.

6. Cleanup in 6.1.1:  Delete "the" after "of" and before "each" in the 
lead-in.

7. 10.3.2:  In "(f)", change "(e)" to "(g)".
  In "(j)", I don't understand why we would accept it.  If the Purchaser and 
Owner are the same party, I read this subsection to say that GE does not ower 
Takeover LDs - how could this be?  Please advise.

8. 10.15 and certain places thereafter:  Is "TDI" supposed to be a defined 
term?

9. 15.2.1:  In the third sentence, do we want to use the defined term "Import 
Duties"?

10. 17.3(b)(ii):  Why are the licenses, authorizations etc in the second half 
of the subsection to be assignable only to Purchaser (to the extent 
assignable) and not to "Purchaser, or to any person designated by Purchaser 
without any right to compensation not otherwise provided for herein" as the 
lead-in to the subsection states for certain other items to be assigned?

11. Article XIX:  Has David Marshall reviewed this section from both an Enron 
as purchaser and Enron as agent for E-Next perspective?

12. 22.2:  I thought in all our negotiations with GE, that the language we 
used when we assigned the turbine purchase agreements from WestLB to E-Next 
was to be the basis for this contract.  The recent request for Rose to 
provide such language to the team again only reinforces my thought.  Why is 
the old language which does not allow for flexibility in financing methods 
(lenders don't have flexibility to "cash-in" their collateral if Purchaser 
defaults) and has GE listing what reasonable consent is still in this draft?

 Isn't the last paragraph in this section somewhat duplicative with 2.2 but 
more restrictive in stating when a replacement guarantee is required?  Can't 
it be deleted?

13. 27.1:  I realize Limitation of Liability is still being negotiated with 
GE but I don't understand why we would allow them to be liable for less than 
100% of the Purchase Amount especially since they are holding us liable for 
100% of the Purchase Amount.  As with the EPC Contract, the lenders will have 
concern and may not be willing to finance the turbines if GE's LOL is less 
than 100%.

     to Rambo in Mansfield/South Dallas

   My e-mail was in response to all the ones i've received lately.
   Did i criticize the public displays ? i just said i didn't
understand them.  Whatever floats your boat, G.
   I'd like to further emphasize one point.
   On a INDIVIDUAL basis, Americans are the most compassionate and
good-hearted people i've personally come across  (much more than
the Europeans - i was there, i saw - and much, much more, i hate
to say, than us)  We are all refugees, and all of us have been
helped along the way, if not with $10,000 in cash (lol), but on a
personal level, by kind, compassionate people. The scale of blood
and money donations we are seeing now can never be approached
anywhere else in the world.  And not just in this extreme, tragic
case, this has always been true.  The Marshall Plan, earthquakes
in Turkey, floods in Bangladesh, etc... Americans have always been
there to help, if not in manpower, at least in cash donations. In
the immortal words of you-know-who, Americans are good people.
   However, good people do not patriots make.
   Where were the patriots when, after Pearl Harbor, the
resolution in Congress to enter WWII passed by ONE vote ? Were the
patriots, those people who lined up the streets of Washington and
claimed that F.D.R. was a warmonger, a traitor, and a Jew-lover ?
   Were they patriots, those young men and women ("the flower of
America's youth") who insulted and spat at the Vietnam Veterans
who returned home ? Let us not argue the merits of the (illegal)
war in VN. But shouldn't patriots at the very least show support
for their troops ?
   Were they patriots, those companies which, during the height of
the Iran hostage crisis, tried to deal with the enemy and make a
profit ? (Marc Rich was not an isolated case)
   In the next few weeks, will people try to dump their stocks in
the hope of making a killing or cutting their losses ?  (Greyhound
stocks anyone ?)  Continenetal has already laid off 12,000 people,
couldn't they have waited, and don't you believe they wanted to
make the cuts all along but jumped on the opportunity ?
   America at its heart is a nation of self-interest - money.
It goes to war in the name of that self-interest, not in the name
of IDEALS (the Gulf War was meant to defend and save the poor,
little Kuwaitis...rite...)  That self-interest makes America rich
and strong - and all the more power to them, we all want to be
rich and strong.  The question is, will its people die for it?
   Hopefully, we'll never find out - no one wants a fukkin' war.
I just wonder (WONDER, not question, criticize, or judge) if the
same Joe Smith who is screaming for war rite now on CNN, in a few
months' time, after the grief and justifiable anger have died
down, will he be so willing then to drop everything and go to war,
HIMSELF, on the GROUND in Pakistan or Afghanistan.  Once more,
Buddha saves us, we'll never find out.

PS
   I claim that if i win the $10,000,000 Lotto jackpot, i will
donate half of it to chairty. With my TRACK RECORD, would you
wonder my resolve ?  How dare you ?  Joe Smith does have a track
record too.

Accompany that with the fact that we have not gone to Tony's as a group, and just recently went to the Front Porch, and haven't been to Cahill's in a long time and it's crappy outside.  Therefore I have to give the nod to...
 
the Sanchezcamp, barring a major uproar from the Friend camp.
 
What say ye?
