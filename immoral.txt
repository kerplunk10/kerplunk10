iniquity (i-NIK-wi-tee) noun

   1. Gross immorality or injustice; wickedness.

   2. A grossly immoral act; a sin.

[Middle English iniquite, from Old French, from Latin iniquitas, from
iniquus, unjust, harmful : in-, not + aequus, equal.]

   "One golden rule is to accept the interpretation honestly put on
   the pledge by the party administering it. Another is to accept the
   interpretation of the weaker party, where there are two interpretations
   possible. Rejection of these two rules gives rise to strife and
   iniquity, which are rooted in untruthfulness."
   M.K. Gandhi, The Story of My Experiments With Truth, 1927.


This week's theme: words from Gandhi's autobiography.

The reason there are so few female politicians is that it is too much trouble

How Would You Like to......
1. Drastically Reduce Personal, Business and Capital gains taxes?
2. Create a six figure income every 4 months?
3. Legally make yourself and your assets completely judgment-proof,
seizure-proof, lien-proof, divorce-proof, attorney-proof, IRS-proof, 
and become completely insulated?
TAKE A SERIOUS LOOK AT YOUR LIFE.....
Do you think you are paid what you are worth? 
Will you be set to retire in the next few years? 
Do you control the course of your day, or does someone watch over you?
The fact is we have many people in our enterprise that earn over 50k per
month from the privacy of their own homes, and are retiring in 2-3 years(wealthy)
and having total freedom-both personal and financial.
Many have been conditioned to believe it must be illegal, immoral or unethical 
to ever earn any real profits from our efforts. The sad truth
is,it's been designed that way by the ultra-rich and ultra powerful since
before any of us were born.If you are interested in radically changing your financial

From your  daughter...Abigail...in Los Angeles
  Dear Mom: As I watch the  inaugural, I am still
crushed that Al Gore
did not get in office. Look at  that Texas jerk with
the cowboy hat on!!
What a disgrace. And look how  immoral he is...getting
a ticket for
drunken driving 24 years  ago!!
  And....aren't you so excited? Jesse Jackson has a
new  child !! I sent
him $5.  I used to send him $50...but my electric  bill
was $2,345 last
month, and I was short of cash. That is not  bad,
though...Susan's bill
was $3000 because she has a TWO-bedroom  apartment. I
am hoping to meet
Jesse's new girl friend out here. I think  she is
living with his other
girl friend from 1996. (Or maybe it was the  1994
one.... I forgot.)
  I love California...everything is  so
"environmentally correct" here.
And all our liberal friends are in  power now. I am
sure glad we
demonstrated against building all those power  plants 8
years ago...or
else this state would be polluted like Texas  and
Georgia.  My friends
and I are going out tomorrow to demonstrate  against
that nuclear power
plant they recently re-opened. We shut that  down in
1994, and I think
some Republican sons of b------ are re-opening  it.
Probably just to keep
the businesses going. GEEZ!!
   Well...don't call me on Mondays, Wednesdays, or
Fridays because those
are  the designated days with no electricity. Not on
Tuesdays or
Thursdays  either...because those are the designated
days with no water
or  phones.  Call me on Saturday between 3 and 4
PM....usually we  have
power then. I don't understand why states with lots of
power like  Texas
and Georgia don't try to help us out.
  We won't have to  worry much longer about pollution
because all the
businesses are shutting  down, and there is no jet fuel
for the
airlines.  And gas is $8.50 a  gallon...so no one can
afford to drive.
  I LOVE California !!  Thank God for the Democrats !!
Love... your  daughter,
Abigail

Let's get right to the point.

I am looking for positive motivated people that
want and need to increase their income by 10k per month.

Do you have a burning desire to change the quality
of your existing life?

Would you like to live the life that others only dream about?

If you think this is too good to be true or are skeptical
then this may not be for you... Many have been conditioned
to believe it must be illegal, immoral or unethical to ever
earn any real profits from their efforts.

The fact is we have many people in our enterprise who earn
over 50k per month from the privacy of their own home and
are retiring in 2-3 years obviously wealthy and having total
freedom both personal and financial.

How would you like to:
1. Drastically reduce personal, business and capitol gains taxes?
2. Protect all assets from any form of seizure, liens, or judgments?
3. Create a six figure income every 4 months?
How about:
1. Restoring and preserving complete personal and financial privacy?
2. Create and amass personal wealth, multiply it and protect it?
3. Realize a 3 to 6 times greater returns on your money?
4. Legally make yourself and your assets completely judgment-proof,
seizure-proof, lien-proof, divorce-proof, attorney-proof, IRS-proof,
and become completely insulated?

Are you a BIG thinker, BIG dreamer and a person that believes they
deserve to have the best in life?

Are you capable of recognizing that once in a lifetime opportunity
when it's looking right at you?

Countless others have missed their shot at the title only to look back
years later and wished they should've because they could've.

If you are serious about changing your life...

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I am personally disgusted by your willingness to profit from such immoral business practices.  As an actor in California, who typically earns less than $7,000 a year from my craft, I was personally affected by the major increase in energy costs last year.  And I am infuriated that I had to skip meals to pay my energy bill while you personally cleared over a million dollars.  I hope you spent a substantial part of your earnings supporting the arts in your local community, donating to public libraries, funding a scholarship program for low-income students in impoverished neighborhoods, or in some other way improving our community.

In case you were too selfish to consider building your community with your profits, I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Who needs $100 million dollars?  Forbes ran a series a few years back about people who'd made millions, but lived quiet lives and donated substantial chunks of their money to charitable causes.  Remember Rockefeller, the Morgans, the millionaires of the early 20th century?  They built their community, recognizing that they benefited from a well-fed, better-educated populace.  Too bad the millionaires of today don't share their commitment.  We have a lot of people who could use a helping hand every now and then.

Sincerely,

J. Harrison

The stream of internet bullshit is never-ending.
If the FBI had ANY concern about this, we would see it on the news.

But I heard from a friend's friend that the Taliban hates atheists (like
myself) most of all, and believes that if you give them lots of money they 
will destroy themselves in an orgy of hookers and cocaine - because they are 
immoral, Godless creatures. If you don't do as they say, they will blow up 
your house on the 10th day of the 10th month of this year (like Nostradamus predicted).

N E I L   A N D E R S O N   D A I L Y   D E V O T I O N A L
             from Freedom in Christ Ministries

January 31

MODELING GROWTH

Prove yourselves doers of the word, and not merely hearers who
delude themselves (James 1:22).

I am learning about pastors and missionaries across the country
who are preaching against the very sins they are committing
themselves. Nationally known Christian personalities who
vehemently condemn immorality have themselves been found to be
hiding an immoral lifestyle. Those of us who are called to preach
or teach God's Word must put it on first. We must get on our
knees before God as we prepare the message and say, "God, is this
Scripture true in my life?" If not, we had better be honest
enough to say to those who hear us, "I wish I were a better
example of this passage than I am, but I'm still growing in this
area." To proclaim the Word of God as if it were true in your
life when it's not is a lie.

Those of us who receive the Word are also vulnerable to
self-deception if we fail to put it into practice. We hear a
sermon or a lesson and say, "Wow! What a great truth!! and hurry
off to share it with someone else without processing it ourselves
and applying it to our own lives. James said that hearers of the
Word who are not also doers of the Word deceive themselves.

Why are we afraid to admit it when our lives don't completely
match up to Scripture? I believe it's because many of us have a
perfection complex. We think we have to model perfection and not
admit to something less. But we can't model perfection, because
we're not perfect; we can only model growth. The people around us
need to know that we are real people in the process of maturing.
They need to see how we handle failure as well as how we handle
success. When we model this kind of honesty in the Christian
community, we greatly reduce the possibility of the deceiver
gaining a foothold.

Lord, forgive me for the times I have placed the quest for
earthly perfection ahead of growth in You and Your Word. Help me
model growth in my life today.

It's about time!

By Mike Taugher

                       TIMES STAFF WRITER

                       An East Bay state senator is calling on the
                       governor to investigate what he called "price
                       gouging" by a taxpayer-supported agency in Los
                       Angeles.

                       "It's one thing to have some Texas guy ripping
                       you off, but it's another thing to have a public
                       agency in your own state," said Sen. Don Perata.
                       "I think they ought to give the money back."

                       The Oakland Democrat cited reports that put the
                       Los Angeles Department of Water and Power's
                       profits from sales to the state during the past
                       seven weeks at $400 million during a period when
                       the state's electricity bill has moved past $2
                       billion.

                       Perata, comparing the agency's electricity sales
                       to its raids on northern counties' water during
Los
                       Angeles' formative years, said a rebate is in
order
                       to prevent heightened conflicts between Northern
                       and Southern California.

                       "I think it's perfectly legal," Perata said. "I
think
                       it's immoral."

                       But Frank Salas, chief of staff for the Los
Angeles
                       agency, said his department is selling
electricity
                       at a reasonable 15 percent profit. He said recent

                       sales to the state have been in the range of $300

                       to $350 per megawatt-hour and that the $400
                       million profit figure cited by Perata was grossly

                       inflated.

                       "We would welcome an investigation," Salas said.
                       "If there is an investigation, we would be shown
to
                       be a good neighbor to the state and not a price
                       gouger."

                       Perata said that if Davis does not investigate
the
                       state's purchases from the Southern California
                       agency, he will file a formal request under the
                       public records law to force disclosure regarding
                       the purchases.

                       Details about the state electricity purchases
have
                       been shrouded in secrecy because the governor
                       says release of the information will allow power
                       generators to manipulate prices and drive them
                       higher.

                       "This whole area is a like a star chamber,"
Perata
                       said. "This stuff can't be proprietary if it
involves
                       public agencies."

                       Meanwhile, the head of the Los Angeles water
                       and power agency, who has been tapped by
                       Davis to lead the state's efforts to obtain
                       long-term electricity contracts, said that even
                       though the state is spending about $55 million a
                       day to keep the lights on, state coffers can be
                       refilled without raising consumer rates.

                       "There is no basis for any rate (increase) ...
                       maybe ever," said S. David Freeman, director of
                       the Los Angeles water agency.

                       Freeman was responding to an order issued
                       Wednesday by the state Public Utilities
                       Commission clearing the way for the state
                       treasury to be reimbursed for its power
                       purchases.

                       The PUC, meeting in San Francisco, delayed for
                       at least a week a decision on the more
                       controversial issue of how much the state should
                       be repaid. But it did issue an order that said
the
                       state Department of Water Resources is entitled
                       to reimbursement.

                       Pacific Gas & Electric Co. contends that under a
                       formula set up by lawmakers, the utility is
entitled
                       to collect its costs for buying power before
                       reimbursing the state. According to the utility's

                       calculations, that would mean it would keep all
of
                       the money paid to it by customers even though
                       the state today is buying up to one-third of the
                       electricity used each day.

                       Freeman countered that for every kilowatt-hour
                       the state purchases, its utilities are required
to
                       pass on the roughly 6 cents or 7 cents that
                       customers pay on their bills to buy those
                       kilowatt-hours.

                       "They are whistling Dixie," Freeman said. "The
                       law is very clear it is not their money."

                       PUC President Loretta Lynch said she hoped the
                       commission would decide the question next
                       week.

                       Freeman said he has deliberately kept his
                       distance in transactions between the state and
                       his employer and that he does not know how
                       much electricity the Department of Water and
                       Power is selling to the state. Freeman has been
                       working with Davis for the period of time Perata
is
                       examining.

                       "On my watch there was no price gouging,"
                       Freeman said.

PUC considers rewarding producers that sign long-term contracts 
Greg Lucas, Lynda Gledhill, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau
Wednesday, March 21, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle

N33580.DTL 
Sacramento -- Some cash-strapped producers of wind, solar and other 
alternative forms of energy will get long-delayed financial relief under a 
proposed order by state regulators, Gov. Gray Davis said yesterday evening. 
A proposed order by the Public Utilities Commission is designed to reward 
energy producers who sign long-term contracts with utilities at lower rates. 
Alternative energy producers that voluntarily enter such contracts, which 
would start on April 1, would be paid within 15 days, said Davis, who 
requested the order. Those that do not would have to wait until the utilities 
that buy their power return to solvency. 
Davis blasted Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison for 
not paying the alternative generators -- know as qualified facilities, or 
"QFs" -- even though the companies have been collecting money through rates. 
"It is wrong and irresponsible of the utilities to pocket and withhold the 
money designed to compensate the QFs," Davis said. "It's immoral and has to 
stop." 
Alternative producers -- ranging from massive co-generation facilities at oil 
refineries to tiny biomass plants -- produce about a third of the state's 
supply of electricity. But many are shutting down because utilities have not 
paid them since November. 
The loss of some 3,000 megawatts from tapped-out alternative energy producers 
contributed to the blackouts that snarled California yesterday and Monday, 
according to the Independent System Operator, which manages the state's power 
grid. 
The PUC's proposed order -- which will be considered at the board's Tuesday 
meeting -- offers the generators a choice of agreeing to a five-year contract 
at $79 per megawatt or a 10-year deal at $69 per megawatt, Davis said. 
The order does not address the more than $1 billion already owed to the more 
than 600 alternative energy producers around the state. Davis said to favor 
one creditor over another in past debt could bring on bankruptcy proceedings 
from other creditors. 
The Legislature would also need to act to make the order work. 
"It is critical to keep these facilities up and online," said Sen. Debra 
Bowen, D-Marina del Ray, who estimates that Edison has $1.5 billion in cash 
on hand, and PG&E $2.5 billion. "The utilities owe it to the people of the 
state to pay them." 
Edison said yesterday that it opposed any attempt to place alternative 
producers ahead of their other creditors. 
But Tom Higgins, a senior vice president for Edison International, which owes 
alternative producers some $835 million, said his company was talking to the 
governor's office about possible payment structures. 
Alternative energy producers, particularly those that use high-priced natural 
gas to fire their generators, say that without an immediate infusion of cash 
they must close their plants. 
"We've been obsessed with the health of the utilities and (have) forgotten 
the health of everyone else," said V. John White, legislative director of the 
Clean Power Campaign, which lobbies for alternative energy producers. 
CalEnergy Operating Corp., which operates eight geothermal plants in the 
Imperial Valley producing 268 megawatt hours for Edison has sued the utility 
asking to be paid and to be temporarily released from their contract with 
Edison which has paid them nothing since November. 
CalEnergy has a court hearing tomorrow on its Edison contract. Edison owes 
the company $75 million, and the debt increases by $1 million a day. 
"We've lived up to our end of the bargain but Edison hasn't. We're now not in 
a position to make a property tax payment on April 10 and we're the largest 
employer in the county," said Vince Signorotti, CalEnergy's property manager. 
Unlike Edison, PG&E is paying its creditors 15 cents on the dollar. 
"We have offered over the past five days to prepay for future power not yet 
delivered to keep as many of them operating as possible, but the state needs 
to decide how its going to divvy up the limited money under the frozen 
rates," said John Nelson, a PG&E spokesman. 
The PUC's sudden attempt to recast the rates paid to alternative generators 
comes after several months of inaction, partly a result of waiting for 
legislative negotiations on the issue to conclude. Those negotiations 
eventually failed to move forward.

The stream of internet bullshit is never-ending. 
If the FBI had ANY concern about this, we would see it on the news. 
But I heard from a friend's friend that the Taliban hates atheists (like 
myself) most of all, and believes that if you give them lots of money they 
will destroy themselves in an orgy of hookers and cocaine - because they 
are 
immoral, Godless creatures. If you don't do as they say, they will blow up

The Treasurer, Angelides, is taking a hard line.  We are working with others to get the date pushed back.
California PUC staff has started calling around trying to estimate how many customers have very recently switched or are trying to.  They have made inquiries to our customers, including UC/CSU.

State fights 6,000 firms' energy deals 
Discount power contracts deemed unfair to consumers 
Bernadette Tansey, Chronicle Staff Writer <mailto:btansey@sfchronicle.com>
Sunday, September 2, 2001 
?2001 San Francisco Chronicle </chronicle/info/copyright> 
URL: <http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/09/02/MN155174.DTL>
Thousands of California businesses may reap cost breaks on electricity while other utility customers live with record rate hikes if the state lets stand a spurt of last-minute contracts with private power suppliers. 
More than 6,000 firms, including big retail chains and industrial plants, signed discounted power contracts in July and August as market prices dropped. 
State officials are incensed, saying the private "direct access" contracts with electricity providers could shift the burden for millions of dollars in state power purchases onto households and small businesses. 
State Treasurer Phil Angelides said the same companies that benefited as the state depleted its budget surplus to keep the lights on now want to escape paying their share of the billions spent to ensure power supplies for California. 
"I think it's wrong and it's immoral," Angelides said. 
State officials argue that the summer contracts can still be canceled retroactively because California businesses were on notice that their option to shop around for better deals on electricity was about to be suspended by the state Public Utilities Commission. The PUC is set to consider the retroactive ban Thursday. But energy firms say the summer deals were perfectly legal because the PUC had not yet taken action and made a series of draft decisions that put off the effective date of the direct access ban until as late as yesterday. 
"The drafts were not consistent," said Tracy Fairchild, a spokeswoman for Alliance for Retail Energy Markets, a consortium of generators and energy suppliers. "Which one were we supposed to take seriously?" 
The energy trade group is threatening to sue to protect the summer contracts. Angelides fears that a prolonged court fight could block a $12.5 billion state bond sale to reimburse the treasury for California's emergency power purchases. 
The burgeoning conflict is part of a continuing fight by energy firms and some of their business customers to preserve direct access -- a core provision of the state's 1996 deregulation law. 
Deregulation supporters predicted energy consumers would enjoy lower prices if private generators were allowed to compete with the utilities as power suppliers. But the direct access program was thrown into disarray last year when wholesale electricity prices skyrocketed and the state stepped in to buy power. 
To make sure the state's outlay would be paid back by all ratepayers, the Legislature in January directed the PUC to suspend direct access. By that time, 
most direct access customers were fleeing back to the utilities to benefit from a rate cap that protected them from the soaring market power prices. 
The PUC postponed action on the direct access ban while some legislators were sponsoring bills that would have allowed the program to continue under certain conditions. 
But by July, market prices had come down, and energy providers like Enron Energy Services, AES New Energy and Strategic Energy were again offering direct access contracts. 
Businesses were looking for relief from the record rate hikes imposed on utility customers in June, said Phoenix energy consultant Gina Coleman. Coleman said she helped five retail chains with "a significant number" of stores in California negotiate contracts with Strategic Energy this summer. 
"Business is business, and if you can get a better price for something, you should," said Coleman, who declined to name her clients. She said the lower costs will help the stores keep doing business in California and hold their prices down. 
Daniel Douglass, an attorney for the Alliance for Retail Energy Markets, said any attempt by the state to cancel contracts retroactively would violate the constitutional law. He said energy firms have purchased power to serve their customers under the contracts and would suffer losses if they were canceled. 
Angelides said the same firms that ran to the state for protection when their market contracts became too expensive now want to take advantage of lower power prices he attributes to the stabilizing effect of the state's long- term power contracts. 
"You can't take advantage of the state's stabilizing the rates, then say, 'Thank you very much,' and stick everyone else with the bill," Angelides said. 
State officials have not tallied the total number of customers who signed up in July and August, nor have they estimated the revenue loss that would have to be covered by remaining utility ratepayers. 
Figures compiled by the PUC show that commercial and industrial firms signed more than 6,000 new direct access contracts in July alone. A rough calculation suggests that, as a result, the firms might contribute as much as $64 million less annually to the repayment of state costs. 
The loss might not be significant enough to risk a court fight that would delay the bond sale, state officials said. 
Bu Angelides said the same power firms that helped create the energy crisis by charging exorbitant rates are now threatening a bond issue desperately needed to restore funds needed for education, health care and children's services. 
"What they're talking about doing," he said, "is holding us hostage until they get what they want."

Energy costs soak City Light
by Jim Brunner <mailto:jbrunner@seattletimes.com>
Seattle Times staff reporter
Seattle City Light spent a record $92 million buying power on the market in
March, more than any month in its 91-year history.
City Light officials say the cost of buying power for local residents and
businesses eclipsed the previous records - $84 million set in February and
nearly $80 million in January.
To put that in perspective: In 1999, before the current power crisis, the
utility's total power bill for the entire year was $90 million. "We're
spending that every month now. The dollars that are involved are
staggering," said Paula Green, deputy superintendent of City Light.
It's a cash hemorrhage brought on by Washington's drought, which means less
water in the reservoirs at city-owned dams. That increases Seattle's need to
purchase electricity on a market where prices have zoomed to unprecedented
levels.
Adding to the frustration for Seattle city officials is the fact that most
of that money is flowing to out-of-state utilities and power brokers who are
profiting enormously from the energy crunch.
Last month alone, the bill from Enron, a Houston-based corporation, was
$25.5 million, putting it well ahead of the No. 2 seller, California's
Sempra Energy, which sold $7.4 million worth of electricity to City Light.
City Light still gets most of the 1,200 megawatts necessary to serve its
load from city-owned dams and from its contract with the Bonneville Power
Administration (BPA). The utility buys only about 15 percent of its power on
the market. But that thin slice now accounts for more than 90 percent of its
power costs.
Part of the explanation for March's record power-buying binge was City
Light's recent decision to store up extra water behind Ross Dam on the
Skagit River instead of spilling it through the dam's power turbines.
In a normal water year, City Light officials would be spilling water for
energy and expecting it would be replaced with spring runoff. Now, they're
saving the water so it can be spilled later to help salmon runs and to
generate power for Seattle this summer, when energy prices are expected to
surge even higher, to more than $400 per megawatt hour.
"We're insulating ourselves. By putting out one eye now, we're avoiding
cutting off our head later," said Bob Royer, City Light spokesman.
Seattle ratepayers are feeling the pain, with a 28 percent City Light rate
increase so far this year. More rate increases are likely on the way.
Higher rates have also led to plant closures and layoffs in Bellingham and
Spokane.
Meanwhile, Enron's revenues more than doubled last year, to $101 billion.
Its stock prices surged to end the year at $88 a share, up from $44 the year
before. The stock was trading at $57 a share last week.
"It doesn't just feel unfair, but immoral that these major companies like
Enron are making billions of dollars at the expense of everyday people and
businesses," said City Councilwoman Heidi Wills, who chairs the Council's
Energy and Environmental Policy Committee.
"There's this enormous transfer of wealth from our ratepayers to the
shareholders of these companies," Wills said.
Northwest leaders have called for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
to impose price caps. But opponents say price caps would do nothing to
encourage the construction of new power plants, or energy conservation.
Karen Denne, an Enron spokeswoman, said it's unfair to fault the company for
selling power at prices dictated by the free market. "Enron is providing
electricity to a market that needs it," Denne said. "It's unfortunate when
regulators are pointing fingers, looking to fix blame, when this is a
problem of supply and demand."
The company hails from President George W. Bush's home state of Texas, and
is one of the top "soft money" donors to political campaigns. Enron and its
executives gave $435,000 to the Democrats and $1.2 million to Republicans
last year, according to Common Cause.
Its chairman, Kenneth Lay, has consistently been one of the top donors to
Bush's presidential and gubernatorial campaigns.
Enron doesn't own a lot of dams or power plants. Instead, the company makes
money as a middleman - buying power from utilities and then reselling it for
a profit. The company, formed in 1985 from the merger of two pipeline
companies, has become the largest trader of wholesale electricity in North
America.
Part of its success in the energy market stems from its groundbreaking use
of the Internet to make buying electricity as easy as ordering a book
online. You just point, click and spend.
"It's easier than Amazon," said Steve Lewis, a power marketer with City
Light, demonstrating the company's Web site. It lists available power
"products" and the asking price for both buyers and sellers.
Lewis and other power marketers monitor City Light's projected power needs
and then use the phone or Internet to schedule electricity for the next
hour, next day or months ahead. They try to find the best price available,
but it's clearly a sellers' market.
Utilities routinely buy power that used to cost $30 per megawatt hour for
more than $200. At times last month, City Light was buying power for $450 a
megawatt hour. And it's not because the cost of generation has gone up.
"This is pure profit," said Green, deputy superintendent of City Light.
There is evidence that the Northwest is in some ways being hit even harder
than California, whose experiment with deregulation is blamed for roiling
the power markets. A recent analysis found that Pacific Northwest utilities
are paying the highest prices in the nation for the next-day delivery of
wholesale power.
However, regional utilities also sell power for extraordinarily high prices.
In fact, some of the highest average prices paid by City Light last month
were to neighbors.
Puget Sound Energy, Western Washington's largest electric utility, charged
City Light the highest average price of any seller last month, at $303 per
megawatt hour, according to City Light's preliminary billing estimates.
Spokane's Avista Energy charged $281.
That compares with Enron's average price of $173 per megawatt hour and an
overall average of $194.
The BPA, by comparison, charges City Light $22 per megawatt hour.
City Light typically relies on local utilities more when it needs power
delivered immediately. And prices for short-term deals can be higher
depending on the time of day. The city has only a long-term contract with
the BPA.
Despite the record-setting month, city officials hope they'll be in better
shape before the year is out. Mayor Paul Schell has taken to calling Oct. 1
Seattle's "energy independence day" because that's when the city will begin
receiving more hydroelectric power under a new contract with the BPA.
The historically cheap BPA power, combined with a contract with a gas-fired
power plant in Klamath Falls, Ore., should reduce the city's reliance on the
open market, city officials say.
But the BPA, too, has been stricken by higher market power costs and may
have to increase its rates to City Light by 250 percent. The City Council
has already agreed to pass those higher costs on to Seattle ratepayers
although it's unclear how much that would raise the bill of the average
person.
Even at a higher rate, City Light officials regard the BPA power as a good
long-term strategy for getting power costs under control. If they succeed,
the rate increases approved this year could eventually be rescinded.
Until then, local ratepayers will have to keep writing bigger checks to City
Light with the knowledge that some of their money will find its way to
Texas.

Seattle City Utility Racks Up $92 Million in Power Purchases in March

Apr. 16--Seattle City Light spent a record $92 million buying power on the 
market in March, more than any month in its 91-year history.

ISSUES IN INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY
January 2002, Number 25

REJECTING THE LESSONS OF EXPERIENCE
Sidney Weintraub

The turmoil that Argentina is now going through is so costly for the majority of the Argentinean population that it demands some answers to the question, "Did it have to happen?" The same question arose when the Mexican financial structure imploded in 1994. My single word answer in both cases is "No." In each case, the disaster followed a similar-although not identical-trajectory; and in each case the political and technical authorities made a bet that they could manage discredited practices. And, in each case, they failed, thereby visiting great suffering on their populations.

The precipitating event of the Argentine debacle was an overvalued and, ultimately, untenable exchange rate. The convertibility scheme adopted in 1991 was brilliant in its simplicity. By assuring the public that enough dollars were to be held in official reserves to cover the monetary base and thereby guarantee that pesos could be exchanged for dollars, on demand, even a skeptical public found the approach credible. Runaway inflation was stopped in its tracks. Overall economic growth rates soared, at least for a while. The technique was a variant of the Mexican experiment that began in 1987: using the exchange rate as the anchor to defeat inflation.

What "did in" the Argentine experiment was the appreciation of the U.S. dollar. This led, inevitably under one-to-one convertibility, to the appreciation of the Argentine peso, and despite the preaching of ideologues that it is immoral to alter an exchange rate, the price of a country's money-its exchange rate-does affect its exports and imports. On top of this, Brazil devalued its currency, the real, in 1999, and what Argentina faced was the appreciation of its currency while that of the country that took one-third of its exports depreciated. Argentina nevertheless retained the overvalued exchange rate and, in the process, further destroyed the country's competitive position. Inflation was kept in check, but the country has suffered economic downturn ever since.

This description omits other aspects of Argentina's economic, political, and social situation. These include relatively modest fiscal deficits (the public sector borrowing requirement averaged about 2 percent of GDP between 1991 and 1998, at the national and provincial levels combined); growing social inequality and poverty; too many feckless politicians who looked at government service as a source of enrichment; and reckless borrowing, public and private, domestic and foreign. Argentina met its debt obligations by more borrowing, but this was a large Ponzi scheme because the inability to earn enough foreign exchange from exports meant that the rigid one-to-one structure had to collapse, sooner or later.

Mexico, in 1987, adopted a form of price controls, under what was called a pacto de solidaridad, to lower its inflation. The pacto, or agreement, called for the private sector to limit price increases, labor to limit wage demands, and the government to control its expenditures. When the pacto started, Mexico devalued its currency sharply to leave room for appreciation of the peso in order to prevent devaluation from raising inflation. The pactos were kept in place, with annual modifications, from 1987 through 1994. The anchor for Mexico's anti-inflation policy was an increasingly overvalued peso. Inflation declined gradually, year after year, rather than abruptly as it did in Argentina after convertibility, but economic growth in Mexico in these years was modest.

As in Argentina, the Mexican political authorities (the president) and the technicians (the finance minister, with the cooperation of the head of the central bank) were unwilling to change the exchange-rate structure, a form of crawling peg. Instead, they took the risk that they could delay devaluation until some time in the future. There was general agreement that the Mexican peso was overvalued, and the way the authorities dealt with this in foreign borrowing was to issue short-term notes that had a dollar guarantee-the so-called tesobonos. This house of cards collapsed in December 1994, about three weeks after the previous president left office. The Mexican authorities gambled, and the population lost.

As in Argentina, there were other elements in the Mexican collapse. There were assassinations of political leaders during 1994; the U.S. Federal Reserve raised the federal funds rate six times during the year, seriously affecting Mexico; the government budget was kept in balance, but development banks were allowed to provide uncollected credit that amounted to some 3 percent of GDP; political corruption continued much as before; and foreign borrowing, on short terms and at dollar equivalents, rose sharply even as official reserves declined from capital flight and efforts to support the exchange rate. In the end, however, what did Mexico in was an overvalued exchange rate that was kept in place far too long.

In the case of Brazil, the scenario unfolded differently. The real plan was put in place in mid-1994 in an effort to reduce inflation without burdening economic growth. As in Mexico, in Brazil the stable exchange rate worked and inflation was reduced. Brazil weathered the tequila effect of December 1994, when the Mexican peso depreciated, without any sharp change in the real plan. However, Brazil was hit sharply by the aftereffects of the Russian debt default in 1998 because investors either had to cover positions or became nervous about keeping capital in Brazil given its precarious situation. In January 1999, Brazil devalued the real and took other corrective measures. Brazil did not have the turmoil that either Mexico or Argentina faced when they were forced to devalue under the most adverse circumstances. Brazil acted more quickly, before a deepening crisis made action exceedingly costly.

The currencies of Brazil and Mexico are both floating, and thus far, the mechanism is working. Argentina has announced that it will allow its currency to float for domestic transactions but that it will be controlled for foreign trade. That is, Argentina will have a dual exchange- rate system, justified by the assertion that because the one-to-one structure was in effect for so long, the country needed six months for moving to a single, floating currency. Argentina's new president, Eduardo Duhalde, has also stated that the country's opening to imports has been a disaster and that trade policy will become more nationalistic (protectionist).

At this point, two comments. Dual exchange rates have a history of failure, especially by abetting corruption. Argentina has tried protectionism before, especially under Juan Per?n, and it did little other than to increasingly impoverish the country. In the interest of Argentina's future, one can only hope that the dual exchange-rate system does not last very long and that the economic nationalism will not be too severe.

The deeper issue is to ask why government leaders pursue policies that have a history of failures. This is a task for psychologists, not economists, but I will give it a try.

		?	It is politically unpopular to devalue a currency; therefore, why not push off the unpleasantness for as long as possible? The suffering for doing this will come later, perhaps on someone else's watch.
?	Memories are short-those of the politicians and technicians who repeat past mistakes, and of the general public. In addition, memories often gild the past, forgetting that Latin America's poverty and inequality were created during periods of past protectionism.
?	Intelligent leaders become wedded to policies they put in place and are often emotionally unable to change what they have been doing. Domingo Cavallo was fabulously successful as economics minister in Argentina in the early part of the 1990s and dismally incorrect in his actions when he returned in the De la R?a government in the same position. In Mexico, in 1994, both President Salinas and Finance Minister Pedro Aspe were so adamant about not devaluing the peso that they excluded technicians from policy deliberations when they did not agree with this position.

It is understandable that many analysts and business leaders prefer fixed exchange rates. When things are going well, this provides a degree of certainty. However, the time to judge the effectiveness of an exchange-rate mechanism is when the system is under pressure. This explains the attractiveness of floating exchange rates for countries prone to economic shocks. It is clear from what is happening in Argentina and what took place in Mexico in 1994 that fixed rates-even a relatively hard fix of the type that Argentina had-can spell disaster when a country is under economic pressure. Perhaps this lesson will stick-at least for a time.

Geneva Convention

Much is being made of the "status" of the terrorist prisoners currently
being held in Cuba.  There have been multiple references to the status
of prisoners of war as outlined by the Geneva Convention.

To help folks learn more about these discussions, GOPUSA now has the
Geneva III document available for viewing.  This document pertains
specifically to the treatment of prisoners of war.  We hope you find it
educational.

Be Still, America is a collection of poignant, soul-healing stories told
in the aftermath of the horrific events of 9/11/01. Author Amy Bartlett,
who lives and works in New York City, shows how God was present in the
disaster -- even amid the ruin and the rubble.

A Brilliant Performance by a Great Leader
By David Horowitz

President Bush gave two speeches in his State of the Union address last
night, which I had the once in a lifetime privilege of viewing from the
gallery. The first was a war speech, the second a campaign speech. Both
were home runs.

The war speech was designed to firm America's resolve. It began with one
of the most powerful opening lines ever delivered on these occasions:
"As we gather tonight, our Nation is at war, our economy is in
recession, and the civilized world faces unprecedented dangers. Yet the
state of our Union has never been stronger." These were true words, a
tribute to the resilience and character of the American people, which
had been adrift during the last decade of misleadership by Bush's
predecessor.

Should Israel Take the Gloves Off?
By Linda Chavez

Lightning isn't supposed to strike twice in the same place, but tell
that to Mark Sokolow. Mr. Sokolow survived the attack on the World Trade
Center in September, barely escaping from his 38th floor office when the
second plane hit and the building collapsed. Then on Sunday, Sokolow and
his family were shopping in Jerusalem, where they had gone to visit a
daughter studying there, when a suicide bomber, a Palestinian female,
detonated a device that killed her and one other, and injured scores,
including Sokolow, his wife and two remaining daughters.

A Terrorist by Any Other Name
By Frederick Meekins

In response to the September 11th Attack upon America, the U.S.
government has vowed to wipe terrorism from the face of the earth.  To
some officials, this noble struggle might become nothing more than a
word game of shuffled papers and fluctuating definitions.

Wearing the 'Uniform' of War
By Austin Bay

Every Monday night, I put on my uniform and head for reserve drill.
However, it's not the uniform per se that makes me a "part time"
American soldier.

Still, for folks with a knack for the obvious, when essaying the
applicability of Third Geneva Convention standards to a particular
prisoner, a uniform (or lack thereof) is a pretty darn good place to
start.

Hey Media, Leave The Kids Alone
By Mike Bayham

In 1964, Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart was asked to define
obscenity.  Justice Stewart then replied, "I know it when I see it."
 The same broad guidelines are used to determine what is newsworthy.

Many people during the late nineties began to ask the question of the
true newsworthiness of the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal.  Because Bill
Clinton's activities were central to a Federal investigation, the
location of the affair and that both participants were in their
political positions by their own choosing the national media felt
justified in relaying to the public the most precise details of the
affair.

When A Promise Is Not A Promise
By Thomas D. Segel

A promise is not a promise when it is given to members of the United
States Armed Forces by their leadership. A promise is not a promise when
the United States Congress can change its pledges into a different
message having no meaning. A promise is not a promise when less is given
than originally guaranteed.

*** Re: The GOP Abandons Its Pro-Life Platform (Bonnie Chernin Rogoff)

Thank you Bonnie Rogoff for speaking out on truths. We all need to raise
the volume, for we are all that is left to be heard. We must re-take the
principals of the Republican Party, and un-merge the right from the
left. Your article is a beginning step in the 'right' direction.
-- Judith Pratt, OK

I have to say that I agree that abortion is wrong, and anyone who does
so is a murderer. However, I believe that President Bush is doing the
best he can, and his ability is a great one. I think he is just waiting
for the right time to pick up the pro-life issue again. He doesn't want
to endanger re-election, and playing nice to the "moderates" and
liberals will help him get re-elected, and then he can start really
putting the pro-life message out.
-- Tony Lemaster

Hats off to Bonnie for having the courage to say we should cut off "W"
for his shameful pandering to the leftist media by shunning the
Republican pro-life platform. In the time since thousands were killed by
the terrorists on 9/11, how many thousands of unborns have been killed
with the passive blessing of the establishment GOP - with Bush and
Ashcroft not lifting a finger to protect them?
-- Don Zimmerman

It's about time that Abortion is removed from the political process.
While I am not an advocate of abortion, I do not believe that it is a
Political concern. Antiabortionists within the Republican Party do not
represent me - and I AM A REPUBLICAN. I demonstrate that with my time,
my talents, my service and my money.
-- Dorothy Danfelser, Elephant Butte, NM

Thank you for the wonderful article about the GOP abandoning the
Pro-Life Platform. I've been very disappointed in the "straddling the
fence posture" that President George W. Bush has taken. I do not
doubt his beliefs for the unborn and the value of their life... I do
doubt his wisdom in ignoring and brushing aside the pro-life
conservatives who made his election to the Presidency possible.
-- Cheryl Williams, Edmond, OK

If the Republican Party does not recognize that there are thousands of
us, Pro-Choice Republicans, it will risk losing it's ability to win.
There are too many other issues that need Republican principles that
dividing the party is a disservice to the nation.
-- Rep. Harry Tipton, WY

*** Re: Congress Fails Military Retirees... Again (Dorothy Anne Seese)

This was excellent!! Thank you.
-- Kathi Palmer

Praise God!! I thoroughly enjoyed your column with the above title. You
have hit the proverbial nail on the head. Keep up the good work!
-- Michael Thompson, Republican for Congress

Ms. Seese misses the point with her moral fantasies about sex.  It is
suffering, human death, and other war-related activities that are
immoral, particularly when the victims are women and children.  War is
probably a non-natural activity, since primitive hunter-gatherers did
not engage in warfare with organized armies.  Sex and sexual pleasures
and their pursuit are entirely normal.

Dilbert Newsletter 30.0
------------------------


To:     Dogbert's New Ruling Class (DNRC)
From:   Scott Adams (scottadams@aol.com)
Date:   May 2000



   Highlights:
------------------------------------------------
- Elian Invasion
- TV Show Update
- True Tales of Induhviduals
- Streaming Video of a Mystery in My Office
- Dogbert Answers My Mail
------------------------------------------------



Elian Invasion
--------------

Many of you in the U.S. have been following the fate of the little
Cuban boy Elian, who came to the United States via a
dolphin-powered inner tube.  Some people believe Elian is some sort
of Holy Child because the dolphins helped him, and because he's
small, leading people to assume he is a child.  I was a believer in
the Holy Child theory until the INS swarmed Elian's relatives' home
and took him against his will.  "Where were the dolphins then?" I ask.

Maybe they were lazy dolphins.  Whatever their excuse, I'm
disappointed that we didn't get to see the INS and the dolphins
fight it out, hand-to-flipper.  That would have been good TV.
Dolphins have a great defensive move where they suddenly turn
around so your fist gets stuck in the blowhole.  Then they beat you
senseless with their powerful tails.  I think we'd all like to see that.

On the plus side, by my reckoning, Elian's dilemma has saved the
lives of at least two celebrities, maybe more.  As you know, during
slow news periods the major networks kill celebrities and make it
look accidental.  Personally, I won't board an airplane unless the
newspaper is packed with good stories.

I prefer the media's latest news-creating technique, wherein they
blame NASA for launching rockets into space and losing them.  In
reality, NASA hasn't done much of anything since 1969, when they
sent three guys in helium-filled space suits to New Mexico with a
black and white camcorder.  I still remember where I was when I saw
it on TV.  I was on Earth.


Dilbert TV Fate
----------------

I'm not exaggerating when I say that literally dozens of people
noticed when Dilbert disappeared from UPN's lineup on American TV.
Officially, UPN told me the show was put on "hiatus."  Or maybe
they said they "hate us."  It sounds the same on the telephone when
you're sobbing.

Apparently someone noticed there were four new episodes that had
never aired.  So, starting on Tuesday, May 30th at 8:30 p.m.
Eastern  (7:30 Central), the first of the new Dilbert shows airs.

In a master stroke of UPN programming brilliance, Dilbert follows
Shasta McNasty, a show geared toward viewers who are...how can I
say this...very likely to die in bowling ball cleaning machine
accidents.  Fortunately, Shasta is a filthy and sophomoric show, so
it will corner the market on perverts and unsupervised minors.
It's a perfect lead-in audience for an animated Dilbert TV show.
If you don't understand that, you will never be a television executive.

The other networks are running nothing but commercials during that
time period.  You don't need to check.  Trust me on this.


March 21st Explained
--------------------

Many readers were confused by the March 21st strip featuring
Dilbert's future self visiting his past self from across time.
Dilbert asks the future Dilbert how his head got wrinkled.  Future
Dilbert points to a device on his chest with a hole in the center
and says, "Stick a finger in this hole."  That's the whole joke.

This is an example of a cartoon that appeals to no one but me, or
so I discovered from my e-mail.  I like the idea that a future
Dilbert would invent a device that has no other purpose than to
make your head deformed.  It's one of those inventions that seem
like a good idea until you try it.  But the funny part (okay, just
to me) is that he would advise his past self to stick a finger in
it, thus making the same mistake twice.

In retrospect, it was just a bad cartoon.  There wasn't enough
information.  But it made me laugh.  If you think the cartons are
made for your benefit, maybe you shouldn't be so selfish.



Why Do Some People Get Paid?
----------------------------

A reader sent me this story:

"Our coffee room has a bulletin board. One day a woman with a ruler
and a clipboard came in and measured the distance between the
postings on the board with the ruler. She took great care to
measure the height and width between each piece of paper, and
between the pieces of paper and the edges of the board. Then,
without a word, she checked off something on the clipboard and went away.

"I was in a daze for the next fifteen minutes.  I couldn't
concentrate during the following meeting. I wondered, does this
woman actually get paid for this? Does she find fulfillment in her
work? Who came up with the idea for this job? Are THEY just playing
with our minds, whoever THEY are?

"Needless to say I went back to the coffee room after the meeting
and moved all the postings around."

[Editor's note: To me, the funny part is that the author of this
story got paid for sitting in a daze during a meeting and later
rearranging the scraps of paper on a bulletin board.]



The DNRC at Work For You
-------------------------

A DNRC member reports on another benefit of membership.

"It turns out that my English tutor at Cornell is in the DNRC.  I
told her that I was in the organization too. That was a month ago
and since then I have been getting constant 'check plusses' for my
essays, regardless of my effort.

"Thanks a million!!"

If you're not already showing preferential treatment to DNRC
members, it's time to start.  Remember, only the DNRC has the good
sense to haze people who have no prospect of becoming members.



Getting Free Stuff the DNRC Way
-------------------------------

If you're annoying enough, you can get free services almost
anywhere, as this DNRC member reports.

"My roommate and I put coins in a jar every time we used the phone.
When it was time to pay the bill, we went to the bank to get the
coins counted. The teller said there was a fee for counting money
because we didn't have an account at that bank.  The conversation
went like this:

'How much would it cost if we had an account?'

'Then it would be free.'

'How much does it cost to open an account?'

'Nothing, it's free.'

'How much does it cost to close an account?'

'Um...That's also free.'

'Then we'd like to open an account, count this money, then close
the account. That's all free, isn't it?'

"She spent a few seconds thinking about this, and then she let us
use the money-counting machine, for free."



Spooky Happenings In My Office
------------------------------

Recently I noticed that beverages were disappearing from my office.
I installed a hidden surveillance camera to identify the culprit.
Check out this streaming video link at myvideoshare.com to see what
was happening.

myvideoshare.com for the free download if you don't have it.  If
you're behind a corporate firewall, hit the "No Video?" button for
instructions on circumvention.

Macintosh zealots should feel free to flame me as usual.



Dilbert.com
-----------

We've revamped the "List Of The Day" area on Dilbert.com.  It's the
most popular part of the site after the comics.  Some of you DNRC
members are impressively funny.  Others just have laughably pitiful
jobs that translate into amusing list items.  Either way, it's
equally funny to me.

We've added a True Tales of Induhviduals page, at
http://www.dilbert.com/comics/dilbert/dnrc/induhvidual.html.
Submit your stories and read those submitted by others.  Feed your
sense of intellectual superiority by reading how dumb other people
are.  It's a guilty pleasure, but pleasure nonetheless.

Another addition to the DNRC section is the cubicle art page, which
features art created by people who were pretending to work. Each
week the best submissions are posted at

True Tales of Induhviduals
---------------------------

And now, for your reading pleasure, more True Tales Of Induhviduals
-- those clueless-but-entertaining blobs of organic matter that
clog our highways and keep our taxes high.


True Tale
------------

My company has instituted Company Values.  Arranged appropriately,
the values are Fun, Agility, Teamwork, Learning, Integrity and
Empowerment.

The acronym speaks for itself: FAT LIE


True Tale
------------

My school subscribes to a system that is supposed to help us find
jobs when we graduate. It works by asking us what subjects we are
studying, what sort of job we want, etc.

When I input my classes and interests it came up with only two
career suggestions.

Careers in IT
Careers in LAW

Neither choice appealed to me.  I tweaked my entries to see if
other options would appear.  It wasn't until I deleted 'English
Skills' from my list of subjects studied that it added a third
career option.

Careers in MANAGEMENT



True Tale
------------

I was standing in line at the grocery store when a loud voice came
over the intercom saying, 'Okay, shoppers, it's time for our hourly
drawing for a bag of free groceries.' In the front of the store
someone was spinning a big wheel with the numbers 1 to 8 on it. The
voice continued, "If your lane number comes up, and you are at the
front of the line, you win." I noticed that a checker was opening
the register next to me. Just at that moment, the number of that
newly opened lane came up on the wheel. The other customers were
too busy cursing their bad luck to realize that the winning
register was empty.  I casually moved over to that line. With great
fanfare, I was awarded the prize -- a bag of free groceries. It was
filled with bizarre items I would never eat, including cinnamon
rice cakes, canned collard greens, Wonder Bread and the like.  So I
gave the free bag of groceries to a woman who seemed terribly upset
at not winning it herself. She exploded with joy like she had just
won the lottery.

Induhviduals are so easy to please.

At Denver International Airport, there are emergency exits, the
type with alarms if they are opened.  Printed on the doors are
signs that say,
"In an emergency, push and hold door for fifteen seconds until
doors open."

[Editor's note: There is a name for people who stand in the
emergency doorway for fifteen seconds during a real emergency:
"flattened."]

I went to lunch with a new employee who was not familiar with the
city.  On the way back, he decided to stop at a bookstore.  Hours
later, my boss and I realized that he had not returned.  Fearing
the worst, we called down to our crack security guards and asked,
"If you needed to take someone to the hospital, where would you
take him?"

The guard asked me to hold.  A few minutes later he came back with
the official answer: "the hospital."


True Tale

When I received a check from my previous company for my 401K
rollover, I noticed the date on the check was 1-18-1999, even
though the check was written in January, 2000.  IRS regulations
don't allow 401K rollovers that are more than 90 days old.  I went
to my former place of employment and pointed out the error to the
HR Duhrector, who had originally written the check.  His solution
was to cross out 1999 and write 2000 above it.  Then he initialed
and dated the change... 1/25/99.

Here are some true phrases used by my boss:

"Ah, that's the flaw in the ointment."

"There's the gem in the haystack."

"We need to increase sales!  Let's throw some more wrenches in the

"I believe that like I believe a hole in the head!"


True Tale

My office is near Orlando, FL.  An Induhvidual in my office noticed
several people leaving the building.  She asked me, "Where is
everyone going?"  I told her we were going to watch the shuttle
launch.  She asked, "Is it outside?"


True Tale
------------

I was buying a newspaper at the convenience store.  The clerk looks
down at the paper and says, "Is that fifty cents or a dollar? I can
never remember."

I pointed to the clearly-visible price of 50 cents printed on the
corner of the paper and said, "Fifty cents. Who'd pay a dollar for
this paper?!?"

"Oh, some people do," said the clerk.

"Really? Why?"

"Because that's what I charge them."



True Tale
------------

My boss called me into his office.  While attaching a keyboard to
his computer, he asked if I would mind going to my desk and running
a particular program.  He needed the data right away and my
computer was the only one set up for this particular function.

I said that it was no problem and headed to my desk, only to find
that it was MY keyboard he had taken.

A bank recently sent a letter to its bankcard holders with some
details about its new cards. The first line of the letter is a real
whopper:

"The year 2000 has come quicker than expected!"

[Editor's note: Customers of that bank might want to double-check
their interest calculations.]

This conversation actually happened.  The names have been changed
to protect the stupid.

Jack: "G.W. Bush is fairly attractive, especially for a man his
age."

Jill: "Yeah, I guess he's gotten better looking since he was
president."

Jack: "Eh??"

Jill: "I mean, he looks much younger than he did when he was
president in '92."

Jack: "That's because it's HIS SON!"

[Editor's note:  After Dogbert takes over, Jill will be used as a
knickknack on a very large shelf.]

In the dining hall at my school, a sign reads, "At Cornell Dining,

we want all your dining experiences to be successful."

[Editor's note:  Maybe I'm twisted, but I have many images in my

At our company we frequently need to discard empty boxes that won't
fit in trashcans.  The Induhvidual who picks up the trash ignores
anything outside the trashcan unless you tape a big sign on it that
says "TRASH."  This is very annoying but we've all gotten used to it.

In a seemingly unrelated event, folks started thinking that we
should have a "disaster plan" just in case a tornado wipes out the
building. We were told to gather up copies of everything needed to
put us back into business after a catastrophe.  Hundreds of boxes
full of documents were gathered together, categorized, inventoried,
labeled and put near the dock for transportation to the underground
caves, where they would be safe. The Induhvidual who ignores our
empty trash boxes promptly threw them all out.

True Tale

Our marketing director was nicknamed Axel. He decided to have a
departmental meeting to explain his new role after the
reorganization.

He compared the company to a car, and the various departments as
the wheels.  To finish off, he asked a question. "So, what do you
think keeps the wheels attached to the car?" He expected someone to
shout "The axle," relating to his own role and nickname. To his
annoyance, someone yelled out "The nuts."


True Tale

As I was being terminated, the VP asked that I not be too critical
of him in case he hadn't made the right choice in firing me. This
was an unpleasant experience for him. He also asked for my
understanding because he might have to fire more people later in
the week.  In the company's management training, they stress the
need for empathy when letting an employee go. No doubt he missed
the part where they said empathy TOWARDS OTHERS.

I was having dinner recently at a nice restaurant and I asked the
waiter if the soup had meat in it.  His reply:  "Not really."

I'm a Democrat but I voted in the Republican primary because I can
in South Carolina.  While in line at the voting location I talked
to two married Induhviduals. One was voting for Bush and the other
for McCain.  When I asked them if they weren't concerned that their
votes would cancel each other out, the husband said, "Well, we
wouldn't normally even vote, but we wanted to come out and cancel
out all those Democrats who were going to vote Republican today."



Revenge Is A Dish Best Served to Someone Else
---------------------------------------------

Approximately every ten minutes some @$$hole gives out my public
e-mail address instead of his or her own to an online store.
People do this so they don't get deluged with junk mail.  But
online stores are getting smarter.  They send confirmations to my
address before initiating the service or mailing the product.  The
confirmation letters often include information identifying the
culprit.  Recently a Patricia White from Virginia ordered some
magazines online and used my e-mail address so I would get her junk
mail.  I was more than happy to "correct" her name as it would
appear on the shipping labels of her monthly magazines.

Here was my response to the online store's confirmation request.


Dear Sirs,

re: Order Number: 16496863

Please change my last name to my married name, as I will be using
that more commonly.

     Old name: Pat White

     Change to New name: Pat McGroin

Thank you for your attention.

Dogbert Answers My Mail
-----------------------

In this section, Dogbert answers my mail.  These are real e-mail
messages sent to me.  The names have been changed to make them
easier to mock.

The first letter is from someone who objected to my strip in which
Dogbert gave Ratbert a bumper sticker reading WWDD (What Would
Dogbert Do).  It was inspired by the popular WWJD (What Would Jesus
Do) bumper stickers.  I thought I was mocking bumper sticker
wisdom, not Christianity, but many readers felt differently.

Dear Mr. Adams,

I have long been a fan of Dilbert, but your strip of today was
worse than witless.  Your cartoon that mocks the WWJD slogan serves
no purpose other than to profane.  You obviously had a case of IQ
catatonia when you drew it.  Evidently, it spread to your editor as
well when you submitted it.  Keep it up and you'll be relegated to
the ash heap of once-trendy nitwits who didn't know the difference
between humor and inflammatory idiocy.

    Byron C.

Dear Boron,

I'm glad you are committed to your philosophy of doing what Jesus
would do.  I assume that includes writing insulting letters to
cartoonists on company time.  Apparently the bibles in Alabama have
a few extra chapters.  If I were you, I wouldn't take too many
suggestions from the Book of Willy.

     Sincerely,

     Dogbert

Dear Mr. Adams,

We are currently trying to raise money to buy new uniforms and
instruments for the Knoxville schools' music programs.  We are
organizing a celebrity auction, and would be greatly honored if you
could donate an autographed item or some other piece of memorabilia
to help make our auction a success.

Sincerely,

Dear Hairy F.,

I can think of no charitable cause more worthwhile than increasing
the supply of bad music in Knoxville. Unfortunately, Mr. Adams has
already given away most of his possessions to other celebrity
auctions.  It's slim pickings now.  But you could have his comb
(rarely needed), his old toothbrush (in six months), and the holes
in his socks.

       Sincerely,

Dear Reader,

Hello! I'm Avinash from Bombay, India. I'm 18 years old and am
presently in college. I require a currency note of any denomination
from the United States of America or any Latin American country for
a geography project that I'm presently working on. I would be
extremely grateful if you could mail a note to my address which
I've written below. If you cannot, then thanks anyway for taking

Dear Avinashwipe,

This is an amazing coincidence.  I too am doing a project that
involves collecting currency from other countries.  After you
finish your project, maybe you could send the piles of money to me
for my project.  My project is a bit more ambitious than yours; I'm
collecting all of the currency from every country.

       Sincerely,


       Dogbert


Dear Mr. Adams,

I am in the midst of an argument and I need a fresh perspective and
I figured that you had an opinion on everything, so.... which came
first, the freaking chicken or the egg?

      Gregory


Dear Eggory,

Put your finger in this hole.

When it comes to football, "piling on" a player who's already been tackled is 
a major penalty that can set your team back a long way. But when it comes to 
markets, piling on by taking advantage of the weak is called "opportunism," 
and it can get you a big bonus. 
Which brings us to California, where piling on enfeebled utilities and 
customers by power generators and power traders has become a way of life. 
Thanks to the idiotic way that California deregulated its electricity 
markets, the generators and traders of power in California have been making a 
fortune because electricity costs have gone through the roof. Meanwhile, 
consumers are getting pounded rather than protected, economic instability is 
spreading throughout the Western United States and some of the utilities that 
distribute power to customers are getting clobbered. One big utility, Pacific 
Gas & Electric, has already gone broke and others may soon follow.
But while the market has produced a horde of losers--California's wholesale 
power bill is running at 10 times the level of two years ago--there is a 
handful of big winners: companies that generate or trade power in the 
California market. Among the winners: Calpine, whose first-quarter profit 
quintupled, compared with last year's; Reliant Energy and Williams Cos., 
whose profits more than doubled; Mirant, up 84 percent, and Dynegy and Duke 
Energy, whose wholesale power profits doubled and quadrupled, respectively. 
Enron, the nation's biggest energy trader, had a 75 percent increase in 
wholesale-services profits, but says little of that was from California. Some 
of these companies' profits would have risen far more--Mirant's would have 
quadrupled--had they not taken big earnings hits to cover the risk of not 
being paid for some of their California sales. If they finally get paid, 
their profits will be outtasight. You can see why some of these companies' 
stocks have heated up as California melted down. 
To be fair, you can't attribute these entire increases to California--but you 
can be sure California accounts for a good portion of them. There are other, 
less obvious winners, too. Among them: the unregulated subsidiaries of some 
companies that own California utilities; aluminum producers that are making 
more money by closing their plants and selling their power allotments than 
they would have made by producing aluminum; farms that find it more 
profitable to resell electricity than to grow crops; and, in general, anyone 
in the Western United States or Canada with an electron to spare and some way 
of getting it into California. 
I'm not saying that these companies are immoral for making a fortune by 
taking advantage of California's problems. Breaking the law by creating an 
artificial shortage--which has been alleged, but not remotely proven--would 
be immoral. Taking advantage of a situation? That's what's known as 
amoral--having no moral values, either good or bad. It's not nice, but it's 
perfectly legal, and it's the way market players are expected to act. 
So when California Gov. Gray Davis said last week that he was planning to 
have a "heart to heart" talk with California power generators, you just had 
to laugh. Because when it comes to business, those people have no hearts. 
They're not supposed to. 
What created the problem in California is not only deregulation, but a stupid 
deregulation plan carried out ineptly: the Kilowatt Keystone Cops, as it 
were. California put a cap on the rates that utilities could charge 
customers, but until recently, it forced utilities to buy all of their power 
in the short-term market. The utilities foolishly agreed to this deal. The 
problem: short-term markets are notoriously volatile. And notoriously 
ruthless. If there's a small surplus of power, you have desperate sellers 
trying to sell power, which can't be stored. But if there's a shortage, 
everyone piles on. Had California utilities been allowed to do the rational 
thing and buy most of their power in long-term markets, they would have paid 
more initially, but they and their customers would be in far better shape 
now. Compounding the problem is that while the state deregulated the 
wholesale rates the utilities paid for power, they capped the retail rates 
utilities could charge. Combine that with total reliance on the short-term 
market and--voila! --you're totally at the market's mercy. And markets have 
no mercy. 
In the old days, when utilities were regulated, there was often waste and 
inefficiency, but power was reliable and utilities cared desperately about 
keeping the lights on. Now, we have markets that don't care about anything. 
Someday, markets may give us total reliability at a cheaper price than 
regulation would. But in the meantime, get used to the piling-on concept. 
Just hope you end up on top of the pile.

Big Energy at the Table; Winning support for your agenda is easy when your 
allies fill out the administration's top chairs

Rich Thomas in Washington

If you were in the oil and gas business, it was a meeting that dreams were 
made of. Nine days before George W. Bush was inaugurated, energy lobbyists 
gathered at the American Petroleum Institute's offices in downtown 
Washington. Their agenda: to write a wish list. One participant remembers it 
fondly. "The tone was, 'OK, what do you guys want? You are going to have the 
ear of this White House'." In came an easel and a whiteboard, and ideas 
flowed: looser rules for drilling on federal lands; more drilling for oil and 
gas in Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico; lower royalty payments for tapping 
offshore wells. After a while, the mood in the room grew giddy. The man from 
the wildcatters' association suggested going All the Way. It was time, he 
said, to rethink the Endangered Species Act. 
That was a wish too far. But many items on that board--and other lists 
scribbled by other energy lobbyists in other offices around town--found their 
way into the recommendations that the president will unveil to the nation 
next week. The API list, in fact, was forwarded to George Bush's transition 
team, which sent it to the Interior Department. On March 20, Interior sent 
many of the same ideas to the Energy Task Force that Vice President Dick 
Cheney had convened on Jan. 29. To close the loop, key leaders from that API 
meeting have since been appointed to pivotal positions in Bush's 
administration--among them J. Steven Griles, an energy lobbyist and the new 
second in command at Interior, and Thomas Sansonetti, an energy lawyer 
recently named the top environmental cop at the Justice Department. The two, 
in effect, will help administer policies they helped to write.
If the Bush administration is homecoming weekend for the energy industry, 
Dick Cheney's task-force report is the pregame tailgate party. Not since the 
rise of the railroads more than a century ago has a single industry placed so 
many foot soldiers at the top of a new administration. While the report will 
recommend an array of what one White House aide advertises as "high-tech, 
21st-century conservation ideas," its core will be a call to find and use new 
sources of fossil fuels, as well as a renewed commitment to nuclear power. 
What voters need to hear "loud and clear," the president declared last week, 
"is that we are running out of energy in America." 
Is there a national "crisis"? California faces rolling summer-electricity 
blackouts. In New York City, officials are scrambling to add small gas-fired 
generators to handle peak demand. Natural-gas prices have doubled in the past 
year. The numbers on signs at filling stations are skyrocketing, and could 
hit $3 a gallon this summer in the Midwest. In a West Wing interview with 
NEWSWEEK, Cheney shied away from the C word. "I think the potential is there 
for it to adversely affect the economy," he said. 
But voters are using the word. In a NEWSWEEK Poll, 71 percent of those 
surveyed say there is an "energy crisis" in California; 53 percent agree 
there now is one in the country as a whole. Given an either-or choice between 
"protecting the environment" and "developing new sources of energy," those 
polled selected energy by 52 to 41 percent, compared with a 49-44 ratio just 
one month ago. 
There's something to be said for turning to energy-industry alums in this 
situation--and Cheney, who like Bush is a son of the oilfields, is not shy 
about saying it. "The fact of the matter is [you get] a lot of expertise with 
people who have been dealing with these issues for a long time," he told 
NEWSWEEK. In his own case, he said, his time at Halliburton, the 
globe-girdling oil-services company, taught him "a hell of a lot about the 
technology of the business," such as benign new ways to drill in Alaska's 
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. 
But Americans are skeptical of industry motives--and, by extension, of Bush's 
ties. When asked to name who had contributed "a lot" to the current energy 
situation, those polled named two sets of villains: the U.S. energy companies 
(66 percent) and overseas energy suppliers, such as OPEC. Bush himself gets 
his lowest approval marks for his handling of energy and environmental 
issues. Democrats, naturally, are pouncing on what they see as a populist 
hole in Bush's armor. Late last week House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt was 
stumping in Chula Vista, Calif.; with transmission lines as a backdrop, he 
vowed to impose new federal caps on electricity rates--an idea Cheney flatly 
opposes. 
The administration may well have raised the political risk via the process it 
used to draft its plan. The Bushies used a secretive, believers-only process 
reminiscent of another such enterprise: Hillary Rodham Clinton's effort to 
write a national health-care plan in 1994. Since the group comprises only 
government officials, White House aides say, it is entitled to keep its 
deliberations private. Still, industry leaders--who dumped $22.5 million into 
GOP coffers in the last election--enjoyed constant contact with the task 
force. Cheney met with a group of utility executives at the Edison Electric 
Institute, whose president, Tom Kuhn, was a leading Bush fund-raiser. No one 
has enjoyed better access than Enron CEO Ken Lay, who recently had dinner 
with his good friend the president. 
The environmental community, meanwhile, got one mass meeting with the staff a 
month ago (and the promise of another this week with EPA Administrator 
Christine Todd Whitman). Efforts to meet with Cheney were rebuffed. Cheney 
himself confirmed he had not met with a single spokesman for the greens. That 
dynamic has only fueled suspicions among enviros about what's going on behind 
closed doors. "They're drumming up a fake energy crisis that doesn't exist," 
says Phil Clapp of the National Environmental Trust. 
To be sure, the Cheney report will make many nods in the direction of 
conservation and renewable resources. Cheney confirmed that it will call for 
tax credits for both. The plan will herald and encourage the advent of less 
intrusive, high-tech means for finding and extracting oil and gas and for 
burning more coal. White House spinners have decided to divide the report 
into five parts--only two of which will deal with the extraction and the 
transmission of new sources of traditional types of fuel. The conservation 
measures will be high tech and optimistically can-do about using Yankee 
ingenuity to give Americans all the cars and appliances they want while using 
less electricity from state-of-the-art power plants. But there will be no 
paeans to the kind of pantywaist, tree-hugging self-abnegation the Bushies 
think President Carter sermon- ized about a generation ago. "This isn't about 
not bathing or turning off your lights," said a top Cheney aide. "This is 
about finding environmentally safe ways to make sure we have the energy we 
need." 
That's not enough, environmentalists say, given the rising threat of global 
warming the green community is convinced comes from burning fossil fuels. 
"The test of any energy plan will be what it does to limit greenhouse gases," 
says Fred Krupp of Environmental Defense. The Union of Concerned Scientists, 
concerned about global warming, says that renewables and conservation could 
displace 20 percent of traditional electricity demand by the year 2020--and 
greatly lessen the need for new power plants. Cheney thinks otherwise. In 
that span, he said, reliance on renewables could indeed triple--a "fairly 
optimistic" scenario but one that would still meet only 6 percent of total 
electricity needs. But that estimate does not include imposing tough new 
mileage standards on SUVs or mandating more efficient appliances. "Part of 
our task," he said, "is to focus on reality, and reality is not 'Well, gee, 
we'll conserve our way out, we don't have to produce any more,' or 'Wind and 
solar will take care of it, so we don't need fossilfuels anymore'." 
Now comes the hard part: selling the plan to the public and to Congress. Some 
GOP strategists are sanguine about overcoming environmental concerns. 
"Nothing like $3-a-gallon gasoline to help make the case," said one. But it's 
probably not that simple. White House strategists are looking for clues on 
how best to hawk the package in polls done for them by the Republican 
National Committee. The surveys show that voters know very little about where 
energy supplies come from or how they now are distributed in what has become 
a relatively deregulated marketplace. "Voters out there think that the 
government guarantees cheap, abundant energy," said one worried Republican 
polltaker, "and that's not the way it works anymore." Other insiders worry 
less about the Democrats than the news media, which they regard as addicted 
to showing videotape of belching smokestacks. "Bush will have the bully 
pulpit," says GOP consultant Alex Castellanos, "but it's not an easy sell." 
But sell Bush must. He'll take his show on the road next week, joined by a 
fleet of cabinet secretaries. They will declare that action is needed after 
years of Clinton-administration neglect. They will say that there are no 
quick fixes, and tout their market-based, supply-side, long-term answers. 
They may use real-world vignettes about energy shortages. (On request, the 
Natural Gas Supply Association provided the White House some.) But politics 
is lived in the short term, and Bush late last week suddenly found himself in 
the role of conservation advocate. He ordered federal facilities in 
California to turn up thermostats, and pledged that they would reduce 
electricity use by 10 percent. Cheney, the interview over, hurried to the 
Cabinet Room for the announcement. It turns out that conservation matters a 
great deal, at least in California, at least for now.

UK: EMETRA plans weekly website metal auctions.

05/09/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, May 9 (Reuters) - Metals Internet trading group EMETRA is to host 
weekly auctions of physical metal on its trading platform, content manager 
James van Bregt said on Wednesday. 
As part of the development of its physical platform, EMETRA was due to hold 
four copper auctions on May 10, but in light of its users' interest, the 
company has not only increased the number of auctions but has decided to make 
them a regular feature.
"When you see how successful the auctions are and given the amount of 
interest we've had, this will be a weekly event," said van Bregt. 
"Our idea was to have four auctions taking place and in fact it was slightly 
swamped and we're now holding seven. In fact, we've even asked several 
participants to keep their powder dry until next week," he said. The seven 
auctions will be for 4,150 tonnes of copper, and one will be a warrant 
auction. 
Of the metal to go under the hammer, 500 tonnes will be available in 
Rotterdam, and another 1,150 in Rotterdam "or parity," van Bregt said. 
Another 1,500 tonnes will be available in parcels of 500 tonnes in Livorno, 
Shanghai and Carrollton, Georgia, while 1,000 tonnes will be available in 
Antofagasta in Chile. 
The "auction hour" will last from 1300 GMT to 1430 GMT, van Bregt said. 
"Provided we get a good level of bookings, say if four out of the seven 
auctions get done, then clearly that tells us that this is the way to do 
things," he said. 
EMETRA began trading on its physical platform last October on its website 
www.emetra.com, with over a million tonnes of liquidity. 
EMETRA was founded in February 2000 as a joint venture between London Metal 
Exchange ring dealer MG plc - subsequently bough by U.S. energy and power 
giant Enron Corp - Internet Capital Group and Safeguard International Fund. 
Last week, Peter Sellars, company chief executive, said that the company had 
secured additional funding to develop its physical platform, while putting 
its derivatives platform on a backburner. 
EMETRA is currently rolling out warrant trading, copper and aluminium rod 
trading and the first stage of its documentation centre.

Talking Stocks
David Haffenreffer, Christine Romans

05/09/2001
CNNfn: The Money Gang
(c) Copyright eMediaMillWorks, Inc. (f/k/a Federal Document Clearing House, 
Inc.). All Rights Reserved.

CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNNfn ANCHOR, THE MONEY GANG: You`re watching THE MONEY 
GANG and we`re Talking Stocks. 
DAVID HAFFENREFFER, CNNfn ANCHOR, THE MONEY GANG: And joining us once again 
is David Katz from Matrix Asset Advisors.
ROMANS: Let`s hit the phones right away. California and Rich, hi there. 
CALLER: Hi. During the nice run up of the last month, I`d lost a painful 
amount of money in Enron (URL: http://.www.enron.com/) . I could never figure 
out what was wrong with this stock. I`d like to know that if you know. And 
also should I keep it and hope for a recovery or should I terminate and try 
to get well somewhere else? 
HAFFENREFFER: This is a familiar story. 
DAVID KATZ, MATRIX ASSET ADVISORS: Yes. In terms of looking at a stock that 
has performed poorly and hoping for a recovery, we generally would not do 
that. We would reassess why you bought the stock in the first place, are the 
fundamentals of the business strong enough. And if they are, we would stick 
with this stock as a losing investment. 
In terms of Enron, it`s been a great performer up until the last month. And, 
as technology has started to come back and as the market has come back, some 
of the stock that were leaders there`d been a lot of profit taking. We think 
that`s the case there. 
Basically we don`t have a strong opinion on this stock. We think it should 
trade up over the next year or two because they do have good fundamentals. So 
we`d stay with it but if the stock were to recover some, we`d take your money 
off the table. 
HAFFENREFFER: Another phone call now from Victor in Illinois. Hi Victor. 
CALLER: Hi. Good afternoon. My question and thoughts - your thoughts on Amgen 
(URL: http://www.amgen.com/) . 
KATZ: OK. Amgen is a - one of the most successful biotech companies. They`ve 
been so successful they`re no longer considered biotech. They`re considered a 
big drug company. 
We think that their prospects and their product line are good over the next 
year but the stock is selling north of 40 times earnings. We`re comfortable 
holding it. But, since you have a limited basket of money that you can put to 
work, we think there are better drug companies out there we prefer. 
We mentioned the Schering-Plough (URL: http://www.schering-plough.com/) 
earlier or Pharmacia (URL; http://www.pnu.com/) , Upjohn (URL: 
http://www.pnu.com/) or an Abbott Labs (URL: http://www.abbott.com/) we 
think, are not as much an upside, but they`ve got a lot less downside. And we 
think they`ll do real well over time. 
ROMANS: Let`s go to Missouri now where Roy has a question. 
Hi, Roy. 
CALLER: Hello. 
ROMANS: What would you like to know? 
CALLER: Hi, I`d like to know the year end of what Procter & Gamble (URL: 
http://www.pg.com/) looks like for the year and over the next year-and-a-half 
to two years if it`s a good buy now? or if I even need to mess with it? 
KATZ: We think it is a good buy now. The stock has been in the Wall Street 
penalty box for the last year. It`s down from $100 a share or more. They 
disappointed the Street so much that expectations were so low that they just 
made the numbers this quarter and all of the sudden the stock`s up $4 or $5. 
We think they`re slowly getting their act together. We think the stock will 
do better. Fundamentals are going to improve over the next year and we think 
the stock can trade back into the high 70s, low 80s. 
HAFFENREFFER: Last question of the afternoon goes to Charlie right here in 
New York. 
Hi, Charlie. 
CALLER: Hi, David. Thank you for taking my call. 
I have a question on Ariba (URL: http://www.ariba.com/) and ADC Telecom (URL: 
http://www.adc.com/) . Would this be a good time as an entry point in these 
stocks? I have about a one to two-year outlook, in other words, I intend to 
keep it for at least one or two years. So would this be a good buy at this 
time? 
KATZ: OK, in terms of Ariba, it`s a risky Internet stock. We would not get 
involved with that right now. In terms of ADC Telecom, they`ve also come down 
about 70 percent. We do think they have good prospects, short-term 
fundamentals are crummy. We don`t think the stock goes down a whole lot more. 
And we think the stock could double over the next two years. 
ROMANS: All right, let`s talk about just your market perception overall and, 
you know, we`ve taken questions from people about what they want to hear 
about, but what kind of stocks do you like? what are your big picks? 
KATZ: One, in terms of market outlook, we think stocks are be higher over the 
next 12 to 18 months. When earnings are crummy and the Fed is lowering rates, 
it`s generally a very good time to be buying stocks. We like select 
technology. Within technology, companies like Compaq (URL: 
http://www.compaq.com/) , which has been miserable, Hewlett-Packard (URL: 
http//www.hp.com) , we think is going to do very well over the next year. A 
smaller company, Adaptec (URL: http://www.adaptec.com/) selling at $11. We 
think it could be at $20. We like the financials. They generally do quite 
well when the Fed is easing. Companies like Comerica (URL: 
http://www.comerica.com/) , FleetBoston (URL: 
http://www.fleetbankbostonmerger.com/) , Bank of America (URL: 
http://www.bankamerica.com/) , all very good investments. We like some old 
economy stocks like a Leggett & Platt (URL: http://www.leggett.com/) or a 
Sherwin-Williams (URL: http://www.sherwin.com/) and select pharmaceuticals. 
We mentioned the Schering-Plough, Boston Scientific (URL: 
http://www.bsci.com/) . So you really want to diversify. Don`t make bets in 
any individual industries. Don`t make that to any individual stocks. 
ROMANS: OK. David Katz, good advice, Matrix Asset Advisors, thank you very 
much. 
KATZ: Thank you.

Business Leader Joins Elite List; Peter Holt to be Honored at Dinner of 
Champions

05/09/2001
Business Wire
(Copyright (c) 2001, Business Wire)

SAN ANTONIO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 9, 2001--The National Multiple Sclerosis 
Society (NMSS) has announced that it will honor San Antonio Spurs Chairman 
and Owner Peter Holt at its First Annual Dinner of Champions on Thursday, 
Sept. 12, 2001. Holt will be presented the Hope Award in recognition of his 
unwavering support of the NMSS. Serving as dinner chairs of the event will be 
Tammy and Russ Bookbinder, executive vice president of the San Antonio Spurs. 
The black tie event will be held at 7 p.m. at The Westin -- La Cantera 
Resort. A "who's who" list of San Antonio business, political and social 
leaders are expected to attend. Funds raised will benefit the National 
Multiple Sclerosis Society -- Lone Star Chapter. 
Since its inception on a national level 27 years ago, the Dinner of Champions 
has raised more than $100 million for client programs, MS-related research 
and individuals living with MS. The honor represents the highest bestowed on 
an individual by the NMMS Society. Today, 70 major cities, from New York to 
Los Angeles and Chicago to Houston, honor prominent leaders and top 
executives on an annual basis. Past honorees include John Chambers, CEO of 
Cisco Systems Inc.; Peter Coors, CEO of Coors Brewing Company; Arthur 
Martinez, CEO of Sears and Roebuck; D. Mark Prestige, president of Tom Thumb; 
Jeffrey K. Skilling, president and CEO of Enron; Ron W. Haddock, president 
and CEO of FINA; and Tom Sherak, CEO of Twentieth Century Fox. Cumulatively, 
these honorees represent the most influential cast of corporate, political 
and entertainment leaders in the world.
Peter Holt is a shining example of this award and is no stranger to the fast 
track of global business. He is a strong proponent of leading by example 
through his value-based management philosophy. Since becoming the chairman of 
the board of the San Antonio Spurs in 1996, he has led the team in 
fund-raising and community outreach programs that range from the United Way 
to efforts with the Fannie Mae Foundation and the Spurs Drug Free League, 
which provides a safe place for grade school children to play basketball 
after school. 
Holt serves as chairman of the San Antonio Spurs and president and CEO of the 
San Antonio-based Holt Companies. The Holt Companies got its start in 1933 
when Holt's great uncle moved to San Antonio and opened a Caterpillar 
dealership. When the dealership's territory expanded and other dealerships 
opened, family members got involved in the business. 
Today, Holt Companies includes Holt Machinery Company, which includes the 
original Caterpillar dealership, and the San Antonio Spurs. "Working with 
volunteers on a community project, with the Spurs players and staff or with 
the Holt Companies, it's always the same," Holt said. "Treat people fairly 
and honestly, and the amount you can accomplish with others is far greater 
than anything you can do by yourself." 
Holt's sentiments are illustrated not only in his involvement with the MS 
Society, but also in his long-standing commitment to community service. He is 
a member of the World Presidents' Organization, sits on the board of the San 
Antonio Council on Drug and Alcohol Abuse, the United Way of San Antonio and 
Bexar County and is a trustee of the Palmer Drug Abuse Program. A decorated 
Vietnam War veteran, Holt ended his two years of service as a Sergeant E5 
with a Silver Star, three Bronze Stars and a Purple Heart. 
The black tie, seated dinner, to be held at The Westin -- La Cantera Resort, 
is expected to raise several hundred thousand dollars for the National 
Multiple Sclerosis Society-Lone Star Chapter. Multiple Sclerosis, a disease 
of the central nervous system, affects an estimated one third of a million 
Americans. 
The NMSS, established in 1946, is the world's largest source of MS-related 
funds, with the exception of the U.S. Government. The Dinner of Champions 
enables the NMSS to continue its work in providing support services for 
people with MS and their families, as well as funding research into the cause 
and cure of this disease. The NMSS spends a larger percentage of revenue on 
direct services than any other voluntary health organization primarily 
serving adults. Close to home, the Lone Star Chapter serves more than 1,200 
people in San Antonio area.

INDIA: CMS evaluating options on India LNG project.
By Suresh Seshadri

05/09/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

MADRAS, India, May 9 (Reuters) - U.S. firm CMS Energy Corp said on Wednesday 
it was disappointed with delays in getting a bankable guarantee for its 
Indian LNG-based power project and was now evaluating its options. 
The statement came close on the heels of U.S. energy giant Enron Corp's 
problems over its Indian unit's $2.9-billion, 2,184-MW project following the 
state power utility's refusal to honour a commitment to buy all its plant's 
power.
CMS, along with India's Grasim Industries , leads a consortium to build a 
$1.6-billion LNG-terminal-cum-power plant at Ennore port, north of Madras. 
"CMS is disappointed in the lack of progress by the Indian government," CMS 
Energy's director of communications, Kelly M. Farr, told Reuters by e-mail. 
"We are evaluating our options and will choose a course of action which 
optimises the value for all of our Indian investments," Farr added. 
India's Financial Express daily said last month that CMS had written to Prime 
Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee seeking his intervention for providing a 
payment security mechanism guaranteed by the federal government, to arrange 
project funding. 
In January, India's finance ministry indicated it may scrap a plan to extend 
sovereign guarantees to three mega power projects, including the Ennore LNG 
project. 
The paper said CMS had indicated its impatience with continued delays in 
providing a guarantee and hinted it may have to pull out of the project in 
case of any further delay. 
The 1,850-MW Ennore project has been promoted by the Dakshin Bharat Energy 
consortium which also includes Germany's Siemens , Australia's Woodside and 
Unocal Corp . 
ENRON SHADOW 
Enron's troubled Indian unit, Dabhol Power Company, finds its nearly complete 
$2.9-billion, 2,184-MW project embroiled in a controversy over the state 
power utility's refusal to honour a commitment to buy all the plant's power. 
The Maharashtra State Electricity Board, which says the power is too costly, 
has defaulted on monthly payments to DPC for the electricity it has taken, 
forcing DPC's board to authorise its management to terminate the contract. 
The CMS-led consortium won the LNG project from the Tamil Nadu state 
government in 1998 and plans to build a 2.5-million tonnes a year LNG import, 
storage and regasification terminal. 
The LNG is to be imported from Qatar's RasGas and the electricity from the 
power plant will be sold to the federal government-owned Power Trading Corp 
of India. 
India opened up its generation sector almost 10 years ago but investment has 
been scarce as most of the country's power distribution is done by 
cash-strapped, state-owned utilities.

The Latest California Power Craze: A Windfall Profits Tax Bill
By Christopher Edmonds 
Special to TheStreet.com
5/9/01 3:17 PM ET 







"Enough already." 
That's the message Raymond James' power analyst Fred Schultz has for 
California and its politicians. 
As the Golden State faces another day of rolling blackouts, Edison 
International (EIX:NYSE - news) begs its lenders not to push its utility -- 
Southern California Edison -- into bankruptcy; Gov. Gray Davis meets with the 
generators he loves to hate; and the generators face the possibility of a 
windfall profits tax. 
Schultz, meanwhile, hopes common sense will soon prevail over the current 
punitive, political nonsene. He is referring to the recent rash of political 
action aimed at the profits of generators that sell power into the California 
market, specifically, the California Assembly's and Senate's moves to impose 
a windfall profits tax on generators. 
On Monday, the Senate passed a bill that would require generators to fork 
over every dollar they charge for power above an $80 per megawatt hour (MWh) 
threshold to the state in the form of a tax. 
Unfortunately, it's the California consumer who is left in the dark by the 
politics of power. 
The bill would effectively set price caps -- something that is really the 
purview of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC. The bill now 
moves to the Assembly, where it appears to have support. In fact, the 
Assembly is considering its own version of the windfall profits legislation, 
lowering the threshold to $60 per MWh. 
Schultz says this action simply highlights the counterproductive nature of 
California's punitive, political approach to solving the state's energy 
crisis. "This round of legislative action is defeating, time-wasting and 
value-destroying," he says. "The initiatives under way, if passed, will 
ultimately destroy the California power markets as we know them today." 
He has a point. The problem in California is a lack of electricity supply, a 
result of a decade of regulatory posturing that discouraged the development 
of new power plants to meet the surging demand for power from the burgeoning 
high-tech economy. 
At the very time California pols should be focused on encouraging new 
generation, they are proposing policies that actually discourage new 
development. "California legislators should ask themselves this: Does taxing 
the sale price for electricity create more electricity supply or less?" 
Schultz asks rhetorically, invoking a lesson from the Boston Tea Party in his 
answer. "Less! Samuel Adams must be spinning in his grave right now. How in 
The Almighty's name is this sort of ass-backward legislation going to create 
more energy in the state?" 
And, now some members of the state Legislature say they don't even need the 
assistance of generating companies to solve the problem -- they'll build the 
plants themselves. A power company with Davis as the CEO and engineered by 
members of the legislature, the same group that managed to create the 
policies that led to the current crisis, isn't terribly comforting. 
The state needs the help of the generating companies. Companies such as AES 
(AES:NYSE - news) Calpine (CPN:NYSE - news), Duke (DUK:NYSE - news) Dynegy 
(DYN:NYSE - news), Mirant (MIR:NYSE - news), NRG (NRG:NYSE - news) and 
Reliant (REI:NYSE - news) can and will help California solve their supply 
problems if they are given a chance. 
Fortunately, few observers believe the windfall tax bill will be enacted and 
even fewer think such a law would withstand a constitutional challenge. 
"We do not expect the proposed legislation to be enacted into law," Deutsche 
Bank Alex. Brown power analyst Jay Dobson told clients on Tuesday. "The law 
as currently written would provide a major disincentive to both the 
development of new generating assets as well as the operation of high cost 
existing assets. This would further exacerbate the shortage of generating 
capacity in the state at a time when the shortage is likely to seem most 
acute." 
Schultz is more direct. "This is warped." 
Windfall Tax: Dimming for Generators?
As rolling blackouts get more frequent, the political hyperbole in Sacramento 
only will increase. And, with other punitive measures similar to the windfall 
tax likely to surface, investors are concerned about the impact of such 
proposals on generating companies doing business in the, er, tarnished state. 
Alex. Brown's Dobson expects some giddiness in the stocks of generators as 
temperatures -- both atmospheric and political -- rise. "Although we don't 
expect the proposed legislation to pass, we do expect the level of 'headline' 
risk to remain high," he notes. "This will likely lead to more volatility for 
the generation stocks in the near term." 
Still, Dobson predicts the "generation sector will outperform" as profits 
surpass expectations this summer. His favorite names are Calpine, Reliant and 
AES. He rates all strong buy. His firm has recently provided banking services 
for Calpine and Reliant. 
Schultz says Calpine and Mirant stand out in the group, a result of their 
approach to the California markets. "Calpine and Mirant are reinvesting 
heavily in California and are in the game for the long haul," he notes. 
"Unlike the Texas trio [Enron (ENE:NYSE - news), Dynegy and Reliant] that 
receives a lot of criticism from the governor, both Calpine and Mirant are 
dealt with favorably and receive the benefit of the doubt in Sacramento. They 
have dedicated millions of dollars to the development of meaningful power 
supplies in the state." He rates both strong buy and his firm has not 
provided recent banking services to either. 
He also notes that Calpine has long-term power supply contracts that would 
avoid the punitive measures of a windfall profits tax, and Mirant is "more 
than adequately" reserved for possible write-offs associated with outstanding 
receivables for selling power in the state. 
Davis Meets the Generators
The governor has summoned top executives from the generating companies to 
Sacramento on Wednesday to discuss the current crisis and possible solutions. 
However, many important players -- including Calpine, Dynegy and Enron -- may 
not even show up. 
Many of the generating companies are soured by Davis' refusal to "call off 
the dogs" in his investigations of possible collusion, price gouging and 
intentional withholding of generation during periods of high demand. At the 
same time, Davis is hoping to convince the generators to forgive a large 
portion of past receivables, to cut prices on long-term power contracts, and 
to build new low-cost generation. 
The irony isn't lost on Schultz. "Davis now has a Senate-backed initiative to 
castrate the earnings stream of wholesale generators should he choose to back 
such an initiative," he notes. "Who in their right mind would walk into a 
poker game knowing the deck was rigged against them? Is extortion still a 
crime?" 
Maybe this time around, Davis will put his cards on the table. If not, the 
generators have every right to walk away from the table.

In football, "piling on" a player who's already been tackled means a major 
penalty that can set your team back a long way. But when it comes to markets, 
piling on by taking advantage of the weak is called "opportunism," and it can 
get you a big bonus. 
Which brings us to California, where piling on enfeebled utilities and 
customers by power generators and power traders has become a way of life. 
Thanks to the idiotic way that California deregulated its electricity 
markets, the generators and traders of power in the state have been making a 
fortune because electricity costs have gone through the roof. Meanwhile, 
consumers are getting pounded rather than protected, economic instability is 
spreading throughout the western United States and some of the utilities that 
distribute power are getting clobbered. One big utility, Pacific Gas & 
Electric, has already gone broke, and others may soon follow.
But while the market has produced a horde of losers -- California's wholesale 
power bill is running at 10 times the level of two years ago -- there are 
some big winners: companies that generate or trade power in the California 
market. Among the winners: Calpine, whose first-quarter profit quintupled 
compared with last year's; Reliant Energy and Williams Cos., whose profits 
more than doubled; Mirant, up 84 percent; and Dynegy and Duke Energy, whose 
wholesale power profits doubled and quadrupled, respectively. Enron, the 
nation's biggest energy trader, had a 75 percent increase in 
wholesale-services profits, but it says little of that was from California. 
Some of these companies' profits would have risen far more -- Mirant's would 
have quadrupled -- had they not taken big earnings hits to cover the risk of 
not being paid for some of their California sales. If they finally get paid, 
their profits will be outta sight. You can see why some of these companies' 
stocks have heated up as California melted down. 
To be fair, you can't attribute the entire increases to California -- but you 
can be sure California accounts for a good portion of them. There are other, 
less obvious winners, too. Among them: the unregulated subsidiaries of some 
companies that own California utilities; aluminum producers that are making 
more money by closing their plants and selling their power allotments than 
they would have made by producing aluminum; farms that find it more 
profitable to resell electricity than to grow crops; and, in general, anyone 
in the western United States or Canada with an electron to spare and some way 
of getting it into California. 
I'm not saying that these companies are immoral for making a fortune by 
taking advantage of California's problems. Breaking the law by creating an 
artificial shortage -- which has been alleged, but not remotely proven -- 
would be immoral. Taking advantage of a situation? That's what's known as 
amoral -- having no moral values, either good or bad. It's not nice, but it's 
perfectly legal, and it's the way market players are expected to act. 
So when California Gov. Gray Davis said last week that he was planning to 
have a "heart-to-heart" talk with California power generators, you just had 
to laugh. Because when it comes to business, those people have no hearts. 
They're not supposed to. 
What created the problem in California is not only deregulation, but a stupid 
deregulation plan carried out ineptly: the Kilowatt Keystone Cops, as it 
were. California put a cap on the rates that utilities could charge 
customers, but until recently it forced utilities to buy all of their power 
in the short-term market. The utilities foolishly agreed to this deal. The 
problem: Short-term markets are notoriously volatile. And notoriously 
ruthless. If there's a small surplus of power, you have desperate sellers 
trying to sell electricity, which can't be stored. But if there's a shortage, 
everyone piles on. Had California utilities been allowed to do the rational 
thing and buy most of their power in long-term markets, they would have paid 
more initially, but they and their customers would be in far better shape 
now. Compounding the problem is that while the state deregulated the 
wholesale rates the utilities paid for power, they capped the retail rates 
utilities could charge. Combine that with total reliance on the short-term 
market and -- voila! -- you're totally at the market's mercy. And markets 
have no mercy. 
In the old days, when utilities were regulated, there was often waste and 
inefficiency, but power was reliable and utilities cared desperately about 
keeping the lights on. Now, we have markets that don't care about anything. 
Someday, markets may give us total reliability at a cheaper price than 
regulation would. But in the meantime, get used to the piling-on concept. 
Just hope you end up on top of the pile.

     (Adds background on trading system in fifth paragraph.)

     London, May 8 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the world's biggest
energy trader, may consider bidding for U.K. power stations to
reduce its risk in trading and make more money from swings in
electricity prices, an executive said.
     Enron is vying with European and U.S. rivals for dominance in
U.K. electricity trading, a market worth about 7.5 billion pounds
($11 billion) a year. Edison Mission Energy and TXU Corp. have
both said they may sell power stations in the U.K.
     Under a new system of electricity trading introduced in
England in March, a company unable to deliver power to a customer
as agreed must buy it on the market. The fluctuation in prices
offers companies such as Enron and U.K. rivals Powergen Plc and
Innogy Holdings Plc gains or losses of as much as 1,000 percent.
     ``A physical power station can put bids and offers into the
balancing mechanism,'' said Richard Lewis, managing director of
Enron's U.K. power and gas, in an interview. ``There is high
volatility to extract there and that is valuable. We look at all
opportunities.''
     The regulator, Ofgem, hopes the new trading system will
increase competition in the electricity market. Under previous
rules, companies weren't penalized if they didn't deliver.
     Prices for electricity in the spot market, or the so-called
balancing mechanism, have varied from 1,036 pounds a megawatt hour
to a negative 434 pounds a megawatt hour when there is excess
supply, said Elexon Ltd., which administers the new U.K. trading
system, on its Internet site.

                      Power Trading

     When the price of power is negative, the trading system
effectively pays companies to reduce generation. If a 200 megawatt
power station breaks down, and prices in the spot market reach
1,000 pounds a megawatt hour, the station's owner will have to pay
200,000 pounds an hour to meet its supply obligations.
     Owning power stations would allow Enron to meet its
obligations by boosting generation at the plant rather than by
purchasing electricity on the market. The company could also boost
output at times when prices are surging, lifting profit.
     Companies owning a single power station, or companies that
generate electricity from sources such as wind, are more prone to
interruptions and provide Enron with possible customers for risk
management products to guard against power failures.
     ``There is huge potential for aggregation of small
generators,'' Lewis said. ``The provision of risk management is
going to be more in demand. This is an opportunity for us to
provide services.''

                         For Sale

     In the U.K., Enron employs 13 traders on its London-based
electricity desk. The company controls 51 power plants worldwide,
and other energy projects in 15 countries on four continents. In
the U.K., it owns a 50 percent stake in Teesside Power Station, in
the northeast of the country.
     Among U.K. generation assets that may be sold are the
Fiddler's Ferry plant in Cheshire and the Ferrybridge station in
Yorkshire, each capable of producing enough power to light 2
million homes. Edison Mission, a unit of Edison International, has
said it may sell the stations to focus on its U.S. business.
     U.K. electric utilities are seeking to make money from
trading amid waning profit from their main generation and supply
business. The price of generation in the U.K. has tumbled with
that of wholesale electricity. Wholesale prices dropped 15 percent
in the year to March 27, according to regulator Ofgem.
     Other companies that may bid for the Edison assets include
U.S. rival Duke Energy Corp., Electricite de France and RWE AG,
Germany's biggest power company, the Sunday Telegraph newspaper
reported March 16.

Scottish Power Streamlines Its Focus --- Uncertainty Over Water Unit, Telecom 
Venture Clouds U.K. Utility's Future --- `We Have a Reasonably Low Opinion of 
the Company'
By Andrea Chipman

LONDON -- After more than a year of lagging earnings, investment missteps and 
unexpected disasters, U.K. utility Scottish Power PLC is hoping a new 
strategy to streamline its businesses will signal a more focused period for 
the company. 
But it has got its work cut out for it. While investors were cheered by news 
that its Utah-based Hunter power plant is back online after a six-month 
outage that cost the company an estimated $160 million (178.9 million euros), 
uncertainty over its plans for its Southern Water unit and apparent 
commitment to Thus, an unprofitable telecommunications venture, are seen as 
muddling the group's focus.
"It all adds up -- the lack of coherent strategy, quite substantial 
downgrades and a whole host of noncore businesses that they don't have any 
natural management flair or expertise in," said Brian Gallagher, a senior 
fund manager at London-based Gartmore Investment Management, which has GBP 3 
million (4.8 million euros) of Scottish Power shares in its Global Utilities 
Fund. "We have a reasonably low opinion of the company." 
The company said its pretax profit before goodwill amortization and 
exceptional items for the year ended March 31 fell 15% to GBP 628 million 
from GBP 736 million the year before. Adjusted earnings per share declined 
26% to 30.65 pence from 41.22 pence. 
The company acknowledged profits have been hit hard by the Hunter outage, 
competition on wholesale and retail markets in the U.K. and strict price 
controls on its regulated infrastructure businesses. 
The company's shares are currently trading at 443.25 pence each, down 17% 
from 533 pence each a year ago. 
Executives say they are restructuring the business into three targeted 
divisions to capitalize on its traditional strengths in generation and power 
supply and infrastructure and to expand its overseas activities. 
"We've now got a trading and commercial link between generation and supply 
and the first thing we are doing is putting emphasis on that . . . on growing 
earnings across that value chain," said Scottish Power's chief executive, Ian 
Russell. "In the U.S., we are focused on cost cutting and on acquiring new 
businesses." 
Scottish Power's move away from a full multiutility profile -- begun last 
year with its partial disposal of Thus and its withdrawal from an Internet 
banking venture with Royal Bank of Scotland -- toward a more narrowly focused 
energy business mimics a trend across the industry toward greater 
specialization. 
The company is also considering selling Southern Water, which would allow it 
to focus even more closely on its power business. 
Yet analysts and investors say they are looking for more details of the 
company's overall growth strategy from Mr. Russell, who took over as chief 
executive last month, and other managers. The toll from months of drift, is 
evident, they said. 
Indeed, despite its efforts to chart a new road, Scottish Power appears to be 
reluctant to acknowledge the failure of some of its noncore ventures. 
Mr. Russell said his company remains "supportive" of Thus, which reported an 
annual loss of GBP 21.4 million this week, and has no plans to unload its 
remaining 50% stake in the company. 
Similarly, he said, Scottish Power hasn't yet made a final decision to 
dispose of Southern Water -- which has cut costs under its Scottish parent 
but is increasingly unable to cover its capital expenditure -- although he 
said the company had received "a number of offers" from potential buyers. 
Although he declined to identify any of the bidders, Italian energy company 
Enel SpA has confirmed its interest. 
People familiar with the industry said a prompt sale of the water unit looks 
likely, with some bids already exceeding the GBP 2 billion at which many 
analysts value the company's combined assets and debt. It is unclear, they 
said, how Southern Water or Thus would fit into Scottish Power's new image. 
"Scottish Power sees itself as an international energy company," a person 
familiar with the company said. In a year's time, he added, "it would be 
unlikely that Southern Water and Thus would be part of the company." 
Revenue from the sale of the water unit would also help Scottish Power pursue 
its U.S. expansion without extending its 90% debt-to-equity ratio, analysts 
and investors said. 
Mr. Russell declined to comment on reports Scottish Power is considering 
buying Enron Corp.'s Oregon-based unit, Portland General, but admitted the 
company would be a logical geographical fit with its Pacificorp subsidiary. 
Analysts said Scottish Power's plans for U.S. growth is likely to be a key 
part of its energy strategy. 
"We like their U.S. strategy, where they've leveraged expertise gained in the 
highly competitive U.K. market," said Gareth Lewis-Davies, head of utilities 
research at Lehman Brothers in London. 
Closer to home, competition and the trend toward increased specialization in 
the power industry may force Scottish Power to determine whether its business 
strength lies in asset management or retail and generation. 
"Strategic decisions need to be made, and I'm not sure if they are going to 
make them in the near term or not," said Andrew Wright, U.K. utilities 
analyst at UBS Warburg in London. "They are pretty much involved across the 
value chain, and I think it remains to be seen which part of the value chain 
they specialize in, if any."

INDIA: Enron India unit lenders move to solve row-papers.

05/08/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

BOMBAY, May 8 (Reuters) - Lenders to U.S. energy giant Enron Corp's troubled 
Dabhol Power Company (DPC) project in India may cut interest rates on almost 
$2 billion of loans to prevent default, business dailies said on Tuesday. 
Indian and foreign lenders are willing to help DPC produce power at cheaper 
cost, but would not hesitate to sue if the stand-off between the government 
and DPC continues, the news reports said.
Enron's $2.9 billion project is mired in controversy after the Maharashtra 
State Electricity Board (MSEB) reneged on its commitment to buy all the power 
produced by the giant plant, saying it is too costly. MSEB has also defaulted 
on monthly payments to DPC for the electricity it has taken, forcing the 
company's board last month to authorise the management to terminate the 
contract. 
That possibility casts a long shadow over the fate of the project's 1,444 MW 
second phase, which is scheduled to start commercial operation next month. 
The 740 MW first phase began operating in May 1999. 
"All lenders, both Indian and offshore, want to see the second phase of the 
project taking off. We may cut the rates if there is any formal request from 
either DPC or the government," the Economic Times quoted an unnamed banking 
source as saying. 
Five Indian financial institutions have lent a total $1.4 billion to the 
project. The five are the Industrial Development Bank of India , State Bank 
of India , the Industrial Finance Corporation of India , ICICI Ltd and Canara 
Bank. 
The lenders are now working overtime to resolve the issue. Last week they 
sent a letter to the Indian finance ministry asking it to clear up $48 
million in unpaid bills owed to Dabhol. 
But the Business Line newspaper reported the banks may take legal action if a 
quick solution is not found. 
"Our money is caught between two feuding parties....If they continue their 
hawkish stand, we will have no other option but sue the company, MSEB and the 
government," the paper quoted an unnamed banking source as saying. 
The dispute has already damaged India's image as a safe destination for 
foreign investment. 
It suffered another blow on Tuesday when the Times of India reported that 
customs officials in Bombay have blocked DPC's imports of project equipment 
due to a dispute over tax rates.

India: Tackling the power mess

05/08/2001
Business Line (The Hindu)

Asia Intelligence Wire

AFTER over a decade of reforms in the power sector, nothing much has changed 
for the better. On the contrary, the situation appears to have only worsened 
further. 
Ten years ago, the power outages - or load shedding as better known - in the 
Capital for a couple of hours in rotation only in summer during the peak 
hours used to be pre-announced. A decade through reforms and Delhiites have 
now accustomed to subsisting without electricity not only in peak summer for 
anything between seven and 14 hours during the day but also for a couple of 
hours in winter.
This summer is turning out to be no different. Rotational load shedding for a 
good six to seven hours in most areas during both night and daytime have 
already started which shows that there is both energy and peaking shortage in 
the Capital. And, if this is the situation in Delhi - the country's so-called 
cosmopolitan pride - the fate of the hapless citizens in the other scorching 
States in the north can well be imagined. 
So, what have the power reforms achieved? Precious little. It's the people, 
and not the politicians, who have come to realise that quality power, like 
any other commodity, is to be paid for. This apart, scores of manhours have 
gone into deliberations on power reforms, numerous policy guidelines have 
been laid down, while the only people laughing all the way to the bank have 
been the power conference organisers. 
At the outset itself when reforms in the power sector were being ushered in, 
various sector-specific organisations, including the National Group on Power, 
as well as the media, had amply warned the various authorities, both at the 
Centre and in the States, that the path they were treading on would turn out 
to be counter-productive. For the simple reason that neither foreign nor 
private investment would venture into power generation for purposes of 
charity. On the contrary, the activity being capital- intensive, they would 
like to have assured returns as also ensure that the State electricity boards 
pay up. 
The authorities, in their zeal and drive to ensure that the reforms worked, 
paid little heed to making the SEBs bankable. And instead, the Centre was in 
a way duped to providing counter-guarantees for payment for a host of 
projects that were lined up through the memorandum of understanding (MoU) 
route. As long as the SEBs are utilised as pawns and electricity is supplied 
free to certain sectors for garnering votes, private investors will continue 
to demand guarantees such as escrow cover. 
Agreeing to that, again, is one of the surest way of choking the SEBs 
further. A classic example is the case of the Maharashtra State Electricity 
Board (MSEB) which was once one of the better SEBs financially. Despite 
repeated adverse criticism, Enron's Dabhol project was hung around MSEB'S 
neck like an albatross and the consequences have now surfaced for all to see. 
It is now that the authorities appear to have wisened up to the whole issue 
and escrow cover to Reliance's Patalganga and Ispat's Bhadravati projects are 
now being denied as the SEB cannot afford them. 
A late realisation, but better late than never. The pity is that all these 
years, the authorities had banked on private and foreign investors to make up 
for the power shortage and the public sector investment tap was literally 
turned off as a matter of policy, an act which Dr Manmohan Singh as the then 
Finance Minister had himself admitted, was faulty. 
It is time that the authorities reverted to the earlier policy of adding coal 
or gas-based generating capacity in the public sector while simultaneously 
restoring the SEBs back to health. Only then can private investment 
supplement the effort.

India: Enron: Indian lenders threaten to move court

05/08/2001
Business Line (The Hindu)
Copyright (C) 2001 Kasturi & Sons Ltd (KSL); Source: World Reporter (TM) - 
Asia Intelligence Wire

MUMBAI, May 7. INDIAN lenders to Dabhol Power Company (DPC) will not hesitate 
to drag all parties concerned - DPC, MSEB, and the Governments - to the court 
if the stalemate continues. 
"Our money is caught between two feuding parties. One (Enron) is saying that 
it does not agree with the terms of reference of the Godbole panel. The other 
(MSEB) says it cannot buy power from DPC unless offered at a lower rate. If 
these two continue their hawkish stand, we'll have no other go but sue the 
company, MSEB, and the Governments," institutional sources said.
Even though the IDBI-led consortium is "hopeful" of getting all concerned 
across the table, and talking, top officials admit that it is quite an uphill 
task. Sources told Business Line that the lenders will do everything in their 
power to find an amicable solution to the issue. The lenders are also trying 
to persuade the Union Government to play a more "active role." 
Informal talks are going on regularly between DPC, its lenders and 
shareholders. Since domestic lenders are the ones who stand to lose the most, 
they are working overtime to persuade everyone involved to amicably arrive at 
a viable settlement. 
The State Government agrees with this stance of the lending institutions. 
"Indian lenders can go to court to recover their dues," a senior State 
Government official said. 
"Foreign lenders are covered by the Union Government counter-guarantee and 
various other guarantees by the Indian financial institutions. So, a burden 
of over Rs 6,000 crore will fall on the Indian institutions. It is 
understandable if they say they will pull us to court," he said. He, however, 
insisted that it was a remote possibility. 
The official expressed concern over the Union Government's delay to nominate 
a representative for the negotiation process. The State Government, has 
selected Mr Quinton Loh, a Chinese lawyer, to represent it for arbitration 
while MSEB has appointed Mr M.L. Pendse, a former Mumbai High Court judge, he 
said. 
Enron had issued the Centre a notice of negotiation on April 4. "The process 
(negotiation) has to be completed within 60 days. A month has gone by and the 
Centre has not yet begun the process of negotiation," the official said. 
The State is, however, waiting for a resolution of the Rs 401-crore rebate 
dispute between the State electricity board and DPC. "If the matter is 
settled and MSEB's claim, that DPC should pay them Rs 401 crore as rebate, is 
vindicated, DPC will be in no position to contest on any other ground. Even 
if they lose, the monies will have to be paid and the matter will be 
resolved," he said. 
Meanwhile, a senior MSEB official said that the board would have a strong 
defence as it has been regular in its payments to the DPC. 
Interestingly, if the lenders go to court, the two feuding parties - MSEB and 
Enron - will be on the same side slugging it out with the institutions. 
"The Indian lenders can pull us to court. But we have paid, albeit under 
protest, all DPC bills regularly, except for the disputed December and 
January bills," the MSEB official said. He, however, remarked: "If the 
lenders believe going to court is a faster way to recover their money..."

Customs blocks Rs 300cr equipment of DPC
Vinu Lal

The Times of India

MUMBAI: It's a never-ending tale of woes for Enron and this time the city 
customs has played the role. The Customs department has blocked import of 
equipment belonging to Dabhol Power Company citing differences in payable 
duty. Sources informed that till date, goods worth Rs 300 crore have been 
blocked by the department. 
The bone of contention arose when the Customs department started demanding 
normal project imports duties for DPC goods, which used to be imported at 
concessional rates. The department said that the equipment imports pertaining 
to liquefied natural gas terminal, which includes goods used for setting up 
storage tank and terminals, and are not used for generating power but for a 
commercial activity. Enron officials, however, declined to comment on this 
issue.
``For a power project which involves intra-state sale of electricity, project 
equipment can be imported at concessional duties which works out to 5 per 
cent customs duty and another 16 per cent counter-vailing duty. But if 
equipment imported is being used to set up a LNG terminal for commercial 
purposes and not for generating power then the duty structure works out to 58 
per cent,'' sources said. 
The Union ministry of power had given concessional import duties for 
attracting investments in power sector, if power is sold to other states, no 
duty is applicable. For Dabhol, being an intra-state project, the customs 
duty will be 5 per cent. 
DPC is setting up a 5 million tonnes LNG facility where only 2.1 million 
tonnes will be used for the Dabhol power project and the remaining capacity 
would be sold to other customers in the region. 
At present, the civil works are on for the entire capacity which include 
three storage tanks and terminal facilities. Works on two storage tanks are 
almost complete with a sizeable work left for the third tank and similar 
works pending for the terminal, which includes the regassification project. 
Though work on the site has been going on a slow pace due to the current 
controversy, this move will also have an adverse impact on the project 
completion, sources added. 
However, sources said that the company has been demanding concessional duty 
since the LNG project is not a separate project but clubbed with the power 
project and all other benefits, like taxes, are applicable to LNG project as 
well.

BP Amoco Considers Natural-Gas Terminal in Tampa, Fla.

Reporter (TM)

TAMPA, Fla.--Energy giant BP is looking into shipping natural gas into the 
Port of Tampa, the latest plan in a race among global companies to supply 
more gas to the booming Florida market. 
An affiliate of BP has options to lease 60 acres at the tip of Hooker's Point 
for a terminal where ships three times the length of a football field would 
unload natural gas cooled into a liquid at minus 256 degrees Fahrenheit.
The project would include super-cooled storage tanks, a plant to heat the 
liquid fuel back into gas and a pipeline connecting to commercial customers, 
especially electric utilities that use gas-fired generators, the company 
says. 
Port director George Williamson says BP officials told him that the terminal 
would cost about $200-million and take at least four years to win approval 
from federal, state and local regulators. 
The company is considering several locations in North America, although Tampa 
is the only one disclosed so far, said BP spokesman Daren Beaudo in Houston. 
BP's study hasn't gone far enough to discuss construction cost estimates or 
other details, he said. 
BP paid the Tampa Port Authority $20,000 for a six-month option on the site 
and can extend the option another six months for $50,000 more. 
There are only two active liquefied natural gas terminals in the United 
States, although energy companies are working to get two others mothballed in 
1980 back into service. 
Four big energy companies, including BP, plan to build as many as seven new 
terminals in the United States, Mexico and the Caribbean, according to an 
April report by Salomon Smith Barney. 
That includes two terminals in the Bahamas designed to serve Florida. Enron 
wants to run a pipeline 90 miles that will come ashore in Broward County. El 
Paso Energy won't say how it would transport the gas to Florida. 
Forecasters at the state Public Service Commission estimate demand for 
natural gas will grow an average of 5 percent a year over the next decade. 
Energy companies and analysts say the growth could be twice that much. 
Driving demand is a bevy of new gas-fired power plants and conversions of old 
plants to run on the clean-burning fuel, said Michael Schmitz, an analyst 
with Salomon Smith Barney. Liquefied gas from Trinidad, Venezuela and 
elsewhere will be needed to augment gas piped from domestic fields, he said. 
"Many, many of these new power plants are natural gas-fired, and it's tough 
to see where the big uptick is going to come in U.S. production," Schmitz 
said. "The supply for Florida is as tight or tighter than the rest of the 
country." 
While liquefied natural gas makes up only 1 percent of the U.S. gas supply, 
it is widely used in Japan and Korea. 
BP and other companies say they've got an outstanding safety record in 
shipping and handling the material. 
Liquefied natural gas isn't combustible until it vaporizes and reaches a 
certain mixture with oxygen. The liquid isn't stored under pressure, so it 
doesn't leak quickly, BP spokesman Neil Chapman said. "It oozes," he said. 
Still, plans by Williams Gas Pipeline to reactivate its Cove Point terminal 
in Lusby, Md., has neighbors jittery. 
Schmitz thinks Enron and El Paso are building in the Bahamas to avoid tougher 
scrutiny from federal regulators and local opposition in South Florida. 
Spokesmen for the companies say various factors went into their decisions. 
Forecasters at the state Public Service Commission estimate demand for 
natural gas will grow an average of 5 percent a year over the next decade. 
The prospect of a terminal in Tampa doesn't alarm Peter Clark, executive 
director of Tampa BayWatch, an environmental group. 
He notes that ships in Tampa Bay hold a variety of hazardous cargos. Vessels 
must maintain a 1,000-yard "clear zone" from barges carrying anhydrous 
ammonia and propane. They aren't allowed to pass them in shipping channels. 
"It's a matter of being able to transport it in a safe manner," Clark said.

Enron could supply universities with state-subsidized power
By DAVID KRAVETS
Associated Press Writer

Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Enron Corp., which was ordered last month to honor its 
contracts to supply power to California's public universities, has won a key 
appellate ruling that could cost taxpayers millions. 
A federal appeals panel said the Houston-based energy wholesaler could buy 
power for the universities from the state's investor-owned utilities, rather 
than buying it on the expensive "spot" power market.
Enron says it would save the company $12 million a month. But it means the 
state will have to spend more money buying electricity to supply the 
universities. Since January, California has already spent $5 billion buying 
electricity for the customers of three ailing utilities that will eventually 
be repaid by customers and taxpayers. 
In its Thursday ruling made public Monday, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of 
Appeals overturned a federal judge's April decision that ordered Enron to 
directly supply power to most of the state's universities as part of a 
long-term agreement with them that expires in March. 
Where Enron buys that power makes a huge financial difference to the state 
under California's power deregulation rules. 
The state said it could spend - or Enron could save - up to $12 million a 
month. That's because buying last-minute power on the spot market, where 
Enron had been buying the schools' power, costs several times more than what 
the state can legally collect from ratepayers. 
Since January, the state has bought electricity for the customers of Pacific 
Gas and Electric Co., Southern California Edison Co. and San Diego Gas and 
Electric Co. in an attempt to keep them financially stable as power prices 
skyrocketed. 
The state has only been able to retrieve $1 billion from customers of the $5 
billion it has spent on electricity buys, said Nathan Barankin, a spokesman 
with the attorney general. 
The state said it would ask the court to reconsider its supply decision. The 
ruling, Barankin said, "allows Enron to perpetuate its scam on California's 
taxpayers." 
That's a position Enron vehemently denies. 
"We believe, under the way the contract is written, it gives us the right to 
supply the power or have somebody else source the power for us, such as the 
utilities," said Enron spokeswoman Peggy Mahoney. 
Enron convinced the appeals panel that it should not have to purchase power 
on the spot market to honor its contract, and instead can make good on its 
cheap power contract by buying it from the utilities. 
That means Enron will pay substantially less for the electricity through the 
utilities and will reimburse the universities for possible charges that 
exceed the contracted price with Enron. 
Electricity sold through the utilities is capped under California law and 
does not reflect the true cost of the power. Billions of dollars of 
undercollected costs is among the main reasons PG&E filed for federal 
bankruptcy protection early last month. 
The case is UC Regents v. Enron Energy Systems Inc., 01-1006.

USA: Northern Border Partners buys Midwestern Gas.

OMAHA, Neb., May 7 (Reuters) - Northern Border Partners LP said it has 
completed the acquisition of Midwestern Gas Transmission from El Paso Corp 
for about $100 million. 
The Midwestern system, a 350-mile natural gas pipeline extending from 
Portland, Tenn. to Joliet, Ill., provides interconnections to seven major 
pipeline systems in the Chicago market area, including the Northern Border 
Pipeline.
The purchase, announced in mid-March, was completed April 30 following 
approval of the Federal Trade Commission. 
Northern Border Partners owns a 70 percent general partner interest in 
Northern Border Pipeline Co., a 1,214-mile pipeline system that transports 
natural gas from the Montana-Saskatchewan border to markets in the Midwestern 
U.S. The partnership also has gathering systems and processing plants in the 
Powder River, Wind River and Williston Basins in the U.S. Rocky Mountain 
region; owns and operates processing plants and gathering pipelines in 
Alberta, Canada; and transports coal-water slurry via a pipeline in the 
Southwestern U.S. 
Northern Border Partners' general partners are units of Enron Corp. and 
Williams Cos. Inc. .

Enron Confirms DPC's Meet With Indian State Panel May 11

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- U.S. energy company Enron's (ENE) Indian unit Dabhol 
Power Co. will meet the country's Maharashtra state government's expert 
committee appointed with the objective to renegotiate the controversial power 
purchase agreement with DPC, Enron Vice President John Ambler confirmed to 
Dow Jones Newswires from Houston late Monday. 
In an online statement, Ambler who handles Enron's international public 
affairs, said: "We confirm that Dabhol Power Co. has been invited to meet 
with the recently formed negotiating committee. As a matter of courtesy we 
have agreed to meet with them (on May 11). Since the purpose of our meeting 
is to hear out the committee and understand their thoughts, we will not 
present any proposals."
"While we have constantly maintained that we are open to continuing a 
dialogue towards resolving issues, this meeting should in no manner be 
construed as an open offer from DPC to renegotiate the terms of the 
contract," he added. 
Dabhol has come under fire because of the relatively high cost of its power. 
Critics object to Dabhol charging 7.1 rupees ($1=INR46.82) a kilowatt-hour 
for its power, compared with INR1.5/kwh charged by other suppliers. 
The $3 billion, 2,184-megawatt DPC project in Maharashtra has been mired in 
financial disputes after the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, its main 
customer, failed to pay several bills. The project has the largest single 
foreign investment in India. 
As reported, a nine-member state committee headed by retired federal Home 
Secretary Madhav Godbole is working toward lowering the DPC's power tariff 
and allowing the sale of excess power to the federal government or its 
utilities. A restructuring of the DPC's stakeholding may also be on the 
agenda. The Maharashtra government has asked the committee to try to 
negotiate a revised agreement within a month. 
The DPC currently operates a 740-megawatt naphtha plant contributing about 
0.7% to India's installed capacity. Enron has maintained that work will be 
completed by the year-end in the second phase of the Dabhol project that will 
add 1,444 MW to its capacity. The plant will switch from naphtha to liquefied 
natural gas as a fuel source in 2002. 
Texas-based Enron has a 65% stake in the DPC and is the project's largest 
shareholder. Other shareholders include the MSEB with 15%, and General 
Electric Co. (GE) and Bechtel Enterprises (X.BTL) with 10% each.

BANDWIDTH BEAT: Master Trading Agreement 3.0

04/16/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

. By Michael Rieke 
. A Dow Jones Newswires Column . 

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Carriers and trading companies worked for more than 
nine months last year, missed four deadlines and couldn't produce a master 
bandwidth trading agreement.
Now they seem to be coming out with something new every other month or so. 
Since mid-December, two master trading agreements have been posted on the 
Competitive Telecommunications Association Web site, and there's a third one 
circulating. Who's behind it, however, is a mystery. 
The first thing to understand in a discussion of master trading agreements 
for the bandwidth market is that few, if any, sources want to be quoted on 
the subject. 
Enron Corp. (ENE) and Williams Communications Group (WCG) are about the only 
companies willing to have their names attached to a trading contract. But 
it's safe to assume that at least El Paso Corp. (EPG), Utilicorp United Inc. 
(UCU) unit Aquila, Koch Industries and Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) worked with 
Enron on first contract. Universal Access Inc. (UAXS) and unnamed carriers 
are said to have worked with Williams on the second. 
The new contract is being referred to in the market as the "Universal Access" 
contract. 
"This is not a Universal Access contract," Pam Whitehead, vice president of 
global bandwidth markets for Universal Access, told Bandwidth Beat. Her 
company was one of about 10 carriers that worked on the third contract, she 
said. 
When asked for a copy of the third contract, Whitehead referred Bandwidth 
Beat to CompTel, saying she was sure the group had a copy. 
Another source, when asked for a copy of the third contract, said, "Why don't 
you talk to Pam? It's her document." Less Firm Or More Flexible? 

The third contract is "less firm" than the other two contracts, people in the 
trading market said. But a person who worked on it described it in a way that 
makes it sound more flexible than the other two. 
"It does have a check box on the front that allows you to totally opt out of 
the firmness that's described (in the contract), said the source. "But if you 
don't check that box, it's completely firm." 
Firm contracts leave parties liable for damages if the terms aren't met, and 
trading companies say bandwidth has to be traded on a firm basis for the 
market to work. Carriers, on the other hand, say the best-efforts basis on 
which they've always done business should be fine for bandwidth trading as 
well. 
This split has frustrated attempts to create a common contract. But the whole 
debate over firm versus best-efforts is at least a little bogus. 
Despite traders' hard-line position, there's always room for flexibility in 
markets. When Enron buys natural gas, it doesn't always use a firm contract. 
If it's going to resell the gas under an interruptible - or best-efforts - 
contract, it doesn't need to buy with a firm contract. 
In the winter, when delivery of gas is crucial, 95% of the business is done 
with firm contracts, a veteran gas trader told Bandwidth Beat. In the summer, 
when delivery isn't so crucial, 75% of the business is done with firm 
contracts. Special Deals No One Talks About 

When carriers say they've always done business on a best-efforts basis, 
they're not telling the whole truth either. Case in point are individual case 
basis, or ICB, contracts. 
ICB contracts aren't standardized. A buyer can get just about anything in an 
ICB deal, including firm delivery, but the buyer can't tell anyone about it. 
The arrangements are private and confidential. 
So who can get ICB contracts? It's determined by how much a buyer is 
spending, how much he knows about the market and how good he is at 
negotiating, Ron Harden, director and chief operating officer of PointOne 
Telecommunications in Austin, Texas, told Bandwidth Beat. 
"You can always get an ICB deal if you push them hard and ... if you know 
where the market is priced," he said. 
So energy traders don't always do business on a firm basis, and carriers 
don't always do business on a best-efforts basis. 
But there's no arguing that fact that trading with a firm contract makes any 
market, including the telecom market, more efficient. Buyers need to know 
when their crucial orders will be filled. 
Now let's go back to the fact that, at least on the carriers side of the 
argument, companies don't want their names associated with the effort to 
produce a standard trading agreement. 
The reluctance stems from internal and external concerns. Carriers' 
traditional sales staff fear bandwidth trading could cause them to lose 
customers and bonuses to their company's bandwidth trading desk. And carriers 
hoping to do business with both other carriers and trading companies don't 
want to endanger their relations with either group. 
But Jon Merriman, president and chief executive of RateXchange Corp. (RTX), 
has predicted that carriers won't always shy from being mentioned in 
connection with bandwidth trading. Sometime soon a telecom analyst will put a 
buy rating on a carrier that uses the bandwidth market to sell unused network 
capacity and increase its revenues, giving companies an incentive to open up, 
Merriman said. 
We'll see how long that takes.

Sierra Pacific Shares Slump After Utility Suspends Dividend
By Elena Molinari

04/16/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Dow Jones Newswires 
NEW YORK --- Interpreting Sierra Pacific Resources' suspension of its 
dividend payment as a sign of poor financial health, investors sold off 
shares of the utility on Monday.
At 4 p.m., shares of Sierra Pacific (SRP) were off $1.21, or 8.3%, to $13.29 
after earlier falling by as much as 12% in New York Stock Exchange trading. 
Sierra Pacific, which owns two Nevada utilities, said last week it cancelled 
the dividend payment scheduled for May 1. The company cited high power costs 
and other fallout from the energy crisis afflicting the western part of the 
U.S. 
The move will save the Reno, Nev.-based utility less than $20 million, it 
said. The dividend policy will be reviewed at the next board meeting May 21, 
the company added. 
Sierra Pacific has paid a quarterly dividend of 25 cents a share in recent 
quarters. 
Caught between regulated retail electric prices and rising wholesale energy 
costs, Sierra Pacific's situation is similar to that of California utility 
PG&E Corp., which filed for bankruptcy protection on April 6. 
"The company's earnings in the past few quarters have been hurt severely by 
the high cost of wholesale electric power," said Barry Abramson, an analyst 
with UBS Warburg. "Even though the company has been allowed to gradually 
increase its retail electric rates each month, these rate hikes have not kept 
up with the cost of power." 
Sierra Pacific received relief in February when the Nevada Public Utilities 
Commission approved a 17 percent rate increase, equal to about $300 million 
of additional revenue. 
The company said it still hopes to complete a $2 billion agreement to 
purchase Enron Corp.'s Portland General Electric unit. The transaction, which 
will also include the assumption of $1 billion in debt, has been delayed 
partly because of a new California law that has blocked Sierra Pacific from 
raising funds through planned sales of certain power-generating assets.

Energy Traders Raise Ante In Power-hungry California

04/16/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK (AP)--In Houston, it's known as "the power corner." Separated by 
just a few city blocks, four major power wholesalers run trading exchanges 
that have a strong influence on energy prices nationwide. 
The trading floors run by Enron Corp. (ENE), Reliant Energy Inc. (REI), 
Dynegy Inc. (DYN) and Duke Energy Corp. (DUK) represent ground zero in a 
power crisis threatening the quality of life in much of the western United 
States this summer.
By seizing upon opportunities created by deregulation, the energy traders 
have turned up the juice in the electricity business in ways similar to how 
junk bond traders ignited Wall Street in the 1980s and venture capitalists 
fueled Silicon Valley last decade. 
And thanks to an exemption granted in the early 1990s, nobody monitors daily 
trading to detect unfair or illegal practices. 
Utility bills in California have gone up nearly fourfold in the past year, to 
$27.1 billion. Without fundamental changes in the energy market, this year's 
bill will rise to $70 billion -more than $2,000 for every person in the 
state, according to operators of the state's power grid. 
The staggering electricity price increases have pushed the state's largest 
utility, Pacific Gas and Electric, into bankruptcy and left No. 2 Southern 
California Edison on the brink of insolvency. California's once-ample budget 
surplus also has shriveled, as the state is spending about $50 million a day 
to buy enough power to keep the lights on. 
The energy wholesalers say they're doing nothing wrong. 
They blame the high prices on the rising price of natural gas, burned to 
generate electricity, and the state's botched deregulation plan. By failing 
to line up reliable power ahead of time and by imposing price caps for 
consumers, the state put itself into this mess, the companies say. 
"There have been accusations of wrongdoing for eight months now and there 
isn't a shred of evidence to support the allegations," said Gary Ackerman, 
executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, a Menlo Park, Calif., 
trade group. "People are very angry and frustrated about electricity right 
now and attorneys are trying to take that anger out on us." 

Anti-trust Probes 

Attorneys general in Washington, Oregon and California are probing whether 
the wholesalers have violated antitrust laws or engaged in unfair business 
practices. A California state senate committee may issue subpoenas for 
records and the testimony of top energy executives, and at least five 
lawsuits accuse energy companies of market abuses. 
"This is the best fraud I have ever seen," attorney Michael Aguirre of San 
Diego, who is involved in one of the class-action suits. "The generators are 
doing everything that you think that they might be doing, only it's worse 
than you ever imagined." 
The lawsuits and investigations allege that generators have conspired to 
hijack billions of dollars from consumers and taxpayers by withholding 
electricity from energy-starved California until the last minute, and then 
supplying it at exorbitant prices. 
At Enron's headquarters in Houston, energy specialists among the company's 
1,500 traders swap electricity and natural gas contracts like stocks and 
bonds. Mathematicians, meteorologists and economists make complex 
calculations to identify where to buy the cheapest power and where to deliver 
it at the greatest profit. 
"They are extremely good at what they do," said Severin Borenstein, director 
of the University of California at Berkeley's energy institute. 
The Internet has provided the traders with the tools to do their jobs even 
better. Online marketplaces and password-protected exchanges provide them 
with invaluable real-time information on the buying and selling patterns of 
their rivals. 
Two lawsuits allege that traders have parlayed the sensitive information 
collected online to fix prices artificially high, a violation of antitrust 
laws. 
Aguirre has spent six months assembling reams of data about traders and their 
activities, but he has yet to develop concrete evidence to prove his 
price-fixing allegations. 

A March 21 report by California's electricity grid managers concluded that, 
between last May and November, 98% of trading bids were driven up by 
noncompetitive patterns of behavior. 
The California Independent System Operator report stopped short of accusing 
wholesalers of illegal market manipulation, but it did determine that the 
wholesalers collected as much as $6.9 billion in "unjust and unreasonable" 
rates. 
Enron says its trading system, particularly the online exchange, has resulted 
in fairer and more efficient markets. The allegations of market abuse are 
"just some sour grapes from people who didn't come up with the idea in the 
first place," said Enron spokesman Eric Thode. 
The online exchanges and other industry Web sites provide the energy traders 
with a window to see the energy availability and bids in markets around the 
country. 
Power industry critics, however, contend the Web's instant access provides 
the traders a way to exploit a delicate supply-demand balance. If the scale 
is tipped even slightly toward an inadequate supply, they say, prices soar 
and energy traders reap huge gains. 
"The whole trading thing is just a front that lets them game the market," 
Aguirre said. "They can get away with it because no one (outside the 
industry) can figure out what they are doing." 
Whatever the energy traders are doing, it's not closely monitored by 
government regulators. 

Blanket CFTC Exemption 

In 1993, the trading of energy products received an exemption from oversight 
by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a federal agency that oversees 
commodity and options trading to protect markets from fraud and manipulation. 
Energy is the only commodity that has received a blanket CFTC exemption. 
The exemption was shepherded beginning in 1992 by then-CFTC chairwoman Wendy 
Gramm, wife of Texas Sen. Phil Gramm. She left the CFTC three months before 
the exemption received final approval in 1993. That same year, she joined the 
Enron board of directors, a post that last year earned her $50,000. 
Gramm, an economist at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, said 
she doesn't recall talking with Enron about the exemption, which she 
characterized as a routine matter triggered by an antitrust case involving 
crude oil. 
"It really didn't have anything to do with Enron or any specific company," 
said Gramm. "It had to do with a general market problem." 
In granting the exemption, the CFTC accepted the industry's contention that 
it shouldn't be subjected to the government's usual commodities regulation 
because its markets are dominated by "large sophisticated commercial 
entities" capable of protecting themselves - in short, that there would be no 
little people to hurt. 
At the time, then-CFTC commissioner Sheila Bair scoffed at the reasoning, 
comparing energy traders to boiler room sales operations that had the 
potential to violate federal anti-fraud laws. 
"Is it really that much of burden on market participants (for the CFTC) to 
retain a sliver of authority regarding fraudulent activity?" Bair wrote in a 
dissenting opinion. 
Wholesale electricity prices negotiated by the traders are eventually 
compiled in quarterly reports and reviewed by the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission. And while FERC by law is supposed to prevent unfair prices, a 
majority of its commissioners have advocated a hands-off approach to 
California's energy crisis, insisting that the market can correct itself. 
That posture may finally be changing somewhat. On Wednesday in San Jose, 
Calif., FERC chairman Curt Hebert told lawmakers that his agency hopes to 
begin "monitoring and mitigating" the wholesale electricity market by May 1. 
This could allow FERC to preemptively influence prices. 
Energy economists who have studied the market see signs of ruthless, but 
perfectly legal, behavior. 
Paul Joskow, an MIT economist, concluded in January that electricity 
producers deliberately withheld power to drive up prices. 
"Every business exercises market power when it can, so I don't know why 
people are so surprised that (the generators) used their market power," 
Joskow said. "I didn't see any evidence of collusion in what they did ... It 
was just good business." 
Enron's specific trading methods remain a mystery even to industry analysts, 
partly because the company considers its techniques to be proprietary. But it 
yielded a big payoff last year - an operating profit of $1.6 billion, up 160% 
from $628 million in 1999. 
When electricity and natural gas prices soared to record highs in the fourth 
quarter, Enron's trading profit more than tripled to $538 million. 
Without providing specifics, Enron officials said the profits poured in from 
all over the country. 
"Our success is linked to efficient markets, not higher prices in California, 
or anywhere else for that matter," Steve Kean, an Enron executive vice 
president, said in January testimony before the U.S. Senate. "What we are 
interested in is competitive and well-functioning markets. Our financial 
success is not built on California's back."

Independent Power Producers Expect to Meet or Exceed Forecasts
By Kaja Whitehouse

04/16/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Dow Jones Newswires 
NEW YORK -- Prepare for stellar earnings among independent power producers 
this quarter, because it is no surpise higher energy prices have fattened 
their first-quarter numbers.
A number of electricity generators already have raised their earnings 
forecasts to almost twice last year's numbers, resting fears that problems in 
California would drag down earnings figures. Underlying growth has been 
widening profits on volatile trades of electricity contracts. 
The contracts, which trade like a commodity on the spot market, have been 
fetching high prices as demand for electricity outpaces supply. Trading 
volumes also have contributed to pumped-up prices because such contracts can 
change hands several times before they actually end up with a retail 
customer. 
Strong natural-gas prices also should buoy the group's earnings this quarter. 
In January, power producers were able to fetch $10 per million British 
thermal units, or BTUs, on wholesale natural-gas prices. While that number 
has since fallen to around $5.50, it is still well above January 2000 levels 
of about $3 per BTU. 
Williams Cos. (WMB), Calpine Corp. (CPN), Dynegy Inc. (DYN) and Mirant Corp. 
(MIR) are among those expecting first-quarter numbers to exceed analysts' 
expectations. Enron Corp. (ENE) and Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) have assured 
investors they are on track to meet fiscal 2001 earnings views. 
Before the slew of positive preannouncements, investors worried the group's 
earnings might be dragged down by California's hurting utilities. The 
utilities have been unable to pay for electricity supplied by the generators, 
citing legislation preventing them from passing those costs to consumers. 
Analyst Plays Down Risk From California Problems

Neal Dingman, analyst at , is among those who are dismissing the California 
risks for the first quarter. The generators shouldn't write off money owed by 
California yet because they largely expect to recoup it at "some point down 
the line," he said. The generators have been building cash reserves to 
cushion potential losses while they wait for a solution. 
"In the worst case scenario, (power producers) wouldn't get paid 100 cents on 
the dollar," but it's still too early to tell if that will happen, he said. 
Earlier this month, it seemed investors' worst fears were realized when PG&E 
Corp.'s (PCG) Pacific Gas & Electric Co. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy 
protection. But a number of generators smoothed concerns by saying the 
bankruptcy would have no effect on their numbers. 
Earlier Monday, Reliant Energy reported net income of $262.5 million, or 90 
cents a diluted share, up from $133 million, or 47 cents a share, a year 
earlier. Revenue soared to $13.3 billion from $4.21 billion. 
Earnings from continuing operations came to $208.2 million, or 72 cents a 
share, two cents better than analysts' expectations, according to a survey by 
Thomson Financial/First Call. 
At the time Pacific Gas & Electric filed bankruptcy, Reliant assured 
investors the filing wouldn't reduce its first-quarter results. In fact, the 
company, which is owed about $370 million for power sold in California, said 
the filing was merely a means to getting the company's receivables paid. 
Pacific Gas' bankruptcy filing also pushed Calpine to say it wouldn't alter 
its full-year earnings guidance. Two weeks before the Pacific Gas bankruptcy 
filing, Calpine boosted its full-year 2001 guidance to $1.80 a share from 
$1.50. 
As of March 31, Calpine recorded about $267 million in money owed by Pacific 
Gas & Electric, plus a $68 million note receivable. Calpine is still 
considering how it will treat these debts on its first-quarter financial 
results. Unlike the other power producers, Calpine didn't reserve any cash to 
cover unpaid debts. 
Some analysts have said Calpine may have to take charges in coming months if 
the Pacific Gas debts aren't paid. But most agree that the charges wouldn't 
affect the first quarter. Analysts expect Calpine to post earnings of 23 
cents a share, three times last year's seven cents a share but below last 
quarter's 34 cents a share. Refunds Could Hurt Future Quarters

The group seems to have escaped a looming first-quarter concern over demands 
that some of the hefty profits made on trades in times of low supply be 
returned. Earlier last month, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
ordered 13 power producers to either justify the steep prices they charged in 
California or refund million of dollars to the utilities. 
Hardest hit were Dynegy and Williams, which are fighting orders to refund 
$45.8 million and $29.6 million, respectively. But even in the midst of 
troubles with FERC, the companies raised their first-quarter forecasts above 
Wall Street estimates. 
Citing improved performance in energy trading and gas exploration, Williams 
said it expects first-quarter earnings of between 65 cents and 75 cents a 
share. 
Dynegy raised its outlook for the quarter to 40 cents a share, citing success 
in its core convergence business. 
Barry Abramson, analyst at UBS Warburg, is among those who think refunds on 
the overcharges aren't severe enough to dramatically hurt future earnings. 
"This is still a small portion of the money made out of California," he said. 
"It's a small risk." 
Only Dominion Resources Inc. (D) of Richmond, Va., is considered safe from 
California's price wars because it focuses on the Eastern states. Analysts 
expect the company to earn $1.14 a share for the quarter, only 10 cents a 
share above last year. 
Analysts predict Mirant Corp. (MIR) will post 47 cents a share for the 
quarter. The company anticipates earnings in the range of 46 cents a share to 
48 cents, compared with earnings of 28 cents a share a year earlier. 
Enron, however, hasn't provided guidance for the first quarter, but sees an 
"outstanding quarter" because gas and power trading volumes are up. The 
company, which earned 40 cents a share in the year-earlier quarter, sees 
full-year 2001 earnings of 45 cents a share. 
While the generators will likely brush aside the risks of California in the 
first-quarter, some suspect troubles could catch up to them in months to 
come. 
The imbalance between supply and demand in an unregulated market has boosted 
the generators' profits, but whether they will continue to roam free remains 
to be seen. There is still the risk that FERC may cap wholesale prices to 
appease California legislators, and there also is the potential for 
California to seize low-cost electricity contracts to control what they see 
as an outrageous market. 
"It is a positive story, but there is still that black cloud out there until 
these issues can be cleared," Dain Rauscher's Mr. Dingman said.

Seattle City Utility Racks Up $92 Million in Power Purchases in March
Jim Brunner

04/16/2001
KRTBN Knight-Ridder Tribune Business News: The Seattle Times - Washington
Copyright (C) 2001 KRTBN Knight Ridder Tribune Business News; Source: World 
Reporter (TM)

Seattle City Light spent a record $92 million buying power on the market in 
March, more than any month in its 91-year history. 
City Light officials say the cost of buying power for local residents and 
businesses eclipsed the previous records -- $84 million set in February and 
nearly $80 million in January.
To put that in perspective: In 1999, before the current power crisis, the 
utility's total power bill for the entire year was $90 million. "We're 
spending that every month now. The dollars that are involved are staggering," 
said Paula Green, deputy superintendent of City Light. 
It's a cash hemorrhage brought on by Washington's drought, which means less 
water in the reservoirs at city-owned dams. That increases Seattle's need to 
purchase electricity on a market where prices have zoomed to unprecedented 
levels. 
Adding to the frustration for Seattle city officials is the fact that most of 
that money is flowing to out-of-state utilities and power brokers who are 
profiting enormously from the energy crunch. 
Last month alone, the bill from Enron, a Houston-based corporation, was $25.5 
million, putting it well ahead of the No. 2 seller, California's Sempra 
Energy, which sold $7.4 million worth of electricity to City Light. 
City Light still gets most of the 1,200 megawatts necessary to serve its load 
from city-owned dams and from its contract with the Bonneville Power 
Administration (BPA). The utility buys only about 15 percent of its power on 
the market. But that thin slice now accounts for more than 90 percent of its 
power costs. 
Part of the explanation for March's record power-buying binge was City 
Light's recent decision to store up extra water behind Ross Dam on the Skagit 
River instead of spilling it through the dam's power turbines. 
In a normal water year, City Light officials would be spilling water for 
energy and expecting it would be replaced with spring runoff. Now, they're 
saving the water so it can be spilled later to help salmon runs and to 
generate power for Seattle this summer, when energy prices are expected to 
surge even higher, to more than $400 per megawatt hour. 
"We're insulating ourselves. By putting out one eye now, we're avoiding 
cutting off our head later," said Bob Royer, City Light spokesman. 
Seattle ratepayers are feeling the pain, with a 28 percent City Light rate 
increase so far this year. More rate increases are likely on the way. 
Higher rates have also led to plant closures and layoffs in Bellingham and 
Spokane. 
Meanwhile, Enron's revenues more than doubled last year, to $101 billion. Its 
stock prices surged to end the year at $88 a share, up from $44 the year 
before. The stock was trading at $57 a share last week. 
"It doesn't just feel unfair, but immoral that these major companies like 
Enron are making billions of dollars at the expense of everyday people and 
businesses," said City Councilwoman Heidi Wills, who chairs the Council's 
Energy and Environmental Policy Committee. 
"There's this enormous transfer of wealth from our ratepayers to the 
shareholders of these companies," Wills said. 
Northwest leaders have called for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to 
impose price caps. But opponents say price caps would do nothing to encourage 
the construction of new power plants, or energy conservation. 
Karen Denne, an Enron spokeswoman, said it's unfair to fault the company for 
selling power at prices dictated by the free market. "Enron is providing 
electricity to a market that needs it," Denne said. "It's unfortunate when 
regulators are pointing fingers, looking to fix blame, when this is a problem 
of supply and demand." 
The company hails from President George W. Bush's home state of Texas, and is 
one of the top "soft money" donors to political campaigns. Enron and its 
executives gave $435,000 to the Democrats and $1.2 million to Republicans 
last year, according to Common Cause. 
Its chairman, Kenneth Lay, has consistently been one of the top donors to 
Bush's presidential and gubernatorial campaigns. 
Enron doesn't own a lot of dams or power plants. Instead, the company makes 
money as a middleman -- buying power from utilities and then reselling it for 
a profit. The company, formed in 1985 from the merger of two pipeline 
companies, has become the largest trader of wholesale electricity in North 
America. 
Part of its success in the energy market stems from its groundbreaking use of 
the Internet to make buying electricity as easy as ordering a book online. 
You just point, click and spend. 
"It's easier than Amazon," said Steve Lewis, a power marketer with City 
Light, demonstrating the company's Web site. It lists available power 
"products" and the asking price for both buyers and sellers. 
Lewis and other power marketers monitor City Light's projected power needs 
and then use the phone or Internet to schedule electricity for the next hour, 
next day or months ahead. They try to find the best price available, but it's 
clearly a sellers' market. 
Utilities routinely buy power that used to cost $30 per megawatt hour for 
more than $200. At times last month, City Light was buying power for $450 a 
megawatt hour. And it's not because the cost of generation has gone up. 
"This is pure profit," said Green, deputy superintendent of City Light. 
There is evidence that the Northwest is in some ways being hit even harder 
than California, whose experiment with deregulation is blamed for roiling the 
power markets. A recent analysis found that Pacific Northwest utilities are 
paying the highest prices in the nation for the next-day delivery of 
wholesale power. 
However, regional utilities also sell power for extraordinarily high prices. 
In fact, some of the highest average prices paid by City Light last month 
were to neighbors. 
Puget Sound Energy, Western Washington's largest electric utility, charged 
City Light the highest average price of any seller last month, at $303 per 
megawatt hour, according to City Light's preliminary billing estimates. 
Spokane's Avista Energy charged $281. 
That compares with Enron's average price of $173 per megawatt hour and an 
overall average of $194. 
The BPA, by comparison, charges City Light $22 per megawatt hour. 
City Light typically relies on local utilities more when it needs power 
delivered immediately. And prices for short-term deals can be higher 
depending on the time of day. The city has only a long-term contract with the 
BPA. 
Despite the record-setting month, city officials hope they'll be in better 
shape before the year is out. Mayor Paul Schell has taken to calling Oct. 1 
Seattle's "energy independence day" because that's when the city will begin 
receiving more hydroelectric power under a new contract with the BPA. 
The historically cheap BPA power, combined with a contract with a gas-fired 
power plant in Klamath Falls, Ore., should reduce the city's reliance on the 
open market, city officials say. 
But the BPA, too, has been stricken by higher market power costs and may have 
to increase its rates to City Light by 250 percent. The City Council has 
already agreed to pass those higher costs on to Seattle ratepayers although 
it's unclear how much that would raise the bill of the average person. 
Even at a higher rate, City Light officials regard the BPA power as a good 
long-term strategy for getting power costs under control. If they succeed, 
the rate increases approved this year could eventually be rescinded. 
Until then, local ratepayers will have to keep writing bigger checks to City 
Light with the knowledge that some of their money will find its way to Texas.

Sierra Pacific Shares Fall After Dividend Canceled (Update2)

Sierra Pacific Shares Fall After Dividend Canceled (Update2)

    (Updates with closing share price. For more on the California
electricity crisis, see {EXTRA <GO>}.)

     Reno, Nevada, April 16 (Bloomberg) -- Sierra Pacific
Resources shares fell 8.3 percent after the owner of Nevada's two
largest utilities canceled its May quarterly dividend because it
may need the money to buy electricity.
     Shares of Reno, Nevada-based Sierra Pacific fell $1.21 to
$13.29. They've dropped 17 percent this year.
     Sierra Pacific, which sold power plants last year to win
regulatory approval of the merger that created the company, has
lost ``hundreds of millions of dollars'' buying power at prices it
can't pass on to customers, Chief Financial Officer Mark Ruelle
said Friday. He declined to be more specific.
     Nevada regulators allowed the company's utilities to raise
rates by 17 percent in February, though the increase won't end
losses, Ruelle said.
     The company, which has more than 300,000 customers in Nevada
and California, has paid a quarterly dividend of 25 cents since it
was created in the July 1999 merger of Sierra Pacific Resources
Inc. and Nevada Power Co. It lost $18.2 million, or 23 cents a
share, in the fourth quarter because of the surge in power prices.
     The average price of electricity in the west rose more than
ninefold last quarter from a year ago.

                        Nevada Legislation

     The Nevada legislature is considering letting the company
recover debt by keeping rates high after power costs drop, Sierra
Pacific spokeswoman Faye Andersen said. The measure also would
block Sierra Resources from selling a 14 percent stake in the
Mohave coal-fired power plant in Laughlin, Nevada, Andersen said.
     Sierra Pacific had agreed to sell its Mohave stake to
Arlington, Virginia-based AES Corp. to win regulatory approval for
its $3.1 billion purchase of Portland General Electric from
Houston-based Enron Corp.
     The sale of Portland General, which has 700,000 customers in
Portland, Oregon, was stalled in January after California
regulators barred utilities from selling generators until 2006
because of the state's energy crisis. Southern California Edison
had agreed to sell its 56 percent stake in the Mohave plant to AES
as part of a joint transaction with Sierra Pacific.
     Southern California Edison, California's second-biggest
utility, is owned by Rosemead-based Edison International. Edison
agreed last week to sell its power-transmission lines to the state
for $2.76 billion to avoid bankruptcy. Edison has $5.4 billion in
losses from buying power at prices far exceeding what it could
charge customers.

	Friday, April 6, 2001 




By Rick Stouffer 
rstouffer@ftenergy.com 

Pacific Gas & Electric Co., saddled with $9 billion in wholesale power costs 
it could not collect and with costs increasing by $300 million per month, 
filed Friday for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. 
Bankruptcy Code.

Under Chapter 11, the utility unit of PG&E Corp. will be given time to 
reorganize its precarious financial situation, including the restructuring of 
its massive debt. The filing in no way impacts PG&E or its other 
subsidiaries, including National Energy Group. 

"We believe filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection is the best 
alternative to protect the legal rights of Pacific Gas & Electric and to 
allow us to continue serving our (13 million) customers," said Pacific Gas & 
Electric Chairman Robert D. Glynn Jr., during a Friday teleconference. 


Four primary reasons for filing
In a teleconference on Friday April 6, Glynn listed four primary reasons for 
filing for Chapter 11, including: 

Failure by California to assume the full procurement responsibility for the 
utility's "net open position," which the company said was provided for. This 
resulted in Pacific Gas & Electric continuing to be exposed to purchase costs 
totaling an estimated $300 million-plus per month. 
"We don't actually know how much we owe the DWR (California Department of 
Water Resources) or the ISO (California Independent System Operator), because 
they've never told us," Glynn said. 

Actions taken by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) on March 
27 and April 3, which Pacific Gas & Electric said created new payment 
obligations and undermined its ability to return to financial viability. 
Those actions included mandating Pacific Gas & Electric pay the full amount 
of the bills presented by qualifying facilities, and that the utility "pay 
out more in cash to DWR than we collect in rates," according to Glynn. 

Lack of any progress in negotiations between the company and the state 
concerning the $9 billion in excess wholesale power costs spent since last 
June. 
"Talks were going nowhere; we would reach agreements that were then not 
followed up on," Glynn said. "We've heard a lot of words come out of 
Sacramento, but the challenge was to follow up with action." 

The adoption by the CPUC of what Pacific Gas & Electric called an illegal and 
retroactive accounting change that would appear to eliminate the company's 
uncollected wholesale costs. 
The CPUC ruled that the utilities offset their wholesale power costs against 
the transition costs collected from ratepayers. 

The order also requires the utilities to offset their operating costs with 
the money they make from selling power from their own generating units during 
the rate freeze. The companies believe that if the order isn't changed, they 
could not recover past purchased power expenses. 

PG&E PROFILE SPREADSHEET

Many not surprised
Analysts for the most part were not surprised that Pacific Gas & Electric 
took Friday's action, many saying they had expected a filing weeks ago. 

"I always believed this was the smartest way to deal with this debacle," said 
Bill LeBlanc, vice president of retail consulting for Boulder, Colorado 
research and consulting firm E Source*the retail-energy wing of FT Energy. "I 
expect Southern California Edison to follow suit; I had actually expected 
these utilities to file Chapter 11 about eight weeks ago." 

LeBlanc said he expected a Chapter 11 filing, because California will not 
bail out the utilities, and they have no way to recover costs in an 
expeditious manner in what they believe is economically fair to their 
corporation and customers. 

Governor's acquiescence didn't help
Even a short press conference Thursday by California Gov. Gray Davis, in 
which he finally admitted a rate hike was needed, and his proposal to provide 
as much as $8 billion in bonds to pay the utilities' past power costs, could 
not deter Pacific Gas & Electric's filing. 

The governor's words had little effect on Glynn. "Did we hear the governor's 
speech last night? We heard a lot of words, but we have not seen the 
actions," Glynn told his teleconference audience. 

"Almost every day since this crisis began, we have looked at staying out of 
bankruptcy, vs. entering bankruptcy," Glynn said. "We expect the court to 
provide the venue needed to reach a solution which the state and regulators 
have been unable to achieve." 

"This (bankruptcy filing) really wasn't unexpected; this company has been 
making noise like this for weeks," said Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein energy 
analyst Linda Byus. "The governor probably expected that he made a big noise 
last night with his announcement, but these guys said no, not really." 

"It's a very unfortunate situation, extremely complicated," according to 
Jeffrey Holzschuh, managing director and head of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter's 
Global Energy Group. "There are just so many people involved in this that I 
don't think you can come to conclusion quickly or easily." 

Judge holds the power
What bankruptcy offers is a utility "czar," a court judge with virtually 
unlimited power, legal scholars said. The judge will hold the situation in 
his or her hands*and the governor, shareholders and consumers be darned. 

"Bottom line is the judge has total control," according to Robert Nachtmann, 
professor of finance and executive associate dean of the Katz Graduate School 
of Business at the University of Pittsburgh. 

Preservation of the utility's assets is first and foremost in the judge's 
eyes*doing what needs to be done to keep the company operational. 

Who loses? 
Who loses? In particular, the power producers that have been vilified by 
Glynn and his counterpart at SoCal Ed will lose*as well as Gov. Davis. 
However, in reality, just about everyone in the state of California will 
suffer. 

Stocks of power wholesalers, including Duke Energy, Dynegy Corp., Williams 
Cos. Inc. and Reliant Energy Inc. immediately swooned once word spread 
concerning Pacific Gas & Electric's filing. 

"Creditors, including the state, wholesalers, equipment vendors, etc. will 
take something of a financial hit*probably get back something like 50 cents 
to 75 cents on the dollar for what they are owed," according to John Egan, E 
Source's director, strategic & marketing issues. 

Shareholders will be the big losers; typically they will be wiped out, Egan 
said. 

Glynn said he did not know how long the process would take, but expect it to 
be long and extremely costly. The University of Pittsburgh's Nachtmann said 
the average time frame for bankruptcy for a publicly traded entity is about 
30 months. 

Huge monetary cost
As for cost, the 1992 to 1996 bankruptcy of El Paso Electric Co. cost an 
estimated $100 million*and that was for a company many times smaller than the 
behemoth Pacific Gas & Electric. 

One thing is for sure: The problems and trials in the California energy 
market will only continue. 

"This will continue daily, weekly, hourly for the foreseeable future," Morgan 
Stanley's Holzschuh said.

Energy supply setback: Big generator can't be forced to sell emergency power 
to the state, a U.S. court rules.
By Denny Walsh and Carrie Peyton
BEE STAFF WRITERS
(Published April 6, 2001) 
In a development that does not bode well for California's energy supply, a 
federal appellate court Thursday halted enforcement of a lower court order 
that a big electricity generator must sell emergency power to the state 
without guarantee of payment. 
State energy officials said the ruling wouldn't have any immediate effect but 
could precipitate a power emergency if the generator decided to take a plant 
off-line for maintenance. 
On March 21, citing "rolling blackouts (that have) darkened the California 
landscape," U.S. District Judge Frank C. Damrell Jr. imposed an injunction 
against Reliant Energy Services Inc., one of the nation's major generators. 
Houston-based Reliant controls approximately 3,800 megawatts, or about 20 
percent, of the gas-fired generation capacity in the state, and Damrell found 
that loss of that production "poses an imminent threat." 
But Thursday, a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals 
granted an emergency stay of the injunction, saying Reliant has shown "a high 
likelihood of success on the merits" of its appeal. 
While not spelling it out, the panel apparently bases its finding on the 
question of the courts' jurisdiction over the energy market. The panel 
directed that a hearing on the appeal be scheduled for the second week in 
July. 
The decision leaves California's electric grid more fragile, at least 
temporarily, according to the state Independent System Operator, which 
maintains and controls power transmissions. 
It gives the agency no immediate recourse if Reliant chooses to shut down any 
of its plants for maintenance, said ISO Vice President Jim Detmers. 
"It's not going to change anything overnight, and it's not going to change 
anything over the weekend," said Detmers. "But if Reliant decided on a 
unilateral action to take their units off for maintenance ... we definitely 
could have a system emergency." 
Reliant officials, when told of the ruling, took a conciliatory tone but 
declined to specify their next move. 
"Reliant ... has pledged to keep the lights on in California," said company 
lobbyist Marty Wilson, and "is still of a mind to want to cooperate." 
Without further comment, the appeals court judges cited a 1980 U.S. District 
Court decision. In that case, 14 cities sued Florida Power and Light Co., 
alleging that it was violating a number of laws in its sales of power and 
production of electricity. 
The judge found, however, that the Federal Power Act reserves oversight of 
interstate utilities exclusively to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
He ruled that only the commission may bring an action involving energy sales 
into federal court -- unless it is a request to review a commission order, 
and that goes directly to an appellate court. 
The lawsuit before Damrell was brought by the ISO to force Reliant and two 
other generators to respond to ISO's emergency orders for power, even though 
the agency is buying on behalf of two retailers that are broke and hopelessly 
in debt. 
Because Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison can't pay 
their bills -- about $14 billion -- some wholesalers want to cut off sales to 
the utilities. 
The other three defendants in the ISO's suit -- Dynegy Power Corp. of Houston 
and Tulsa-based AES Corp. and its marketer, Williams Energy Marketing & 
Trading Co. -- have entered into written agreements with ISO to continue 
supplying emergency power until the FERC decides whether they are required to 
sell to companies that are not creditworthy. 
But Charles Robinson, ISO general counsel, points out that the generators can 
rescind those agreements with 48 hours' notice. 
"My hope is this is a temporary setback," said Robinson. He added, however, 
that the practical effect is "at least for now, we don't have a tool to 
compel them to do what we believe they're obligated to do" -- respond to 
emergency demands for power. 
Reliant has insisted since the suit was filed Feb. 6 that Damrell has no 
jurisdiction over the rate schedules that govern dealings between generators 
and the ISO, and that the Federal Power Act mandates that the FERC must 
settle any disputes about terms of those tariffs. 
In issuing the injunction, Damrell acknowledged that the FERC has special 
expertise concerning agreements between generators and ISO. 
"Absent the extreme exigencies of the California power crisis, the court 
agrees that a stay pending further action by the FERC would be proper," he 
said. "But those are not the facts here. Electricity is in critically short 
supply. The health and safety of the people of California are potentially at 
risk." 
Immediately upon receiving the 9th Circuit's order Thursday, attorneys for 
the ISO asked Damrell to set an accelerated schedule for its motion to amend 
the suit. The agency apparently has crafted a new complaint stressing its 
view that the matter is an ordinary contract dispute over which the judge has 
jurisdiction. 
Damrell scheduled a hearing on the motion for Thursday. 
In a further development that could complicate the state's dire need for 
energy, an alternative supplier won a court fight Thursday to bypass the big 
utilities and sell its power on the open market. 
Timber giant Sierra Pacific Industries, which operates four biomass plants 
that produce power for PG&E, obtained a temporary restraining order in 
Sacramento Superior Court that says Sierra Pacific is not required to sell 
its power to PG&E. 
The ruling means PG&E and Southern Edison could lose power as alternative 
energy generators, fed up with months of nonpayment, sue to be able to sell 
their comparatively cheap product elsewhere, including outside the state.

Dan Walters: Hertzberg's oversight is looking more like a whitewash


(Published April 9, 2001) 
When Bob Hertzberg was elevated into the Assembly speakership a year ago, he 
pledged to make a priority of what's called "oversight" -- the much-neglected 
legislative duty to examine how administrative agencies operate programs. 
"We pass all these bills," Hertzberg said in a speech shortly after being 
elected speaker. "What do they mean? What did they do? We intend to do a 
great deal of oversight." 
Seemingly, Hertzberg made good on his pledge when the Assembly conducted an 
exemplary, bipartisan investigation of state Insurance Commissioner Chuck 
Quackenbush's questionable regulation of insurers. The Assembly investigation 
was the key factor in Quackenbush's decision to abandon his once-promising 
political career. 
Flaying Republican Quackenbush for his shortcomings was relatively easy for 
Democrat Hertzberg. Would he, many wondered, be equally eager to examine 
wrongdoing, or simple incompetence, by Democratic officeholders, especially 
Gov. Gray Davis? 
The answer, apparently, is no. While there are many potential targets for 
deeply probing legislative examinations, Hertzberg and his much-vaunted staff 
of investigators have not given them the same attention as Quackenbush 
received. 
Early this year, the Hertzberg hit team went to work on the energy crisis, 
and Assemblyman Darrell Steinberg, D-Sacramento, was appointed to chair a 
special committee that was to delve into how the crisis came to pass. But 
after fiddling around with the matter for several weeks and failing to 
pinpoint some easy villains, the investigation sputtered. 
The moratorium on oversight occurred just as the committee was moving into an 
area that could have been embarrassing to Davis and state Public Utilities 
Commission President Loretta Lynch -- what they did or did not do last summer 
when the crisis first became apparent. It's an area of inquiry whose 
importance was magnified by Friday's bankruptcy filing by Pacific Gas and 
Electric Co. Republicans complained about the investigation's shutdown, but 
to no avail. 
The hollowness of Hertzberg's oversight pledge was demonstrated again the 
other day when a subcommittee of the Assembly Governmental Organization 
Committee staged what it described as an "informational hearing" on what are 
arguably the state's two most dysfunctional agencies, the Department of 
Veterans Affairs and the California National Guard. 
The former is a mess from top to bottom and has been for years. Its two major 
functions, providing home loans to veterans and operating two residential 
facilities for aged and/or ill veterans, have been plagued by mismanagement 
and downright neglect. It's been a notorious dumping ground for political 
hacks through several gubernatorial administrations. Agency secretaries have 
come and gone in clouds of personal scandal. 
Revelations about the National Guard are more recent but equally disturbing. 
Its readiness for either active military duty or responding to state 
disasters has declined, and its non-military programs supposedly serving 
delinquent youths are marginally effective at best and riddled with financial 
irregularities. Under Adj. Gen. Paul Monroe, the Guard has become top-heavy 
with cronies while Monroe has feuded openly with his second-in-command, Ezell 
Ware. At one point this year, Monroe unilaterally dumped Ware from the slot 
to which he had been appointed by Davis, but within four days Ware was 
restored to his deputy's position. 
The subcommittee's chairman, first-term Assemblyman Ed Chavez, D-La Puente, 
conducted what can only be described as a sham hearing, allowing bureaucrats 
for both agencies to emit a blizzard of self-serving statements and data with 
little or no questioning, and then praising them for their appearances. 
Monroe, he said, "showcased the National Guard as we had hoped." 
If the aborted energy investigation and the Chavez hearing were what 
Hertzberg had in mind as "oversight," a better word might be "whitewash."

PG&E awards bonuses hours before filing Chapter 11 



ASSOCIATED PRESS 
April 8, 2001 
SAN FRANCISCO ) As a reward for "staying the course" the parent company of 
Pacific Gas and Electric Co. awarded about 6,000 bonuses and raises to 
midlevel managers and other employees hours before the utility filed for 
bankruptcy, a newspaper reported. 
PG&E Corp. Chairman Robert Glynn issued an internal memo late Thursday that 
incentive payments denied in January would be awarded to eligible employees 
at the subsidiary utility. 
The payments were made in time for many of the bonuses to be deposited into 
workers' bank accounts before the utility filed for Chapter 11 Friday 
morning, the San Francisco Chronicle reported Saturday after obtaining a copy 
of the memo. 
Gov. Gray Davis issued a brief statement Saturday in response saying "PG&E's 
management is suffering from two afflictions: denial and greed." 
Glynn applauded the employees' "efforts, teamwork and dedication during the 
past year, and particularly throughout the ongoing energy crisis," he wrote. 
"Thank you for staying the course." 
The bonuses and raises were earned as part of the company's incentive 
program. In January, the amount owed to employees who met their department 
objectives was estimated at $83 million, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. spokesman 
Ron Low said Saturday. 
The amount paid out was less than the earlier estimate because top-level 
company executives were exempt from payment. Low did not have a dollar figure 
for the amount paid out but said it was based only on department objectives 
met by employees. 
Low said the money came from a combination of a $1.1 billion tax refund, 
paying power generators only what the company receives in rates and cash 
conservation within the company such as halting the installation of 
underground distribution lines. 
The raises and bonuses were given to secretarial staff, midlevel managers and 
other support staff. No money was distributed to rank-and-file union members 
who already received a wage increase earlier this year as part of their 
contract, Low said. 
The performance-based bonuses can equal up to four weeks of an employee's 
regular salary, said company spokesman John Nelson. 
Annual raises average 3 percent of an employee's salary and are meant to 
balance cost-of-living expenses, he said. 
Los Angeles lawyer David Huard of Manatt, Phelps & Phillips said the practice 
of compensating employees prior to filing Chapter 11 is not uncommon. In 
addition, the U.S. bankruptcy court in San Francisco granted approval for 
Pacific Gas & Electric Co. to make outstanding compensation payments to 
employees and to maintain related bank accounts. 
"It's not unusual for corporations anticipating bankruptcy to sweeten the pot 
and encourage management to stay," Huard said. 
But Assembly Republican Leader Dave Cox, R-Fair Oaks, said it's disgraceful 
to the state's ratepayers. 
"On the surface it's outrageous," he said. "Declaring bankruptcy and at the 
same time providing increases and bonuses for employees would just be in your 
face to the consumers of the state of California."

PG&E looks to court for debt relief; Davis promises to expedite deal with 
Edison 



By Ed Mendel 
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER 
April 7, 2001 
SACRAMENTO -- California's electricity crisis entered a new phase of open 
combat yesterday when the state's largest utility, Pacific Gas and Electric, 
suddenly declared bankruptcy, blaming Gov. Gray Davis for delaying 
negotiations. 
Davis said San Francisco-based PG&E has "dishonored itself" and that he vows 
to complete an agreement with Southern California Edison soon to show that 
negotiation, not bankruptcy, is the best way out of the crisis. 
PG&E said routine service will continue and that no employees will be laid 
off. The bankruptcy filing halts attempts to collect debts from the utility 
as a judge begins a process that some think could be lengthy, with an 
uncertain outcome.

? 



The utility filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy 
law, which means it plans to reorganize and pay off its debt over time. The 
bankruptcy judge, Dennis Montali of San Francisco, may seek a change in a big 
rate increase approved by the Public Utilities Commission last week for PG&E 
customers. 
Creditors form committees under the bankruptcy process to represent their 
interests. Angry consumer groups said they will form a committee of their own 
and attempt to become part of the process. 
The consumer groups accused PG&E of maneuvering to protect its parent firm, 
PG&E Corp., while forcing ratepayers to pay off an $8.9 billion debt, run up 
while rates were frozen under deregulation and wholesale power costs soared. 
"The holding company vacuumed all of the assets out of the utility and is 
perfectly willing to let it go bankrupt," said Nettie Hoge of The Utility 
Reform Network in San Francisco. 
Senate Energy Committee Chairwoman Debra Bowen, D-Marina del Rey, a lawyer 
who worked on the Chrysler bankruptcy, predicted one benefit of the 
bankruptcy will be that generators accused of gouging California will not get 
full payment. 
"There is no way generators expecting to get paid 100 cents on the dollar 
come out of a bankruptcy with 100 cents on the dollar," Bowen said. 
The surprise PG&E announcement came the morning after the governor used a 
statewide televised address to reassure the public that he had a plan for 
ending the crisis, which included paying off the utilities' huge debt. 
But PG&E, which has resisted state purchase of its transmission system in 
exchange for payment of its debt, said it concluded that the court offers the 
best way out while the utility continues routine service to customers. 
"The regulatory and political processes have not provided a solution, and now 
we are turning to the court," said Robert Glynn Jr., chairman of PG&E Corp. 
Glynn said Davis aides did not meet with PG&E for more than three weeks while 
they tried to wrap up the Edison deal and that they then did little in a 
meeting this week. 
"We have heard a lot of words from the Sacramento sources that simply have 
not come to fruition," Glynn said. 
The governor, who used the televised address to drop his opposition to a big 
rate increase and propose one of his own, was not happy to learn that he has 
lost his battle to keep the utilities out of bankruptcy. 
"I believe PG&E has dishonored itself," Davis said as he signed a bill in 
downtown San Diego yesterday. "It has created undue alarm among 34 million 
citizens of this state." 
Davis acknowledged that the PG&E bankruptcy may force him to alter his rescue 
plan based on the principle that the utilities must give the state something 
in exchange for aid in paying off their debts. 
To make the deal work, he said, he needs the transmission systems of all 
three utilities: PG&E, Edison, and San Diego Gas and Electric. 
The judge and the creditor committees presumably would have to approve the 
sale of the PG&E transmission system. If that is not possible, Davis said, he 
will negotiate for "comparable assets," such as the hydroelectric facilities 
owned by the utilities. 
The governor's plan would give the utilities part of the revenue from the 
monthly bills paid by their customers -- a "dedicated rate component" -- that 
could be used to finance an $8 billion bond to pay off their debts. 
In San Diego, the governor signed a bill that extends the SDG&E rate cap to 
businesses, retroactive to Feb. 7. He appeared earlier at an Escondido 
elementary school, where he praised student conservation efforts. 
Davis told reporters that PG&E chairman Glynn told him a week ago that the 
PG&E board was one vote short of filing for bankruptcy and that seeking a 
solution in the court was "a very real option." 
The governor said PG&E chose to further its own interests, not the best 
interest of Californians. In contrast, he said, PG&E's creditors have acted 
responsibly and shown faith in negotiations by not pushing the utility into 
bankruptcy. 
"I am pleased that Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric 
are allowing us to negotiate a settlement as opposed to forcing this matter 
into bankruptcy," he said. 
Davis said he planned to attend a previously scheduled meeting yesterday 
afternoon with John Bryson, Edison's top executive, to work on the final 
issues in the purchase of its transmission system. 
"We are down to a few remaining issues that we hope to work out within the 
next very few days," Davis said. 
Southern California's parent, Edison International, yesterday emphasized the 
importance of completing the sale of the transmission system quickly to 
prevent creditors from taking the utility into bankruptcy. 
Lynn LoPucki, a UCLA law professor who specializes in corporate bankruptcies, 
predicted that Edison will follow PG&E into bankruptcy. He said the two 
utilities have comparable business plans and have made similar decisions so 
far. 
"They have pretty much marched together on this," LoPucki said. 
PG&E and Edison say they ran up a combined debt of $13 billion when their 
rates were frozen under deregulation last year and wholesale power costs 
soared. 
After generators refused to extend the utilities more credit, the state was 
forced to begin buying power for utility customers in mid-January. The state 
has spent more than $4 billion so far, most of it on the expensive spot 
market. 
The state has signed more than $40 billion worth of long-term contracts to 
provide cheaper power during the next 10 years. The state general fund will 
be repaid by a bond of $12 billion or more, paid off by ratepayers over a 
dozen years. 
Glynn said PG&E decided to declare bankruptcy because the PUC, while raising 
the utility's rates last week, gave the additional money to the state for its 
power purchases and imposed new costs on PG&E by requiring the utility to pay 
small nonutility generators. 
In addition, said Glynn, the PUC adopted an "illegal and retroactive 
accounting change" advocated by consumer groups that would have counted 
transfers to the parent firm to offset the estimate of the utility's debt. 
But another important factor was that the state has not been paying for 
expensive last-minute power acquisitions made by the Independent System 
Operator to keep the grid at minimum levels. 
Glynn said the state has been improperly assigning the cost of this expensive 
emergency power to PG&E, increasing the utility's debt at an estimated rate 
of $300 million a month. 
Ironically, federal regulators ruled yesterday that generators cannot be 
forced to sell emergency power to the California grid if the utilities can't 
pay for it. Now the state may have to begin paying for the emergency power. 
PG&E contends that if the PUC had approved its request for a rate increase 
last fall, the utility would have raised rates less than the PUC and Davis 
have proposed, obtained cheap long-term power contracts, and thus the state 
would not have had to begin buying power. 
Under bankruptcy, PG&E said it will be able to pay all new bills, continue 
normal service to its customers, and provide health care and other benefits 
to its employees and retirees. But payments on bonds and loans may be 
suspended, the utility said. 
Glynn said he expected bankruptcy to aid shareholders by halting PG&E's 
mounting debt. But the surprising move caused the stock of all three 
California utilities to drop yesterday, and trading in PG&E stock was halted 
briefly. 
Some small nonutility generators that operate under the federal "qualifying 
facilities" program have formed a creditors committee, the first step toward 
taking Edison into bankruptcy. 
A spokesman for the creditors committee, Jack Raudy, said yesterday that 
PG&E's bankruptcy "underscores the state's critical need for a real solution 
without further delay." 
The generators who formed the creditors committee get power from "renewable" 
sources such as wind, solar, geothermal and biomass. Nonutility 
"co-generators" use natural-gas turbines and sell the waste heat to 
businesses. 
"None of the members that I represent are interested in putting Edison into 
involuntary bankruptcy," said Ann MacLeod of the California Cogeneration 
Council.

Utility argues for Otay power plant 



Rivals claim it would add to area pollution
By Jeff McDonald 
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER 
April 7, 2001 
While attorneys for the state's largest utility were filing for bankruptcy 
protection in San Francisco yesterday, executives from its sister company 
were in San Diego lobbying state energy officials to push ahead with a huge 
investment. 
At a committee hearing in the County Administration Building yesterday, PG&E 
National Energy Group urged a California Energy Commission committee to 
approve plans for a 510-megawatt power plant on Otay Mesa. Operators of two 
power plants in the county opposed the request, saying it could result in 
dirtier skies. 
"We're focused on getting this plant on-line as soon as possible," project 
manager Sharon Segner told the panel. "Any (commission) delay, whether it's a 
week or a month, presents greater risk of this plant not coming online in 
2003 .?.?. The schedule is already tight." 
The bankruptcy filing by Pacific Gas and Electric has no effect on the Otay 
Mesa project, Segner said. "It may be confusing to the public, but at the end 
of the day, we are separate companies," she said after the hearing. 
The Otay Mesa application, which has been in the works for more than three 
years, is expected to be considered by the full commission April 18. The 
plant would provide enough power for roughly 380,000 homes and businesses. 
The siting committee has indicated its support for the project, but the 
hearing yesterday was intended to give opponents and members of the public an 
opportunity to testify for and against the plant. 
Attorneys for the owners of the Encina and South Bay power plants urged the 
committee to reject the Otay Mesa project, saying the area's natural-gas 
pipelines could not accommodate enough fuel to supply another plant. 
What's more, lawyers for Duke Energy and Cabrillo Power said, the Otay Mesa 
plant could only run on natural gas. The two existing plants can run on 
natural gas or fuel oil, which causes more pollution. If there are natural 
gas shortages, the lawyers said their clients would have to burn the dirtier 
fuel. 
"We would be criticized for that publicly," said Jane Luckhardt, an attorney 
for Duke Energy, which operates the South Bay plant in Chula Vista. "We will 
be forced to purchase very expensive (smog) emission credits." 
A consultant for Cabrillo Power, which co-owns the Encina plant in Carlsbad, 
also told the committee that the Otay Mesa facility would hurt his clients. 
Robert Weatherwax of Sierra Energy and Risk Assessment told the panel that 
allowing the Otay Mesa plant would create as much as 800 tons of smog, 
although he did not specify over how long a period the extra smog would be 
created. 
The new power plant "will force Encina and South Bay to burn more oil," 
Weatherwax warned. 
The PG&E National Energy Group said it will get much of its fuel from a 
natural gas pipeline scheduled to be built between Blythe and Tijuana. Gas 
from that line would power both the Otay Mesa plant and another in Rosarito, 
Mexico, company officials said. 
"There's no nexus between our proceeding and their issues," Segner said of 
the complaints from Duke Energy and Cabrillo Power attorneys. 
The Otay Mesa power plant application won praise from several business groups 
as well as Supervisor Bill Horn, who urged the committee to approve the 
project as soon as possible. 
Horn said he received numerous complaints from area biotechnology firms after 
rolling blackouts hit San Diego County for the first time last month. Three 
companies in particular reported losing years of research, he said. 
The Otay Mesa project "will play a key role in solving the energy problem 
that's plaguing San Diego County," Horn told the committee. While the plant 
would brighten the West's electricity supply picture, there is no requirement 
that the power generated at the Otay Mesa plant be used in San Diego County. 
The project was opposed by some environmentalists, who chastised the 
California Energy Commission for relying too heavily on fossil fuels for the 
state's power needs. 
William Claycomb of the Save Our Bay nonprofit group said commissioners 
should focus more attention on lowering the price of photovoltaic systems, 
which use solar power to provide energy to homes and businesses. 
"We're going to spend a lot of time and money building power plants up to our 
ears that won't be needed" in the coming years, Claycomb said. "The sun is 
the ultimate source of energy." 
Ownership of the Otay Mesa plant will be transferred to Calpine Corp. of San 
Jose once final approval is granted by the state Energy Commission.

United at the start, lawmakers now split on how to clean mess 



By Toby Eckert?
COPLEY NEWS SERVICE 
April 7, 2001 
WASHINGTON -- Back in 1997, as California's experiment with electricity 
deregulation was about to get under way, the state's entire House delegation 
signed a letter assuring congressional leaders that the plan would "provide 
tremendous benefits to the citizens of our state." 
Now that the experiment is acknowledged as an abject failure, the delegation 
has yet to present a united front on what, if anything, the federal 
government should do to help out. 
Most notably, there seems to be no consensus on the wisdom of slapping 
federal price controls on the stratospheric cost of wholesale power in the 
West. While nearly all California Democrats have publicly embraced the 
proposal, including U.S. Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, only a 
handful of Republicans have joined them. 
"In terms of price caps, there are deep divisions," an aide to one top 
California Republican said. 
Many GOP members worry that price controls "would leave (power companies) 
disinterested in selling to the California market," aggravating the 
electricity shortage, the aide said. 
The feeling is not unanimous among Republicans, however. Republican Reps. 
Duncan Hunter of El Cajon and Randy "Duke" Cunningham of Escondido -- whose 
San Diego-area constituents were hit with huge power bills last summer -- 
have advocated wholesale price limits. 
And some Democrats suspect there are more California Republicans who are 
willing to support price controls but are wary of publicly challenging the 
Bush administration, which adamantly opposes the limits. 
"I think there are Republicans who are very supportive. And we hope that they 
will join us," said Rep. Susan Davis, D-San Diego. 
California consumer advocates, who favor price controls, are critical of the 
congressional response. 
"They all organized themselves when it came time to pushing for the utility 
companies (who favored deregulation). But they're not organized at all when 
it comes to (price) caps. They're AWOL," said Harvey Rosenfield, president of 
the Santa Monica-based Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. 
But Tim Ransdell, executive director of the nonpartisan California Institute 
for Federal Policy Research, said the divisions in the congressional 
delegation reflect the complexity of the power crisis. 
"If there was a silver bullet for this, if there was a single obvious remedy, 
I think Californians would flock to it," Ransdell said. "Price caps may be 
the right way to go or they may not be. There are strong arguments in varying 
directions. They've got to do something. Nobody knows what the right 
something is." 
Congressional delegations from other states affected by the power crisis, 
such as Washington and Oregon, are similarly divided. 
Despite the rift over price controls, the GOP aide maintained that California 
Republicans and Democrats "have worked together in a number of ways to ensure 
that the (Bush) administration is paying attention to the problem and doing 
what it can." 
Members of both parties sent strong signals to the administration that the 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission was not doing enough to address the 
power crisis, the aide said. That message played a role in President Bush's 
reported desire to replace FERC Chairman Curtis Hebert and the commission's 
subsequent flurry of threats to order power providers to pay refunds for 
overcharging California utilities, the aide speculated. 
Other observers say Bush merely wants to install his "own man" as head of 
FERC -- former Texas utility regulator Pat Wood -- and that the agency's 
actions amount to tokenism. 
Some Democrats believe that the pressure for federal electricity price 
controls will grow as consumers throughout California start seeing a recent 
retail rate hike show up in their bills. Widespread blackouts this summer 
could add more momentum. 
"I think we're going to be witnessing initiatives, referenda, recall efforts, 
a consumer revolution in California unless we find a way to put a tourniquet 
on this problem," said Rep. Jane Harman, D-Venice.

GOP activists feel state is being snubbed by Bush 



They fault administration's handling of energy crisis
By George E. Condon Jr. 
COPLEY NEWS SERVICE 
April 7, 2001 
WASHINGTON -- California Republican activists are starting to grow restive at 
what many see as President Bush's inattention to the nation's largest state 
in the opening months of his administration. 
Despite frequent assurances from the White House that the president has 
California concerns on his agenda, many Republicans believe that he has 
already missed an opportunity to rebound from his shellacking in the state in 
November's election. 
"It is a slow, day-by-day erosion of California confidence in the 
administration's understanding of the needs and desires of Californians. 
There are people here who are getting pretty nervous," said a senior 
Republican, who has been heavily involved in Republican administrations in 
Sacramento and Washington. 
"It's just slowly backing up in the California consciousness that these guys 
look like they're completely out of touch with mainstream California 
concerns," said the Republican, a longtime Bush supporter who would speak 
only on the condition that he not be named out of fear of being branded 
"disloyal" by the White House. 
Other Republicans are equally cautious about going public with their 
concerns. But they don't like what they have seen so far: 
?By the end of next week, Bush will have visited 25 states, including 11 of 
the most populous 13, but not California. 
?There is no Californian among the president's senior domestic advisers. The 
highest-ranking Californians on the president's domestic staff are Ruben 
Barrales, director of the office of intergovernmental affairs, and Lezlee 
Westine, director of public liaison. 
?His early environmental and abortion actions have been at odds with majority 
California views. 
?The administration's early positions on the energy crisis have come across 
to many Californians as aloof and uninvolved. 
Gerry Parsky, the Rancho Santa Fe investment banker who ran the Texan's 
California campaign last year, is the president's prime adviser in the state. 
He disagrees with the criticism now bubbling up and urges skeptics to take a 
second look. 
"My message is that from the moment that this president began his campaign 
for the presidency, he made it clear that California was important to him and 
that he was committed to helping change the face of the Republican Party in 
California and to reach out to people that felt left out," said Parsky. 
"That began with the campaign, it carried throughout the campaign. And since 
he's been president, he's demonstrated repeatedly, with appointments he has 
made and with his continual contact with the state, that he hasn't changed 
his position at all," added Parsky. 
Three Californians serve in Bush's Cabinet: Ann Veneman, Norman Mineta and 
Anthony Principi are, respectively, secretaries of agriculture, 
transportation and veterans affairs. 
At the White House, spokesman Ken Lisaius objected to tallies of presidential 
trips that have excluded California. 
"It's a little unfair to say that, because somebody is not there, that they 
don't care or they're ignoring the state," he said, calling administration 
officials "very engaged" in the state's issues. 
But other Republicans say there are few visible signs of that engagement. 
More troubling than the president's travel itinerary, they say, has been the 
administration's handling of the state's energy crisis. With staunch 
opposition to price caps and the appointment of a Dick Cheney-led task force, 
the administration has emphasized that the problem was caused by a bad 
California law and it is up to Californians to extricate themselves from the 
mess. 
Over and over, Democrats -- gleefully -- and Republicans -- ruefully -- say 
the impression left has been a paraphrase of the famous 1970s New York 
tabloid headline: "Bush to California: Drop Dead!" 
"Substantively, the administration has been saying all the right things," 
said veteran state Republican operative Dan Schnur. "But stylistically, the 
message that Californians hear is that George Bush doesn't care." 
Energy, he said, "is the only issue in California right now and the 
administration's distance represents a missed opportunity to make up lost 
ground." 
Garry Sragow, a Democratic consultant in the state, said his daily tracking 
polls since Bush's inauguration show his popularity remaining flat in 
California, evincing none of the honeymoon bounce evident nationally. But he 
said there has been a steady, daily increase in the number of Californians 
who say the president should "do more" about the energy crisis. That number 
now stands, he said, at two-thirds of Californians. 
"He is not feeling our pain the way Bill Clinton did," said Sherry Bebitch 
Jeffe, a political scientist at the University of Southern California. "There 
is a disconnect between George Bush and California." 
Democratic pollster Mark Mellman said the message is clear: 
"He doesn't care enough about the state to even show up. And on the issue 
most critically important to the state, he refuses to do anything. There 
couldn't be a bigger kiss-off." 
There have been no recent public polls. Surveys of California voters taken 
for the administration show Bush's popularity lagging below his national 
numbers. 
"He's got no place to go but up," said Sragow. "He started off with his 
hard-core base in California. He's not going to lose them. The question is, 
will he begin to attract swing voters? And he has made no effort to do that 
yet." 
It is with these voters that the environmental decisions have been damaging, 
said several analysts, who also noted the sharp contrast between the current 
approach to the state and that adopted by Clinton. 
"We got accused of throwing too much to California and ignoring the rest of 
the country. He's getting accused of the opposite," said John Emerson, the 
California lawyer who was a senior adviser to Clinton. 
Unless it is changed, he warned, Bush's hands-off approach to the state 
"almost fore-ordains a blowout" loss in 2004.

With Power Price Surges, California's a Follower 

Energy: Much of the nation is already being zapped by double-digit increases. 
Several states have higher rates. Deregulation, anti-pollution laws and 
distance from fuel sources are to blame. 

By ERIC SLATER, Times Staff Writer 

?????CHICAGO--For all its energy notoriety and outrage over surging 
electricity rates, California has plenty of company. Much of the nation faces 
double-digit price hikes, and several states--especially in the 
East--continue to pay more for electricity than California.
?????Not even Gov. Gray Davis' reluctant proposal last week to kick rates up 
as much as 34.5% for the heaviest residential users would guarantee 
California the dubious honor of having the priciest electricity in the United 
States.
?????Overshadowed by the rhetoric, lawsuits and rolling blackouts is the fact 
that Californians have been paying less for electricity than residents in 
Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Vermont, New York, Alaska and, by a longshot, 
Hawaii. California, in fact, is barely in the top 10 when it comes to 
electrical prices.
?????One of the reasons that Californians have been paying less is because 
they conserve more, with the average resident draining 40% less from the grid 
than the average American.
?????Another reason, however, is that California's rates have been frozen by 
law, even as the lids have been coming off the prices in other states that 
are deregulating their utilities.
?????"I don't know about you guys," said state Sen. Sheila Kuehl (D-Santa 
Monica) at a hearing last week in Sacramento, "but my constituents don't 
think they suffered over the past several years because their rates didn't go 
up 45% and 50% the way they did in New York and Pennsylvania and other parts 
of this country."
?????These dramatic price spikes are driven by a strange, worst-case 
confluence of electrical-world forces.
?????A drought in the Northwest means that there's not enough water to turn 
the turbines in the great hydroelectric dams; massive price increases for 
natural gas come even as the country is moving toward more natural 
gas-powered electrical generators; and the deregulation of utilities--left 
largely up to individual states--has proved more complicated than almost 
anyone dreamed.
?????"We look at it as a perfect storm," Rep. Jay Inslee (D-Wash.) said of 
the improbably bad stew of circumstances.
?????In Boston, residential users face a possible 23% hike, industrial 
customers 69%. In Cheyenne, Wyo., some residential customers are insulating 
themselves against possible hikes of 57%, with some commercial customers 
looking at an 88% jump. In Idaho, they're talking hikes of between 34% and 
63% for some customers. In Nevada, rate hikes scheduled at more than 1% a 
month, starting in September and continuing until September 2003, will raise 
residential rates about 75%.
?????All this after two decades of steadily declining electricity rates in 
the U.S.--with almost all of the price drops preceding the deregulation that 
was supposed to bring down prices.

?????Price of Power Fell Steadily for Years
?????In the early 1980s, one kilowatt hour of power cost residential 
customers about a dime. Over the next two decades, Americans began to employ 
more energy-efficient appliances, computers, even lightbulbs, and utilities 
produced their power more and more efficiently.
?????At the same time, utilities took advantage of low interest rates to help 
retire massive debt incurred during the high-cost, post-Chernobyl building of 
nuclear reactors, and they were thus able to pass on further savings to 
customers.
?????By last year, buying a kilowatt hour set the average American back just 
7.5 cents.
?????The trend has suddenly stopped.
?????In a forecast released Friday, the Energy Information Administration 
predicts that a kilowatt hour will cost about 8 cents on average nationally 
by the end of this year and rise another half-cent in 2002.
?????"For the first time in a long time, the prices are going up," said 
administration forecaster Neil Gamson.
?????A one-cent increase in the price per kilowatt hour would boost the 
monthly bill of a typical California residential customer by about $10, to 
$117. For big industrial users, the extra monthly cost could be in the 
thousands.
?????Substantial regional differences have always existed, with the Northeast 
the longtime home of the highest prices in the continental U.S. Some 
Northeastern customers pay twice as much, or more, than consumers 3,000 miles 
due west.
?????One reason is that, although environmental laws in the Northeast are 
typically less stringent than those in California and the Northwest, growing 
concerns and tougher anti-pollution legislation have forced utilities to 
shift away from the higher-polluting coal-powered generators and toward 
cleaner-burning natural gas. The environmentally conscious move has left 
them, like several other areas, vulnerable to the recent price spikes of 
natural gas.
?????The Northeast is also farther from most major sources of fuel, including 
natural gas, oil and coal.
?????Several states in the Northeast, including Connecticut, Maine, New 
Hampshire, New York and Massachusetts, are actively deregulating. Like 
California, only with less drama, they are finding the birth of a free market 
painful and expensive.
?????Under Massachusetts' deregulation statute, the standard retail rate for 
a kilowatt hour was fixed at an average of just over 9 cents through 2005. 
However, the rise in natural gas prices has left utilities pleading with 
regulators to allow them to raise prices, lest they face California's problem 
of selling their power at a loss--precisely the circumstance that led the 
Pacific Gas & Electric Co. of San Francisco to declare bankruptcy Friday.

?????Kilowatt Hour's Average Cost Rising
?????Earlier this month, the Massachusetts Electric Co. got the go-ahead to 
charge 270,000 residential customers an additional 23%. Statewide, analysts 
say, the average price of a kilowatt hour is probably edging up from its 
already high October figure, the last available, of 11.2 cents.
?????In New York, the average cost of a kilowatt hour statewide was 14.1 
cents in October. However, even under a deregulation plan that won't fully 
free the utilities from price controls until 2002, some New York City 
residents have seen their rates rise by nearly 20%, to 13.9 cents a kilowatt 
hour, in recent months.
?????Still, Cornell University economist Tim Mount said he would be surprised 
and "very disappointed if we mess things up in the East as badly as they 
messed it up in California. I think the regulators thought that it would be 
easy to run a market, and they didn't allow for very much malfeasance" on the 
part of newly untethered utilities or private power generators.
?????The South, with its coal reserves, has long hovered in the relatively 
cheap range of 6 to 8 cents per kilowatt hour and, along with the Midwest, is 
likely to be among the most stable areas in the near future.
?????Several states in the South and Midwest are also among the last to 
consider deregulation--for the very reason that their power is already 
cheap--and so may benefit the most from studying the daily jolt of news out 
of California.
?????The Midwest has, as with so many things, been a picture of moderation 
when it comes to electrical rates. A kilowatt hour goes for 7 to 8 cents or, 
in the case of Illinois, a bit over 9 cents. (Chicago, the country's 
third-largest city and the location of several infamous--although 
localized--blackouts in 1999, tends to raise the state's average 
considerably.)
?????Having continued to build power plants when states in the West and East 
had all but halted construction, and with Illinois home to 11 
price-stabilizing nuclear reactors, the Midwest is expected to hold the line, 
at least in the near future.
?????The Northwest, long the land of cheap, clean hydroelectric power, is 
already beginning to see its 5- and 6-cent electric rates climb.
?????Many of the utilities in the Northwest receive huge portions of their 
juice from the Bonneville Power Administration, which oversees 29 dams in the 
Columbia and Snake River basins and provides 45% of the region's electricity.
?????However, the severity of the region's drought--and the accompanying 
electricity shortage--was illustrated last week when the BPA announced that 
it would stop spilling precious water over its dams to help the spring salmon 
run.
?????Announcing the news to residents who for decades have fought to restore 
salmon runs decimated by the dams was perhaps made a bit easier for acting 
BPA administrator Steve Wright because he had previously made another 
announcement. The BPA, Wright said, would likely be raising its own wholesale 
rates from 95% to 200% come October.
?????Some of the rate hikes around the country are surcharges, meant to fill 
utility coffers left empty by the leap in natural gas prices, for example. 
Many others, however, are viewed as permanent. In the West, especially, there 
is simply no reason to believe that costs will drop any time soon.
?????The bankruptcy move Friday by PG&E only solidified that widely held 
opinion. Among its other worries, Bonneville has been holding a $100-million 
IOU from California utilities--half of it owed by PG&E--and hoping that money 
would help to mitigate its rate hikes to other customers.
?????When PG&E became the biggest utility in U.S. history to seek bankruptcy 
protection, BPA became just another creditor likely to lose money.

Judge in PG&E Bankruptcy Case Seen as a Problem Solver 

Courts: Dennis Montali will face unprecedented legal complexities. 

By MAURA DOLAN, Times Legal Affairs Writer 




*

Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali is called a "reasonable man."
AP

?????SAN FRANCISCO--U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali, who will oversee 
Pacific Gas & Electric Co.'s bankruptcy reorganization, is a highly respected 
scholar and effective mediator known for persuading reluctant parties to 
reach agreement.
?????In a recent case, Montali achieved in only three days a settlement 
between a debtor and creditors in the bankruptcy of an international 
engineering firm. The case had been in bruising litigation for two years when 
another judge asked Montali to mediate it.
?????As a lawyer, Montali helped divert a statewide agricultural crisis 10 
years ago by persuading warring factions to accept a deal in the bankruptcy 
of an agricultural cooperative, according to a lawyer in the case.
?????"He is very good at not embarrassing people but getting them to 
understand they are wrong," said lawyer Larry Engel, who has known and worked 
with Montali for two decades.
?????Montali, 60, the son of a winemaker, grew up in San Francisco and now 
lives in Berkeley. He is considered among the top tier of bankruptcy experts 
in the United States. 
?????He will be calling the shots in one of the largest bankruptcy 
reorganizations in U.S. history. The case raises unprecedented legal 
questions and is expected to make new law. Some of the legal disputes may 
wind up before the U.S. Supreme Court, attorneys said.
?????Lawyers who know the easygoing, witty judge say he is probably relishing 
this legal challenge the way a golfer looks forward to playing a new and more 
difficult course. The court action begins today, when Montali is expected to 
decide whether PG&E can spend cash that others have laid claims to. 
?????Right from the beginning, Montali will be in the limelight, and lawyers 
will be eagerly searching for any clues to his leanings. Montali declined to 
be interviewed, but those who know him say he is fair, smart, hard-working 
and thoughtful. He does not browbeat, but quietly negotiates to bring people 
around, lawyers said.
?????The judge is highly engaged in his cases. He is well prepared, 
intellectually curious and knows the hard questions to ask, lawyers said. He 
also is a relatively quick decision-maker, frequently ruling from the bench.
?????"Reality tends to come out" in his courtroom because Montali does not 
allow lawyers to evade his questions, Engel said.
?????There are few precedents to guide Montali in many of the novel legal 
questions he is likely to be asked to rule upon. Can he order electricity 
rate hikes? The law is unclear. Can he force energy suppliers to hold down 
their prices? Doubtful, bankruptcy lawyers said. Can he force PG&E's parent 
company to cough up some money? Possibly. Can he force PG&E to sell off 
assets? Yes, but probably not in the near term.
?????"This is going to be one of these cases where the envelope is going to 
be pushed, and I think there is a danger in making any categorical statements 
right now," said a bankruptcy lawyer who is involved in the case.
?????PG&E's Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization will be enormously complex 
legally, lawyers said. Montali will have to reconcile state utility law and 
federal energy law with bankruptcy law. Bankruptcy judges have broad 
discretion to decide disputes, and Montali will control PG&E's purse strings.
?????Lawyers who know Montali well say he is savvy about using the Internet 
to communicate court information, masters arcane legal subjects quickly, and 
probably is thrilled to be making the calls in a case that will be watched 
nationally.
?????Some people go on the bench to retire. Montali went on in 1993 to have 
more fun intellectually, lawyers said.
?????Montali "tends to be very constructive," said another lawyer who asked 
not to be identified by name because he may represent a creditor in the PG&E 
case. "He wants his cases to go somewhere, and he tries to encourage people 
to make progress."
?????Before he was appointed to the bench, Montali had practiced bankruptcy 
law for more than two decades. He began representing debtors but was doing 
primarily creditor work in his last law firm job with the city's venerable 
Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro.
?????The bankruptcy bar he was a part of is relatively small, and the lawyers 
who practice it know one another. Several lawyers interviewed about Montali 
referred to him by his first name.
?????Because these lawyers are likely to be players together in many cases 
over the years, trustworthiness is important, bankruptcy attorneys said. 
Effectiveness requires that other members of the bar trust your word and 
credibility.
?????The practice also requires knowledge of economics and economic terms, 
ease both with deal making and trial work, and above all else, practicality, 
lawyers said.
?????Whereas a business litigator may know exactly what he or she will be 
doing two months from now, bankruptcy lawyers tend to operate on tight 
deadlines with little notice. Many of these lawyers were at their desks over 
the weekend preparing for the PG&E case.
?????"There is no one in town who is not part of this case," said Engel, who 
is representing a municipal utility. "Everyone is involved."
?????Montali is tall, lanky and balding. His trademark is his handlebar 
mustache, which he has worn for decades and which reflects his gregariousness 
and humor, other lawyers said. He cooks Italian food expertly and likes to 
sail around San Francisco Bay and walk his dog during his time away from 
work. His wife, Mary, is in the real estate business, and they have three 
grown daughters.
?????As a lawyer, Montali was masterful at bringing about a compromise in the 
bankruptcy of a major agricultural cooperative a decade ago, Engels said. At 
the time the co-op went bankrupt, farmers had picked their crops, but there 
was no money to operate the canneries and no money to pay the growers. 
Montali was representing a bank in the case.
?????"We could have had a disaster," Engel said. "Literally, imagine if 5,000 
farmers lost their entire crop because there was nobody to take it. Each of 
them would have gone into bankruptcy."
?????The parties locked themselves together in one place for a week and half. 
Montali was "at the core of it," Engel said. He persuaded all parties to 
agree to a plan that involved selling the cooperative. "He would take someone 
who was being a problem over to the side and explain that it wasn't going to 
work if they persisted that way," Engel said.
?????"He is the ultimate reasonable man who convinced them that this path is 
the one they needed to be on in their own self-interest."
?????Richard Levin, a Los Angeles bankruptcy lawyer, said Montali has 
"tremendous integrity." As a lawyer, he was cogent and forceful in arguments 
and would make simple, clear statements that would cause everyone in the 
courtroom to pause and think, Levin said.?????Montali earned a bachelor's 
degree in English from Notre Dame University and then entered the Navy to 
fulfill a Reserve Officer's Training Corps commitment.
?????He served in various officer positions on two destroyers and taught 
briefly at the United States Navy Reserve Officers Candidate School in 
Newport, R.I., before entering law school. He obtained his law degree from UC 
Berkeley's Boalt Hall School of Law in 1968.
?????Montali has been elected to the National Bankruptcy Conference and the 
American College of Bankruptcy, both elite bodies reserved for those at the 
top of their field.
?????Last year, he was appointed to hear appeals in bankruptcy cases for the 
U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in addition to his trial duties.
?????One of his first cases on the bench ended in disaster. Shortly after he 
became a judge, he ruled in favor of a landlord who was trying to evict a 
tenant. The tenant had a bankruptcy case before Montali.
?????The tenant later went to the landlord's office, shot and killed him, 
wounded the landlord's son and tried to kill himself.
?????"I didn't have any regret about the decision," Montali told the Daily 
Journal, a legal newspaper, several years ago. "But it reinforced in the real 
world that I'm making decisions that affect people. It put some real meaning 
into things."
?????In 1997, Montali ruled that a gay man was liable for damages because he 
failed to warn his former lover that he was infected with HIV before they had 
unprotected sex.
?????The case had wound up before Montali because the defendant filed for 
bankruptcy to avoid paying monetary damages if he lost the sexual battery 
lawsuit.

Bankruptcy Filing Threatens Tax Bases 

PG&E: Counties, particularly small ones like Plumas, depend on revenue for 
schools and other services. 

By RONE TEMPEST, Times Sacramento Bureau Chief 

?????QUINCY, Calif.--The PG&E bankruptcy protection filing Friday came only 
four days before the state's largest utility is to make $80 million in 
property tax payments to 49 California counties.
?????In Northern California's remote Plumas County, this was especially bad 
news. Because of its large hydroelectric holdings, Pacific Gas & Electric is 
Plumas' largest taxpayer, accounting for about 18% of the county's 
$2.3-billion tax base.
?????Bankruptcy laws usually require that government obligations, including 
taxes, be paid first. But the uncertainty over financially crippled PG&E's 
ability to pay sent tremors through government offices in the High Sierra 
county south of Mt. Lassen.
?????"If we took a hit like that, we were probably looking at job layoffs and 
program curtailments," said County Assessor Chuck Leonhardt. He said things 
ranging from library books to police salaries could be affected.
?????The state's two biggest private utilities, PG&E and Southern California 
Edison, annually pay more than a quarter-billion dollars in property taxes, 
including $70 million levied on Edison by Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and 
San Bernardino counties. Edison officials said their company intends to meet 
the Tuesday property tax deadline.
?????The biggest impact of unpaid taxes falls on the state, which is legally 
required to supply most uncollected money that is for schools--which is most 
of the property tax load. In smaller, rural counties like Plumas, which has a 
permanent population of only 22,000, a utility tax default would seriously 
reduce funding for other local services. PG&E pays Plumas almost $4 million a 
year in taxes.
?????A large county that could be seriously hurt by a PG&E default is San 
Luis Obispo on the central coast, where the utility's Diablo Canyon nuclear 
plant generates $28 million in property taxes, about 15% of the county's tax 
revenue.
?????"This is not catastrophic for us, but it is significant," said county 
Auditor-Controller Gere Sibbach. Sibbach said one large school district, San 
Luis Coastal, could come up $2 million short as a result of a PG&E default.
?????"That school district gets $10 million in taxes from PG&E," Sibbach 
said, "but the state will only backfill for $8 million, so they would have to 
cut programs if PG&E doesn't pay."
?????Plumas County faces a double threat in the PG&E bankruptcy filing.
?????Here, beautiful Lake Almanor and other hydroelectric reservoirs are 
strung along the north fork of the cascading Feather River. The "PG&E lakes," 
as the reservoirs are known here, are what attract retirees and 
tourists--mainstays of the fragile local economy since the timber industry 
went into decline.
?????The landscape here is rich in broad, green valleys and more than 100 
lakes. In addition to boating and fishing, the county has 10 golf 
courses--one for each 2,200 residents.
?????Because hydroelectricity is at such a premium this year, the utility is 
expected to suck all the water it can from Lake Almanor and nearby Bucks 
Lake, bringing potential ruin to the area's tourism and recreation industry.
?????"They are probably going to draw every drop of water out of the lake 
they can," said Marvin Alexander, one of the retirees who lives on Lake 
Almanor. "The boat ramps won't even reach the water."
?????The equation here is simple: When lake levels fall too low, the fish 
don't bite, the tourists don't come and the property values decline. 
According to real estate agent Tim O'Brien, Lake Almanor homes have sold in 
recent years for $500,000 to $1 million.
?????These days the housing market is slow. "This community basically lives 
and dies by the lake levels," explained Chris Luna, a Chester civil engineer 
and home builder.
?????The energy crisis is disrupting what had become a comfortable 
relationship in recent years. For most of the last decade, Plumas County 
homeowners and businesses have evolved a modus vivendi with PG&E.
?????With electricity in good supply, PG&E officials kept the lake high in 
July to keep boaters and fishermen happy. Residents agreed not to make too 
much fuss when the lake level declined in late August so the utilities could 
generate power.
?????But now that the specter of rotating blackouts is haunting the populous 
and politically powerful California lowlands this summer, few here hold out 
much hope that PG&E will continue to be the benign water lord they have come 
to know.
?????"I have a feeling," said Alexander, a former college administrator who 
is on a local committee that deals with water rights, "that this year the 
need for public power is going to take priority over the need for recreation."
?????PG&E spokeswoman Lisa Randle would not say how much water the utility is 
drawing from the upper lakes. But Plumas County residents took it as an 
ominous sign when the Buck's Creek Power House recently began gushing water 
from its four big turbine discharge gates late every afternoon during peak 
power periods. They are not accustomed to seeing that so early in the year.
?????The Buck's Creek station, amid flowering dogwood and redbud trees on 
California 70 in the heart of Feather River Canyon, is one of the most 
accessible and visible PG&E facilities along the Plumas County watershed that 
engineers call the "stairsteps of power."
?????When all four discharge gates are open, as they were on a recent 
afternoon, the station generates enough electricity to light 65,000 homes. 
The power is produced by the force of water that falls through pipes 2,500 
feet from Buck's Lake to the bottom of the canyon, where it drives two huge 
turbines.
?????According to Plumas County Supervisor Bill Dennison, the lakes are 
already 17 feet below normal capacity for this time of year. Even with 
additional snowmelt, he said, the lake levels are likely to be nine feet 
below normal. "It looks like a very bleak summer for Plumas County," Dennison 
concluded.
?????When the lakes get too low, Alexander said, remembering the 1987-92 
drought years, the sandy beaches around the Lake Almanor Country Club become 
mudholes and, as water in the shallow lake heats up, fishing becomes terrible.
?????"For the past seven to eight years the people up here have been lulled 
into complacency," said Alexander. "People were in denial. They knew that 
PG&E owned the lake and can do anything it wants.
?????"But the prospect of living up here is so attractive they just kind of 
throw caution to the wind and hope it will all work out."

Others Learning from California's Energy Mistakes 

By JAMES FLANIGAN, Times Staff Writer 

?????For all the agony and anger about energy in California, compounded now 
by the bankruptcy filing of Pacific Gas & Electric, deregulation and the 
transformation of the electric power industry is moving forward 
nationwide--and worldwide.
?????Many electric companies elsewhere are thriving and being recommended by 
investment analysts even as the regulated utility division of PG&E Corp. 
surrenders its management to a bankruptcy court and Southern California 
Edison, a subsidiary of Edison International, remains under heavy threat of 
being forced to do the same.
?????Companies and regulators everywhere cite California's troubles as 
stemming from mistakes they will avoid. 
?????For example, American Electric Power, a Columbus, Ohio-based leader of 
the utility industry, told shareholders in its annual report that 
California's blunders of "insufficient power supplies, total reliance on spot 
pricing and capping of rates for retail consumers even as costs of wholesale 
power multiplied, are not likely to be replicated elsewhere."
?????Indeed, many of deregulation's dangers may be avoided now simply because 
California and PG&E have put everybody on their guard. 
?????California's horrible example has spurred recognition that power plants 
need to be built.
?????And PG&E's collapse sends a message that utility companies operating 
partly in regulated and unregulated environments need to separate their 
accounts so as to better understand the different businesses they are 
managing.
?????Wall Street sees electricity as a growth industry just because power is 
in relative short supply in many parts of the country.
?????"The United States has not built enough power plants over the last 10 
years to meet demand," says analyst Brian Youngberg of Edward Jones & Co., a 
St. Louis-based investment company. 
?????That spells opportunity for companies able to produce low-cost power and 
market it in different regions.

?????Promising Investment
?????Today's favored utilities are those moving to acquire power plants and 
sell power as an unregulated commodity in different areas, even as they cope 
with deregulation and competition in their home territories.
?????The examples of two leading companies will explain a lot about the 
utility business today, why investors regard it as promising and how 
companies and state regulators elsewhere are taking steps to avoid the 
blunders of California.
?????Utilicorp United, based in Kansas City, Mo., is the modern outgrowth of 
a family-owned electric company dating to 1902. Under Richard Green, the 
founder's great-grandson who has been chief executive since 1982, Utilicorp 
went eagerly into wholesale marketing and trading of electricity around the 
world, acquiring companies in Australia and New Zealand, even as it continued 
to operate regulated utilities in Missouri--where electricity remains 
regulated--and six other Midwestern states.
?????Utilicorp, helped by the growth of its Aquila Energy subsidiary that 
trades electricity contracts, has expanded to $29 billion in revenue in 2000 
from just over $1 billion a decade ago. "I've got two companies," Green says, 
"one is a regulated utility, growing 3% to 5% a year and paying a dividend, 
and the other is Aquila, which is growing 20% a year."
?????So he is separating the two, issuing stock in 19.9% of Aquila now and 
intending to spin it off as an independent company within a year. "Investors 
can then have their choice of growth or stability and dividends," Green says.
?????American Electric Power is a venerable pioneer of the utility industry. 
It originated the practice of siting power plants atop coal mines so the fuel 
could be transferred efficiently to the steam turbine boilers.
?????Now its home state of Ohio is going through a three-year process of 
deregulating electricity. So AEP is going aggressively into wholesale 
electricity generation and marketing.
?????Last year it acquired Dallas-based Central & Southwest Co. and now 
markets in Texas, Louisiana and Oklahoma as well as its traditional bases in 
Ohio and Michigan.
?????AEP, too, is going to separate its unregulated and regulated businesses.
?????It's doing this, the company told shareholders, because "it will enable 
investors to value our businesses separately and will improve our ability to 
manage the realities of electric deregulation and to focus on the differing 
capital requirements of each business."
?????Why is that significant? Because PG&E, the holding company that owns 
Pacific Gas & Electric, also has thriving energy trading and out-of-state 
electricity operations within its corporate structure.
?????It built up the unregulated business in recent years by transferring 
proceeds from sales of California power plants and cash flow accruing from 
the state's complex deregulation scheme.
?????But PG&E didn't separate the unregulated and regulated businesses for 
shareholders. And now PG&E's publicly traded stock has lost 77% of its value 
and the company faces a battle in bankruptcy court to keep its unregulated 
assets out of the hands of creditors.

?????Avoiding Mistakes
?????As companies elsewhere try to avoid PG&E's errors, so other states take 
pains not to make California's big mistake of going into deregulation without 
a reserve of electric generating capacity. Ohio is making sure that it has a 
surplus of generating capacity. 
?????The Northeastern states of Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Hampshire and 
Rhode Island, which have deregulated, also have plenty of spare capacity, 
reports Cambridge Energy Research Associates.
?????With electricity in surplus, those states and regions can encourage 
price competition in electricity. But when there are shortages, as began to 
occur last year in California, desperation buying by customers and price 
gouging by suppliers are all but inevitable.
?????A point to keep in mind in the wake of California's disaster and PG&E's 
downfall is that the electric utility industry and the U.S. system are at the 
outset of a long process of transformation.
?????It's not unlike the telephone business that has changed so much in the 
last 30 years, starting from, say, the rise of MCI in the 1970s or the 
breakup of AT&T Corp. in 1984.
?????Yet those years also saw the rise of whole new technologies and new 
companies, even as giants of another age faded and failed. 
?????California and California companies may yet find success in this new age 
of opportunity--and peril--for electricity.

Generators Scrambled to End Pacts With Utilities 

Energy: Even before PG&E filed for bankruptcy, alternative plant owners who 
hadn't been paid in months pursued court actions. 

By JULIE TAMAKI, Times Staff Writer 

?????SACRAMENTO--In filing for federal bankruptcy protection last week, 
Pacific Gas & Electric Co. determined what other power producers had already 
concluded: The state had failed to solve their payment problems and the time 
had come for the courts to step in.
?????In the days leading up to PG&E's Bankruptcy Court petition, a growing 
number of alternative energy producers had also been filing lawsuits, seeking 
to be freed from their contracts with PG&E and Southern California Edison. 
The litigation was triggered in part by a controversial new rate plan imposed 
last month by the state Public Utilities Commission in addition to millions 
of dollars of debt owed to the producers by the utilities.
?????On Tuesday, Dynamis Inc. filed suit in Fresno, saying PG&E owes it $3 
million.
?????Carson-based Watson Cogeneration Co., one of the state's largest 
alternative energy producers, also had filed suit to have its contract with 
Edison suspended. So did Delta Power, which owns five small gas-fired plants 
in California. Both producers are owed tens of millions by Edison.
?????At least a dozen such suits have been filed in civil courts, and lawyers 
warn that more could be on the way.
?????"Tough solutions were not being brought to the equation, which left PG&E 
and others feeling they were better off in the court system," said Jerry 
Bloom, an attorney for the California Cogeneration Council.
?????The court actions come on the heels of an order by the PUC last month 
that Edison and PG&E begin fully paying hundreds of small alternative energy 
producers. But some producers say that a new rate plan issued by the PUC 
would force them to operate at a loss and that nothing has been done to 
address the about $1.5 billion owed to members of the group by PG&E and 
Edison.
?????Lawyers say other producers have served Edison with notices that they 
plan to cancel their contracts.
?????Gas-fired generators account for about two-thirds of the electricity 
produced by the alternative energy group.
?????The California Independent System Operator, keeper of the state's power 
grid, reports that there continues to be a roughly 3,000-megawatt reduction 
in output from the alternative energy producers. The daily sum is enough 
power to supply 2 million to 3 million typical homes.
?????"It clearly shows the problem hasn't been fixed," said Jan Smutny-Jones, 
executive director of the Independent Energy Producers.
?????California is home to nearly 700 producers of alternative and renewable 
energy, which as a group provide more than a quarter of the electricity used 
by consumers.
?????Some of the producers have gone offline or reduced supplies for 
maintenance reasons, but others have cut back because they have not been paid 
by Edison since November or have received only partial payments from PG&E.
?????The drop in output has at times forced the state to purchase replacement 
supplies on the pricey spot market for electricity and contributed to rolling 
blackouts last month. The latter event prompted Gov. Gray Davis to propose a 
plan to get the generators up and running again.
?????Consequently, the PUC established a new rate plan for the producers and 
ordered the utilities to begin fully paying them beginning this month. The 
payment goal would be accomplished in part by slashing the rates that PG&E 
and Edison must pay the producers.
?????But the PUC action appears to have compelled a growing number of 
gas-fired generators to file lawsuits in an effort to be released from their 
contracts with the utilities and be paid the millions they are owed.
?????Bloom contends that the new rate plan will force some producers to 
operate at a loss because it does not adequately compensate for their gas 
expenses. He said he expects generators to challenge the plan in court or 
before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
?????Smutny-Jones contends that the plan wrongly assumes that all natural gas 
used by his members can be piped in from the Oregon border, where the price 
of natural gas is cheaper. The producers, he added, are seeking assurances 
that they will be paid realistic rates by the utilities for future deliveries.
?????Utilities are scheduled to pay the first round of reduced rates, as 
ordered by the PUC, early next week. Both utilities have indicated that they 
plan to make the first round of payments.
?????Edison officials said Friday they have been served with 10 producer 
lawsuits. They say they fear that if the generators are let out of their 
contracts, they could sell their supplies out of state, which could in turn 
cause rates to rise for California consumers because it would reduce supply.
?????PG&E spokesman John Nelson said in an interview last week before the 
bankruptcy filing that PG&E has been served with two such lawsuits. He said 
his company is also concerned about the PUC rate plan and whether it truly 
lowered the rates PG&E must pay the alternative producers and whether there 
would be enough money in the rates paid by customers to turn around and pay 
the producers.
?????"We're concerned that the commission decision does not solve the 
problem," Nelson said.
?????A Davis spokesman said last week that the administration is still 
working on the issue of money owed to the producers and that the 
administration is continuing to work with the PUC to get more generators back 
online.
?????Observers believe the number of producer lawsuits will grow because most 
cases to date have been aimed at Edison. The utility has not paid its 
producers since November and has fought to have its rates slashed.
?????By comparison, PG&E has made efforts to partially pay its producers in 
recent months and to keep them informed of their financial situation.
?????A Bankruptcy Court is expected to decide whether to affirm the contracts 
of producers who sell to PG&E or to free them to sell their power elsewhere.
?????An Imperial County judge has already freed CalEnergy, a small geothermal 
producer, from its contract with Edison because of Edison's failure to pay 
the company. The court has delayed ruling on CalEnergy's request for $99 
million in back payments until April 16--the day the utility is expected to 
begin paying its alternative generators.
?????Since it quit transmitting 270 megawatts to Edison last month, CalEnergy 
has been selling its electricity to El Paso Energy, a marketing company that 
resells power on the spot market. If other generators are able to repeat the 
pattern, it could further reduce state energy supplies, particularly this 
summer, when every megawatt will be needed to avoid blackouts.

PG&E Gave Bonuses Prior to Bankruptcy 

Before its filing, the utility also had $2.5 billion on hand and had 
restarted services suspended earlier because of shaky finances. 

By TIM REITERMAN, Times Staff Writer


????? SAN FRANCISCO--In the days approaching Pacific Gas & Electric Co.'s 
bankruptcy filing, the debt-ridden utility had more than $2.5 billion in cash 
on hand and was restarting services suspended earlier this year because of 
its shaky finances.
?????Then, the day before the filing, the utility awarded 6,000 managers and 
other employees more than $50 million in annual bonuses and announced that 
long-delayed merit increases had kicked in for the same workers.
?????The timing of the bonus payments in particular raised an outcry from 
consumer groups and state officials.
?????"Management is suffering from two afflictions: Denial and greed," Gov. 
Gray Davis said in a statement.
?????"It does not look good," said state Senate President Pro Tem John 
Burton. "They [already] have a business and a P.R. problem."
?????The bonuses and raises were announced in an e-mail sent Thursday by 
Chief Executive Robert Glynn to employees. The payments cover about a third 
of the company's 19,000 workers, ranging from nonunion clerical staff to all 
but the very top management.
?????On Friday, hours after PG&E had filed for reorganization of its debts 
under Chapter 11 bankruptcy laws, a San Francisco judge approved the 
company's overall employee compensation plan. But PG&E officials said the 
ruling did not specifically cover the bonuses or merit raises.
?????Harvey Rosenfield, president of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer 
Rights, said the bonuses should not be allowed.
?????"Talk about manipulating the corporate finances to benefit management 
prior to bankruptcy," he said. "It is the kind of arrogant mismanagement that 
is responsible for the ruin of this company."
?????Richard Levin, a Los Angeles bankruptcy attorney, said such payments to 
employees are not unusual, especially after the filing of bankruptcy.
?????"A company trying to reorganize has to take pretty strong action to keep 
employees," he said. "If they did not do it, who is going to keep the 
electricity flowing?"
?????PG&E, the state's largest utility, declared in its filing for bankruptcy 
protection that it is more than $9 billion in debt--several times more than 
cash on hand--and was getting nowhere in negotiations with the governor for 
state purchase of its power lines and other assets. The filing, which 
includes a list of creditors, allows the company to continue to operate while 
it reorganizes its financial affairs. A judge, working under federal 
bankruptcy law, will determine who will be paid and in what order. The first 
hearing is scheduled for Monday.
?????Company officials defended the payments, which were reported in 
Saturday's San Francisco Chronicle, and fired back at Davis. "Instead of 
focusing all his attention on solving the state's yearlong and ever-worsening 
energy crisis, the governor has launched a campaign-style attack on our 
company," PG&E said in a statement Saturday.
?????The payments, officials said, are awarded each year to employees who 
meet the company's performance goals and objectives. "They are smaller this 
year because of the larger financial crisis the company is going through but, 
it is safe to say, more deserved this year than in years past because of the 
challenges facing our employees this year," said PG&E spokesman John Nelson.
?????The payments came after the company began reversing some of the 
cost-cutting measures imposed early this year after its finances worsened, 
PG&E officials said.

?????PUC Orders End to Some Cutbacks
?????Among other things, PG&E had suspended projects involving the 
underground placement of power lines, prompting cities and residents to 
protest to state regulators. The company also eliminated about 325 jobs 
earlier this year and was planning layoffs of almost 700 more. But the 
California Public Utilities Commission last month blocked the layoffs and 
ordered the company to rescind any cutbacks affecting service.
?????Company officials said that, thanks in part to a tax refund of $1.1 
billion, the company now has about $2.5 billion to $2.8 billion on hand.
?????"We are now in a position to start relaxing some of those 
cash-conservation measures," Nelson said Saturday. "About a week ago we 
started doing undergrounding again and [performing] new installations of 
electrical service" in business parks and elsewhere.
?????"This compensation package was one of those measures reinstated," he 
said.
?????Officials said the payments exempted the company's 25 officers, as well 
as about 12,000 union workers who received raises in January.
?????They said the total of the bonuses, estimated roughly at more than $50 
million, is substantially lower than the $83 million in payments suspended in 
January when the utility announced cost-cutting measures.
?????That $83 million included bonuses for employee performance and a bonus 
based on the company's success.
?????"As we close the books for 2000, we have determined that we are unable 
to make [that] portion of the incentive payment due to the negative financial 
impact of the ongoing California energy crisis," CEO Glynn said in his e-mail.
?????He said the incentive bonuses were awarded along with merit increases 
averaging 3% for all employees, effective April 1. Bonuses commonly are about 
four weeks of salary, officials said, but can vary according to performance 
and other factors.
?????Mike Florio, senior attorney at the Utility Reform Network, said, "That 
is going to be a little hard for the public to swallow. . . . I feel better 
that the 25 [top executives] are not included. Those are the people that have 
run this company into the ground."
?????On Saturday, Davis administration negotiators redoubled efforts to keep 
the same fate from befalling Southern California Edison.
?????Davis hopes for a state takeover of the massive system of electricity 
transmission lines owned by PG&E, Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric. 
However, the bankruptcy complicates that effort, which already has proved to 
be daunting. A federal bankruptcy judge will have to approve any deal that 
involves PG&E.
?????Edison executives and Davis' aides met in San Francisco in an effort to 
strike a deal by which the state would purchase Edison's share of the 
transmission system for $2.76 billion. The company would use the money to 
restructure its debt.
?????Edison has agreed in principle to sell the state its transmission 
system. However, the company is seeking relief from some PUC regulations that 
could later undermine aspects of the deal and could jeopardize the company's 
future financial stability.
?????On Saturday, Burton reiterated his call for the governor to "commandeer" 
two or three power plants owned by out-of-state producers. "These people have 
us by the throat and are making more money than God," he told a news 
conference here. "You have to fight back."
?????Steve Maviglio, the governor's press secretary, said Davis has not ruled 
out such a seizure.

NEWS ANALYSIS 
Shifting Action to Neutral Arena May Be Bankruptcy Filing's Upside 

Court might be a forum in which the state, PG&E and creditors could break 
impasses. But there are many uncertainties. 

By MICHAEL A. HILTZIK, Times Staff Writer


?????By forcing almost all the deadlocked parties in California's energy 
crisis to meet in a neutral public forum, the bankruptcy filing by Pacific 
Gas & Electric Co. on Friday may actually help clear the path to a solution, 
some experts say.
?????But along that path lie numerous uncertainties, including questions 
about the powers of the Bankruptcy Court that have never been resolved in 
practice. Among the most serious booby-traps confronting PG&E is that its 
financial books will be placed under a microscope.
?????"When you initiate a bankruptcy," said Daniel J. Bussel, a bankruptcy 
specialist at UCLA School of Law, "you don't have compete control over what 
happens."
?????The bankruptcy filing removes many of the thorniest questions revolving 
around the energy crisis from an arena that has been hard-pressed to deal 
with them: the political. Because utility policy is important to so many 
constituencies--including taxpayers, ratepayers, consumer activists, 
regulators, and legislators--solving the crisis in a way that is not only 
equitable but meets everyone's political goals has been a daunting task.
?????That is especially so because the crisis actually encompasses two 
separate problems. One is how to restructure the state's energy program so 
that deregulation can be made to work and costs and rates can be brought into 
line; the second is what to do about the billions in debt PG&E and Southern 
California Edison accrued last year from the purchase of wholesale power at 
prices higher than they were permitted to pass on to customers. 
?????The attempt to settle both issues in concert has confounded the state's 
leaders--especially since the question of whether the state should bail the 
utilities out of their debts at all is itself a contentious one.
?????"I've thought for quite some time that our primary focus ought to be on 
how you solve the [long-term] problem, as opposed to how you adjudicate a 
dispute between the utilities and the generators," said state Treasurer Phil 
Angelides in an interview. "Too much time in Sacramento is being spent trying 
to figure out how to ransom the generators' bill. In some ways, the 
[bankruptcy] filing takes those past debts off the table."
?????Angelides said the court might represent a forum where the state, the 
utility and its creditors could examine and challenge those generators' 
bills. That is something that federal regulators, who have jurisdiction over 
wholesale power rates, have been loath to do, despite complaints from PG&E 
and Edison that they have been overcharged billions by profiteering power 
plant owners.
?????There is no question that the filing does complicate matters for many 
participants in the drama over California's energy supply.
?????PG&E's filing, in which it sought protection from creditors under 
Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code, could place more pressure on 
Southern California Edison, the state's second cash-strapped utility, to 
enter bankruptcy as well. That's because electricity generators will be more 
assured of getting paid for their post-bankruptcy sales to PG&E, for which 
all pre-bankruptcy debts are temporarily in abeyance. By contrast, Edison 
creditors have no guarantees that the utility will be able to pay them. 
Edison executives said Friday they had no plans to file for bankruptcy 
protection.
?????On the other hand, it might also inspire Gov. Gray Davis to rapidly 
reach a bailout agreement with Edison, as though to prove that PG&E's move 
was unnecessary or premature. Davis has been hinting that a deal is near. The 
state would buy Edison's electric transmission grid, providing the utility 
with desperately needed cash, but there have been few public signs of 
progress. PG&E had been balking at such a resolution.
?????Among the most serious perils of the bankruptcy filing are those facing 
PG&E itself. Although company executives clearly hope to limit the Bankruptcy 
Court's jurisdiction to the utility alone, that may not be possible, experts 
say. It is likely that the utility's creditors will insist on examining its 
controversial relationship with its holding company, PG&E Corp.--a scrutiny 
that might drive that company into bankruptcy too.
?????Although PG&E had long threatened to resort to bankruptcy, the 
abruptness of the utility's filing at 9:04 a.m. Friday took aback almost 
everybody involved with the energy crisis, coming as it did less than 15 
hours after Davis delivered a statewide television and radio address 
proposing a program to bring rates into line with wholesale energy costs.
?????Even normally well-connected professionals were caught short. The 
research department of the investment bank Goldman Sachs told clients Friday 
morning that PG&E and Edison were on the way to a "return . . . to financial 
health" and hinted their parent companies' shares were poised to more than 
double in price. The research report was released Friday by Davis' office.
?????Instead, PG&E filed for bankruptcy. By the end of the day both companies 
had lost more than 35% of their value.
?????By giving PG&E's creditors legal standing to directly scrutinize its 
finances, the filing leaves the utility's recent business decisions open to 
challenge.
?????Chief among these is the utility's record of "upstreaming" to its parent 
revenues it received from ratepayers in the first two and a half years of 
deregulation. Critics have argued that those payments left the utility 
starved for cash when wholesale rates soared beginning in May 2000.
?????In announcing the bankruptcy filing Friday, PG&E Chairman Robert Glynn 
laid nearly all the blame for his company's perilous condition at the feet of 
the Public Utilities Commission, the governor and other state officials.
?????The company had been "raising the crisis flag [about high wholesale 
power prices] since last summer," he said.
?????Yet an independent audit of PG&E commissioned by the PUC and released in 
January documented that the utility did not implement any cash conservation 
measures until December. The utility even paid a cash dividend to its parent 
company for the third quarter of 2000, covering the months of July through 
September, of more than $200 million.
?????In all, PUC documents show, Pacific Gas & Electric disbursed $9.6 
billion to PG&E Corp. from January 1998 through September 2000. That money 
benefited shareholders, from whom some $2.8 billion in shares were 
repurchased and who received another $1.5 billion in dividends; and 
bondholders, for whom $2.8 billion in debt was paid off. 
?????Glynn insisted Friday that the company has "assiduously complied" with 
PUC rules governing the relationship between the utility and the holding 
company. But creditors are sure to give the transactions another look.
?????"Those transactions will now certainly be scrutinized," said Bussel. 
Bankruptcy court represents "a forum to bring a lawsuit to unwind those 
transactions and get a full airing of circumstances of the transfers."

?????Filing Could Threaten Parent Company
?????While PG&E executives took pains to note that the holding company and 
its unregulated subsidiaries are not subject to the bankruptcy filing, 
experts say that could change if Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali is persuaded 
that the transactions were improper and the money should be returned to the 
utility.
?????"There will be a lot of sophisticated lawyers looking at this," Bussel 
said. "If distributions to the parent are deemed fraudulent transfers and are 
voidable, the holding company would have a huge liability and would probably 
have to file" for bankruptcy.
?????A broader threat to PG&E and the state's energy future is that state 
regulators and Montali might be unable to agree on the rates to be charged by 
the utility. A provision of the bankruptcy law requires that any rates that 
are part of a recovery plan for a regulated utility must be approved by that 
utility's regulators.
?????Although that provision would leave rate-setting authority in the hands 
of the California PUC, in practice the the commission will have to negotiate 
with the judge. Any failure of those negotiations would raise issues that 
have never been resolved by higher courts. 
?????"The judge doesn't have the power to set rates [unilaterally]," said 
Kenneth Klee, a prominent Los Angeles bankruptcy lawyer, "but there are only 
a handful of cases on this."

Shock's Silver Lining 

?????That California's power crisis has been dealt another huge shock is not 
all bad. The bankruptcy of Pacific Gas & Electric has legal scholars puzzling 
over how federal court supervision of the debt-ridden utility will affect 
rate-setting, sale of assets such as the transmission system and the state's 
role in the crisis. And that's apart from figuring out how it affects 
Southern California Edison, the chief private utility in the southern part of 
the state. Despite executives' denials of any bankruptcy plans, will Edison 
be forced into the same boat? Even with all these questions, a good shake can 
have benefits. 
?????There's no doubt that a federal bankruptcy judge has the power to sort 
out at least some of the befuddling problems of the state's energy crisis. 
Few tears will be shed, for instance, if a court-ordered restructuring of 
PG&E's debt trimmed some of the outlandish profits reaped by private 
generating companies that sold power to the utility over the past six months. 
Federal involvement could also force the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
to abandon its hands-off stance on regulating wholesale prices. There is 
bipartisan support in Congress for FERC to conduct a thorough investigation 
of the price spikes that pushed the utilities into default and forced the 
state to spend billions as the power purchaser of last resort. 
?????And what of the utilities themselves? PG&E's award of more than $50 
million in employee bonuses the day before it filed for bankruptcy was a 
terrible political move, but it is not the jackpot issue. The utility's 
transfer of billions of dollars to its parent company even as cash flow 
problems worsened will be a more likely and fitting target of scrutiny by 
bankruptcy overseers. 
?????Not least, the shock of the bankruptcy may also convince Californians to 
take urgent conservation action before the hot summer months. The state must 
also expedite a $1-billion conservation program passed by the Legislature 
late last week. No matter who is at fault, summer blackouts are a certainty 
unless both business and residential customers take energy savings much more 
seriously. 
?????The bankruptcy certainly pulled the rug out from under Gov. Gray Davis, 
who had been trying without success to make a deal with PG&E, Southern 
California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric to buy their transmission 
systems in exchange for state assistance with debts. Just Thursday night, 
Davis had bowed, in a television address, to the necessity for big rate 
increases. He no doubt meant to assure Californians that he was taking strong 
action to solve the crisis and keep the utilities from bankruptcy, but he 
disappointingly offered no new initiatives. In the clearest possible slap at 
Davis, PG&E was at the steps of the Bankruptcy Court the next morning. 
?????However embarrassed Davis must have been by the sideswipe, he should not 
allow anger to dictate his response. He needs to demonstrate he's above such 
pettiness and perhaps even acknowledge that his snail's-pace progress was 
part of the problem. Davis redoubled efforts over the weekend to strike a 
deal with Edison for its part of the transmission system, but PG&E's 
bankruptcy certainly complicates the transaction. 
?????Perhaps it was never possible to deal with the utilities' past debts and 
restructure the state's power at the same time. Bankruptcy is a rough but 
effective tool for dealing with debt, one that might help legislators and the 
governor focus more sharply on future reforms. 
?????Much now depends on the federal bankruptcy judge, Dennis Montali, who is 
known as an effective mediator able to persuade reluctant parties to settle. 
California's economy has survived the power crisis so far, but it is not 
endlessly resilient. If PG&E's bankruptcy speeds debt resolution and focuses 
the governor and Legislature on reforming the state's power generation, 
transmission and pricing systems, business will welcome any increase in 
predictability. 
?????Californians are starved for answers. The federal court's involvement, 
despite the grave circumstances, could provide some.

Use Eminent Domain as a Power Tool 
By MICHAEL J. AGUIRRE

?????Gov. Gray Davis should follow Pacific Gas & Electric's example and admit 
that his electricity program is also bankrupt. The governor's primary 
objective was to keep the utilities from bankruptcy. He has failed. He should 
admit his failure and reformulate his policy. Whatever he does must be based 
on a clear understanding of the problem. 
?????The people of California have a right to buy electricity at fair prices. 
Producers of electricity are entitled to a fair return on their investment. 
Before 1998, a balance between these two points was struck by the Public 
Utilities Commission using cost-of-service pricing. Utilities presented their 
production bills, the PUC reviewed them, determined a reasonable rate of 
return and set a rate high enough to cover both. California became the second 
most efficient user of electricity in the country under this system, and its 
utilities prospered. 
?????In 1996, the electric power industry, with promises of lower prices, 
induced Gov. Pete Wilson, the PUC and the Legislature to reduce the 
commission's power to ensure just and reasonable electricity prices. Under 
the power industry's system competition, not regulation, would set prices, 
and prices would go down. PG&E head Robert Glynn represented it to be a "huge 
opportunity for consumers to lower their energy costs." PG&E, San Diego Gas & 
Electric and Southern California Edison, with PUC approval, then sold 
California's most significant generation plants, its gas-fired units, to five 
multinational corporations. 
?????These five companies led the onslaught on California consumers, raising 
electricity prices from $7 billion in 1999 to a projected $70 billion in 
2001. California authorities have determined that 98% of the price bids 
submitted by these five companies--some 25,000--were based on monopoly, not 
competitive, pricing. Gov. Davis is right: "California's deregulation scheme 
is a colossal and dangerous failure." 
?????No one--not Wilson, the PUC or the Legislature--provided an exit 
strategy if deregulation did not work. Davis has been unable or unwilling to 
come up with one. He failed to get on top of the problem when he took office, 
despite clear warning signs. He failed to see that he cannot finance ever 
higher prices with public funds, and he lacks the resolve to do what he must 
to stop them. His one effort to use tax funds to keep the utilities out of 
formal bankruptcy has failed, with PG&E's filing for Chapter 11 last week. 
?????There are no good choices now. However, we cannot continue down the road 
Davis has chosen. It leads to financial ruin. We cannot rely on private 
companies building new generation plants because the same price gougers will 
control how the new electricity gets priced. We cannot rely on the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission or President Bush. California can only rely on 
California to solve this problem. 
?????As a first step, Gov. Davis should do what he threatened to do in his 
State of the State address: use the power of eminent domain to recover the 
gas-fired generation plants that the price manipulators are using to set 
monopoly prices. He can pay "just compensation" to the owners but not one 
dime more. 
?????The governor should now recognize California's vital interest in 
protecting itself from these prices. Eminent domain is a reasonable tool to 
use to achieve that goal. It has been used in less compelling circumstances. 
For example, eminent domain was used in the early 1980s for George W. Bush's 
investment team to assemble the land on which the Texas Rangers' stadium is 
built, from which he and his partners profited handsomely. If eminent domain 
can be used for private profit, it can be used to protect the vital interests 
of the state of California. The plants should be divested to private 
ownership, but only to companies that are under PUC jurisdiction. 
?????The PUC also should be used to plan how California can move forward to 
an improved cost-based system of regulation. What we cannot do is to continue 
on with the current plan, which is to have the governor set electricity 
prices behind closed doors, working with the very people who are suspected of 
unlawful price fixing. PG&E's bankruptcy provides the governor with a new 
opportunity to move to a more effective program. 
?????The governor should now stop using public funds to buy electricity. He 
should urge Edison to join PG&E in reorganizing under bankruptcy court 
protection. This will allow all parties to contest the unpaid billions of 
dollars of receivables owed to the power producers and their associates. This 
will send a message to Wall Street to stop funding such outrageous and 
predatory practices because they don't pay. 
?????The state attorney general should conduct a criminal grand jury 
investigation into the alleged wrongdoing by the power generators. He should 
also join in the private litigation that asserts that the power producers 
violated the state's antitrust laws. He should follow the investigative trail 
to Houston, Tulsa, Atlanta and wherever else it leads. 
?????Finally, Californians are going to have to make a short-term sacrifice 
to get a long-term gain. The governor's call last week for conservation does 
not go far enough. Each city council and mayor and all boards of supervisors 
should be required to come up with an emergency conservation plan. We need to 
cut consumption to the point where we can meet it with current supply. We 
cannot put an unfair burden on business because this will cost jobs. People 
with lower incomes and fixed incomes need to be protected. 
?????PG&E's bankruptcy filing removes the foundation of the governor's plan. 
He should remember the example of FDR, who likened himself to a football 
quarterback who tries one play and, if it did not work, then tries another. 
But for heaven's sake, try something. We must show our fellow citizens that 
we know how to act effectively in solving this crisis.

Governor, Utility In War Of Words 
Davis furious as PG&E defends bankruptcy filing 
David Lazarus, Chronicle Staff Writer
Monday, April 9, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle 
URL: 
http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/04/09/M
N223519.DTL 
California's energy mess took an ugly turn yesterday as Gov. Gray Davis and 
Pacific Gas and Electric Co. traded barbs over who is to blame for the 
bankruptcy of the state's largest utility. 
In a series of tit-for-tat statements, each side laid claim to the moral high 
ground while insisting that the other had been dealing in bad faith. 
The governor spent part of his time yesterday giving television interviews in 
response to The Chronicle's report Saturday that PG&E awarded $50 million in 
bonuses and raises to 6,000 employees just hours before Friday's bankruptcy 
filing. 
"PG&E's management is suffering from two afflictions: denial and greed," 
Davis said in a brief statement Saturday night. 
In a testy reply, PG&E countered that "instead of focusing all his attention 
on solving the state's yearlong and ever-worsening energy crisis, the 
governor has launched a campaign-style attack on our company." 
PG&E said Davis was criticizing "thousands of men and women who have worked 
tirelessly and professionally through this crisis" and concluded that 
"California would be far better served if the governor turned his attention 
to the crisis at hand." 
Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for the governor, fired back yesterday: "PG&E 
waged a public relations war on Friday. If they're looking for somebody to 
blame, they should look in the mirror." 
Maviglio also said the governor was concentrating on reaching a final accord 
with Southern California Edison Co. for the state to purchase the cash- 
strapped company's power lines for nearly $2.8 billion. 
A last round of talks was scheduled to be held last night. 
"There are a few remaining details to be worked out, but it seems pretty 
close," Maviglio said, adding that an announcement of the deal could come as 
early as today. 
"The governor is spending his time negotiating with a responsible utility," 
he said. 
Along with the Edison deal, Davis spent the weekend huddling with energy 
advisers and lawyers trying to come up with an appropriate response to PG&E's 
bankruptcy bombshell. 
Efforts to stabilize California's dysfunctional electricity market suddenly 
have become much more complex. 
NOT MUCH CHANGED
Nevertheless, while PG&E's bankruptcy is by far the most sensational aspect 
of California's long-drawn-out energy mess, at the end of the day, it doesn't 
really change a thing. 
Consider: 
-- PG&E's financial woes stem from a rate freeze that prevented the utility 
from passing along to customers runaway wholesale power costs. That rate 
freeze and sky-high electricity prices remain in place. 
-- California's energy shortage is primarily the result of the state not 
having built any major power plants for the past 12 years. PG&E's bankruptcy 
does nothing to affect that precarious situation. 
-- PG&E's foray into bankruptcy court does not alter the fact that 
electricity demand is outpacing available supply. California consumers still 
face a threat of daily blackouts when power usage spikes this summer. 
"The crux of the problem is still the same," said Loretta Lynch, president of 
the state Public Utilities Commission. "We face the same challenges we did 
before PG&E filed for bankruptcy." 
She added, however, that PG&E's bankruptcy "increases the uncertainty." 
The utility doesn't see it that way. 
PG&E spokesman Ron Low said California's energy woes are no more uncertain 
now than they were when the company ostensibly was negotiating with Davis to 
find an equitable solution to the state's troubles. 
"California remains in an energy crisis," he said. "As we head toward summer, 
resources are going to be very tight." 
WHAT COULD HAPPEN
In the short run, consumers will notice no change whatsoever. Bankruptcy 
protection will allow PG&E to continue operating as usual while the company's 
creditors line up to receive at least partial payment of outstanding bills. 
Longer term, there is a very real possibility that electricity rates will 
soar if the bankruptcy judge agrees with PG&E that conditions for lifting the 
rate freeze were met a year ago and that $9 billion in subsequent expenses 
must be borne by consumers. 
How much people's bills would rise depends on how the rate increase is 
structured. It would probably come in the form of a surcharge on existing 
fees, 
but the monthly hit to consumers could be limited by spreading the total cost 
over a number of years. 
The big question mark now is how PG&E's bankruptcy will affect various 
political and legislative measures intended to keep California's lights on. 
The state's attempt to purchase PG&E's power lines is obviously finished, 
although a new deal could be negotiated in bankruptcy court. 
Meanwhile, the governor is pressing ahead with plans to purchase the 
transmission systems of Edison and Sempra Energy's San Diego utility -- 
although what the state would do with only a partial power grid has yet to be 
determined. 
"Does it make any sense to have the transmission lines of Edison and Sempra 
and not PG&E?" asked state Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San 
Francisco. "I don't know the answer to that." 
A final accord with Edison this week would validate PG&E's apparent concerns 
that it would have had a harder time limiting backlash to its bankruptcy 
filing if the utility had acted after a breakthrough with Edison was 
unveiled. 
The Chronicle quoted PG&E insiders yesterday as saying that the decision to 
file for bankruptcy had been made early last week, even though senior company 
officials said the move followed the governor's Thursday night speech on 
solving California's energy issues. 
One reason PG&E opted to file on Friday morning was because a final deal with 
Edison was expected at any time, observers said. 
Paul Patterson, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, noted that if PG&E 
had filed for bankruptcy after Edison came to terms with the state, "they 
would be seen as a spoiler." 
ENSUING CONFUSION
In any case, PG&E's surprise filing has left all concerned scrambling for 
footing in the changed political landscape. 
Consumer advocates watched with dismay yesterday as the state's political and 
corporate powers slugged it out for supremacy. 
Nettie Hoge, executive director of The Utility Reform Network in San 
Francisco, said all this finger-pointing will do nothing to ensure that 
Californians have ample supplies of electricity this summer. 
"These guys should grow up and come up with a situation that works for the 
public," she said.

Power Grab -- Some Democrats Favor Seizing Plants

N122655.DTL 
With the prospect that state power buyers could burn through more than $2 
billion a month this summer, some state Democratic leaders are pushing for a 
takeover of private power plants to get soaring prices under control. 
Lawmakers concede that sending state agents to grab the keys of power 
generating plants would be an extraordinary measure. 
But now that Pacific Gas and Electric Co. has limited the state's options 
with Friday's bankruptcy filing and with little hope for stronger federal 
price controls, state Senate leader John Burton and others say seizing power 
plants makes financial and political sense. 
They say they've done the math: Since January, California has spent more than 
$4 billion buying power. That's about $1 billion more than private energy 
firms paid for the power plants PG&E and California's two other 
investor-owned utilities were 
forced to sell under California's botched deregulation plan. At those rates, 
California could soon look like a renter paying the full value of the house 
several times a year. 
Profits of 300 percent are not uncommon for large private generators, which 
provide about 40 percent of the state's power needs. The state could seize 
the assets, compensate the companies and then sell the electricity to 
consumers at cost, advocates of the plan say. 
"We have to do something," said Burton, D-San Francisco, one of a group of 
legislators who urged Davis at a meeting last week to condemn some of the 
plants. "These people have got us by the throat. They're making more money 
than God, and we've got to fight back -- not with words, but with actions." 
Davis himself raised the specter of using his emergency powers to take over 
power plants with a fiery flourish during his State of the State address 
earlier this year. 
"If I have to use the power of eminent domain to prevent generators from 
driving consumers into the dark and utilities into bankruptcy, then that's 
what I will do," he said in January. 
Davis still hasn't ruled out the possibility, but he says it's not high on 
his list of tactics. 
Generators say they would fight tooth and nail against such a grab, and state 
GOP lawmakers oppose condemnation, saying it smacks of underdeveloped 
countries' nationalizing key industries. 
But Burton and other Democrats, including state Senators Don Perata, D- 
Oakland, and Jackie Speier, D-Hillsborough, say the governor's strategy so 
far has left giant energy firms holding all the cards -- and a mounting pile 
of the state's cash. 
Davis had been trying to restore the financial stability of PG&E and Southern 
California Edison after their combined $14 billion debt for electricity 
purchases so damaged their creditworthiness that the state had to take over 
buying power. 
But now that PG&E has sought bankruptcy protection rather than accept Davis' 
plan to buy its transmission lines, the state may be stuck with the role of 
power buyer for years. 
POWERS OF EMINENT DOMAIN
Sacramento lawyer Richard Desmond, an expert on state powers of eminent 
domain, said California could seize generating plants by demonstrating that 
it would put the properties to "a higher and more necessary use." 
"The government has almost unlimited power of eminent domain to acquire 
property," Desmond said. "The only thing the state has to do is pay 'just 
compensation,' as defined under the constitution." 
The state could file a formal suit for eminent domain, a time-consuming 
procedure if the owner mounts a fierce resistance over the transfer price, 
Desmond said. If the state wants to take immediate possession, it can deposit 
an estimate of the just compensation and fight it out later in court. But if 
the state loses, it could be stuck for interest, litigation costs and 
damages. 
Condemnation of power plants would raise a number of unknowns, such as 
figuring out who would manage and operate the facilities. The state might 
also be put into the position of having to seize contracts between the 
generators and natural gas providers. 
Davis spokesman Roger Salazar said the governor's first priority was building 
new plants to increase supply, rather than condemning existing plants. 
State Sen. Jim Battin, R-Palm Desert, said he thought seizing plants was a 
horrible idea. 
"We would become a third world country and start nationalizing things," 
Battin said. "Nobody would ever build a power plant in California again. I 
think that would be a really bad play." 
COMPANY WOULD FIGHT
Tom Williams, a spokesman for Duke Energy, said the company would fight 
vigorously to protect its multimillion-dollar investment in four California 
plants, including Morro Bay and Moss Landing. 
"We would defend our interest and seek a fair market value," Williams said. 
Duke spent $611 million to buy or lease the four plants since 1998, and has 
embarked on a $1.6 billion program to upgrade and expand them. 
Some power companies, however, may find their claims for the fair market 
value of their plants undercut by their own tax filings. Energy firms, 
including Duke, told county assessors last year that the utility plants they 
bought were worth hundreds of millions of dollars less than they paid for 
them. 
Private companies including Duke, Dynegy, Southern Energy, AES Corp and 
Calpine spent a total of $3.2 billion to buy divested utility power plants 
that can produce as much as 20,000 megawatts. 
UNDERLYING PROBLEM UNSOLVED
Williams said taking over the property of private companies would not solve 
the underlying problem behind California's high energy prices: rising demand 
and an inadequate supply of energy to fill it. 
Even if Davis seized only one plant, the move might spur other power 
generators to drop their prices, said Doug Heller of the Foundation for 
Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. 
"As soon as the generators recognize we're ready to go to a public power 
system and take their plants, they may start selling power at reasonable 
rates, 
and we won't have to go down that road," Heller said.

Davis Could Still Show Courage

This is Gray Davis' last chance. He can be remembered for something other 
than his vows that there would be no electricity rate hikes and no 
bankruptcies. But he has to show some guts, take his finger out of the wind, 
form it into a fist and stand up to PG&E. 
Go for it, Gray. Seize a power plant. 
That may discourage private investment in new plants, but if the state can 
build those institutions of darkness called prisons, it can build 
institutions that create light. 
PG&E Corp. Chairman Robert Glynn slapped Davis and all Californians in the 
face by saying Friday that PG&E would file for bankruptcy protection. Glynn 
supposedly took it personally a couple of weeks ago when the governor called 
his company "immoral." 
So he went out and proved he wasn't immoral by giving bonuses to 6,000 
employees, mostly managers, just before he made the bankruptcy announcement. 
Glynn probably considers that loyalty. But unlike many of the great men who 
guided PG&E in the past, he has shown no loyalty to California or its 
citizens. 
Compare Glynn's behavior with that of Frank G. Drum, who was president of 
PG&E during the company's great financial crisis of 1907, when San Francisco 
was in ruins and PG&E was millions in debt. Lawyers told Drum that PG&E 
needed time to recover and should ask for the protection of the courts by 
being put in receivership. 
"There will be no receiver," said Drum. He then pulled PG&E through its 
financial crisis by levying a $10 assessment on each share of the company's 
stock, issuing bonds and using every means he could to keep the company 
afloat. 
Unfortunately, times are different and definitions of honor, morality and 
loyalty have changed. Is Glynn immoral? I don't know. But he isn't a worthy 
successor to Frank G. Drum. 
GROSS & Egregious: Chris Burns says that he remember's Herb Caen calling PG&E 
"Pigs, Greed and Extortion." Burns and others wrote their checks that way, 
and they all cleared. 
Patrick Driscoll says that during the '80s he paid his PG&E bills with checks 
made out to "Piggy." Says Driscoll, "They kept my power turned on anyway." 
You can call them anything, just don't call them to fix a gas leak. 
dept.: Karyn Hunt says that after hearing tirades about all the things people 
do while driving their cars, she's seen the ultimate. "I actually saw a woman 
adjusting her tongue piercing while driving down Folsom near Seventh Street," 
she says. "Ick." 
here: A biker parked his Harley outside the venerable Western Saloon in Point 
Reyes Station. Barroom conversation ensued. The biker complained about all 
the numbers in his life: his Social Security number, phone number, license 
number, e-mail address and passwords. "You can't have just one password," 
said the biker, "because some passwords require four numbers and some require 
five." 
Ah, for the days when the only password you needed was on the back of a 
sleeveless denim jacket. 
tunes: Maggie Lynch, magnificent Muni spokeswoman, was on the scene when an 
M-line car derailed last week. She heard one of the unsung heroes of the 
Metro Rail track crew say to another: "If you can drive that train back onto 
the tracks right away, I will kiss your (butt) right here in St. Francis 
Circle." Train back on tracks, but no busses on backside. 
Cool car: The Peter Witt Italian streetcar has a platform in the rear that 
really deserves a bar, and all the car's signs are still in 1920s Italian. 
The other day a young Italian marveled at "Vietato Fumare," "Vietato Sputare" 
and "Fermata Prenotata." He said the latter had something to do with "a bus 
stop and trying to make a reservation at a restaurant." 
success: Success magazine presents "Success 2001" at the Cow Palace in June. 
Among the successful speakers will be Larry King (numerous successful 
marriages) and Jeff Garcia (successful nonembarrassment to humankind). Bill 
Clinton also will appear, on tape, I presume from the low admission fee. 
"Reg. $225, now only $39." Includes pardon. 
Newspaper recounts are in, and hang the chads. Bush won and there's no chance 
of bringing in Al Gore to negotiate with the Chinese in a language they 
understand, English. You can get rid of those bumper stickers that say "Re- 
elect Gore." 
up: Last week I mentioned former San Francisco school board president JoAnne 
Miller, who was helping her friend Carol Schilling try to get her son Jeffrey 
Schilling released by terrorists in the Philippines. 
Miller called to say that Sen. Dianne Feinstein rose to the occasion, putting 
Carol in touch with the secretary of defense, helping her make a radio appeal 
to the young man's captors and arranging a conference call with the president 
of the Philippines. 
"We're keeping our fingers crossed," said Miller.

Governor, bankrupt utility blame each other for power woes

(04-09) 02:04 PDT LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Gov. Gray Davis and Pacific Gas & 
Electric executives traded acrimonious barbs -- but no solutions -- as the 
state's largest utility headed into bankruptcy court claiming $9 billion in 
debts. 
On Sunday, Davis appeared on two nationally televised news programs to berate 
PG&E for awarding an estimated $50 million in bonuses and raises to about 
6,000 midlevel managers and support staff on the eve of its filing for 
bankruptcy protection Friday. 
``Management at PG&E is just focused upon padding their own pockets, not in 
discharging their duty to serve their many customers in California,'' Davis 
said on ABC's ''World News Tonight.'' 
Earlier, Davis had issued a statement saying PG&E ``management is suffering 
from two afflictions: Denial and greed.'' 
In response, PG&E defended their employee bonus package and took a swipe at 
the governor. 
``Instead of focusing all his attention on solving the state's yearlong and 
ever-worsening energy crisis, the governor has launched a campaign-style 
attack on our company,'' a PG&E statement read. 
The rancor came at the start of a hectic week. A San Francisco bankruptcy 
judge was to hold PG&E's first bankruptcy hearing Monday or Tuesday to 
determine, among other priorities, which creditors will be paid and in what 
order. 
Davis, meanwhile, was still locked in faltering negotiations with Southern 
California Edison, the state's second-largest utility, which also claims the 
state's flawed 1996 deregulation law is the cause of its financial woes. 
Davis is hoping to strike a deal to buy Edison's share of the power 
transmission system for $2.76 billion, which would provide Edison with a 
much-needed cash-flow to restructure its debt. 
SoCal Edison executives have said they would continue negotiations with 
Davis, but weekend talks in San Francisco failed to resolve any of the 
outstanding issues on the table, said Davis' spokesman Steven Maviglio. 
Edison was to file an update on its financial condition with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission on Monday.

(04-09) 06:44 PDT LOS ANGELES (AP) -- California failed to keep its largest 
utility from bankruptcy but the state isn't giving up efforts to keep the 
second-biggest afloat. 
Talks were scheduled to resume Monday on California's bid to buy Southern 
California Edison's share of the power transmission system for $2.76 billion. 
That would provide the company with a much-needed cash-flow to restructure 
its debt. 
Weekend negotiations in San Francisco failed to resolve the ``few remaining 
issues,'' according to Steven Maviglio, a spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis. 
Edison also was expected to file an update on its financial condition with 
the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Gov. Gray Davis' administration also had intended to buy power lines from 
Pacific Gas & Electric. 
The companies say they have lost more than $13 billion since June because of 
skyrocketing wholesale power prices they cannot pass on to customers under 
the state's 1996 deregulation law. 
On Friday -- in a political embarrassment to the governor -- PG&E filed for 
Chapter 11 federal bankruptcy protection from creditors. The company said the 
move wouldn't disrupt power for its 13 million customers. 
A San Francisco bankruptcy judge was to hold PG&E's first bankruptcy hearing 
Monday or Tuesday to determine, among other priorities, which creditors will 
be paid and in what order. 
PG&E has other legal challenges. Companies who sold electricity to the 
utility have filed at least a dozen lawsuits, seeking to be released from 
contracts so they can sell power elsewhere. 
The bankruptcy also may have an impact on the state's tax base. It wasn't 
immediately clear whether PG&E would meet its Tuesday deadline to pay $80 
million in property tax payments to 49 counties. PG&E and Edison annually pay 
more than a quarter-billion dollars in taxes. Edison has said it intends to 
meet the deadline. 
Meanwhile, the governor and PG&E traded barbs over the utility's decision to 
award more than $50 million in bonuses and merit raises to about 6,000 
midlevel managers and other workers the day before filing for bankruptcy 
protection. 
Davis issued a statement Saturday saying PG&E's management suffered from 
``denial and greed,'' and the company replied in kind. 
``Instead of focusing all his attention on solving the state's yearlong and 
ever-worsening energy crisis, the governor has launched a campaign-style 
attack on our company,'' a company statement read. ``Unfortunately, he has 
chosen to aim at the thousands of men and women who have worked tirelessly 
and professionally through this crisis to deliver gas and electric service to 
our millions of customers.'' 
Davis then went on two nationally televised news programs to blast the 
utility. 
``Management at PG&E is just focused upon padding their own pockets, not in 
discharging their duty to serve their many customers in California,'' Davis 
said Sunday on ABC World News Tonight. 
The rancor comes at the start of a busy week, as federal and state officials 
plan hearings on the California's growing power crisis. 
Representatives of 11 Western states will gather in Boise, Idaho on Tuesday 
to discuss regional energy issues. The gathering is sponsored by the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission. 
In Sacramento on Wednesday, the state Senate starts hearings in its inquiry 
into allegations that electricity suppliers illegally withheld power to drive 
up California's wholesale prices. Wholesalers deny such accusations. 
Meanwhile, no power alerts were in effect Monday morning as power reserves 
stayed above 7 percent.

John Mullane, general manager of the San Francisco Public Utilities 
Commission for the past 15 months, has told Mayor Willie Brown he is 
retiring, even though Brown hasn't yet named a successor to lead the agency 
that could play a vital role in helping the city through the energy crisis. 
Mullane, a 37-year city employee, was director of the Water Department before 
he took the post at the PUC, which runs the city's vast Hetch Hetchy water 
and electric power system. He initially agreed to serve as acting general 
manager for only six months, succeeding Anson Moran, who also retired. 
But the PUC has not identified a candidate for the general manager's post who 
is acceptable to Brown. The mayor has said he wants to use the PUC's 
hydroelectric dams and vast land holdings as a basis for building more power- 
generating capacity and creating a regional power authority.

Cheap, abundant coal eyed with new interest 
Published Monday, April 9, 2001, in the San Jose Mercury News 
BY JIM PUZZANGHERA 

Mercury News Washington Bureau 


WASHINGTON -- The skyrocketing price of natural gas, a major factor in 
California's electricity problems, is sparking renewed national interest in 
coal -- and the Golden State has a major stake in its potential comeback. 
Although California's small, coal-fired power plants account for less than 1 
percent of its electricity production, about 20 percent of the state's total 
power comes from coal-burning plants, mostly elsewhere in the West. 
More coal plants are on the drawing board in the region as abundant and 
inexpensive coal has become increasingly enticing when compared with natural 
gas. Gas burns cleaner but is more than four times as expensive and is in 
short supply. 
The nation is hungry for options as the energy crisis threatens to spread. 
But coal's potential to produce more and cheaper power is offset by the 
impact that increased coal burning could have on the environment, from 
thicker haze to more mercury emissions to accelerated global warming. 
Coal, the fuel that powered the Industrial Revolution, fell out of favor over 
the past 30 years because of those environmental concerns. But President Bush 
has touted it as a key to solving the nation's energy woes. In the budget he 
sends to Congress today, Bush is expected to propose spending more money to 
research cleaner-burning coal. Some of the money for the 10-year, $2 billion 
program will come at the expense of research into renewable energy and energy 
efficiency. 
Optimism about the new administration and the high prices of other fossil 
fuels has led companies to announce plans for 23 new coal-fired power plants 
across the nation in recent months. That's more than were proposed in the 
past decade. The announcements, along with a more than doubling of coal 
prices, has fed surging stock valuations of coal companies. One of the 
leading producers, Peabody Group, is planning an initial public offering next 
month. 
None of the new plants are in California, although 10 are in the West. Those 
plants would add at least 4,800 megawatts of electricity to the Western power 
network in the next four years, enough to power 3.6 million homes. 
``To the extent that they expand capacity anywhere in the Western grid right 
now, it's going to help,'' said Severin Borenstein, director of the Energy 
Institute at the University of California-Berkeley. ``But before coal can 
make a claim that it can be the energy source we can depend on, it's going to 
have to prove that it can be more environmentally friendly.'' 
Pollution concerns 
Environmentalists are highly skeptical. They, along with some taxpayer groups 
and the U.S. General Accounting Office, have criticized the Department of 
Energy's existing Clean Coal Technology Program as ineffective and wasteful. 
Although technological advances have nearly eliminated the characteristic 
black smoke of coal, burning it still releases large amounts of carbon 
dioxide, which contributes to global warming, and other chemicals that 
pollute air and water, environmental groups say. 
``Coal is not part of our long-term future, unless our long-term future has 
San Jose underwater,'' said Carl Pope, executive director of the Sierra Club, 
alluding to the rising oceans predicted if global warming continues. Pope 
added that truly clean-burning coal ``is about as likely as cold fusion.'' 
Although there is much debate about the environmental ramifications of 
burning coal, there is no debate about one thing: The United States is the 
coal capital of the world. 
Coal is the nation's most abundant fossil fuel. There are about 250 billion 
tons of recoverable coal in the country's soil, a figure equal to the entire 
reserve of oil in the world. At the present rate of consumption -- coal 
supplies about 51 percent of U.S. electricity today -- there's enough coal in 
the country to last 250 years. 
Backing from Bush 
``For the United States to ignore coal as an integral part of its energy 
policy is the equivalent of OPEC ignoring oil,'' said Jack Gerard, president 
of the National Mining Association, which represents the coal industry. 
The Bush administration doesn't plan on ignoring it. 
``My job and the job of others will be to convince many in the country who 
don't believe we can have a clean air policy and burn coal at the same time. 
I believe we can,'' Bush said in a February speech in the coal country of 
West Virginia. 
Critics charge Bush is selling out to the coal industry. It contributed $3.8 
million to federal candidates in the 2000 election cycle, with 88 percent of 
that for Republicans. The industry flexed its muscle last month when it 
pushed Bush to revoke a campaign promise to support requiring power plants to 
reduce carbon dioxide emissions. 
``They seem to have the ear of important people in the White House and the 
Energy Department. It remains to be seen whether they're going to be able to 
fool the public,'' said David Hawkins, director of the air and energy program 
at the National Resources Defense Council and a former environmental official 
in the Carter administration. 
California's stricter air-quality laws have made building coal plants in the 
state unfeasible, industry officials said. Instead, California has looked to 
coal plants outside the state for power. Los Angeles officials last month 
urged that between 500 and 1,000 megawatts of generating capacity be added to 
the coal-fired Intermountain Power Plant in Utah, which already provides the 
city with a third of its power. 
No in-state supply 
Utah has an in-state supply of coal, as do Arizona and several other Western 
states. Lack of such a supply in California has made coal-fired plants a less 
enticing option here, said California Energy Commissioner Suzanne Garfield. 
Coal industry officials counter that their product is shipped across the 
country. About 3.3 million tons of coal travels by rail each year to Los 
Angeles, where it is shipped to Asia and other foreign destinations. 
A coal-fired power plant would face great opposition in California, even 
during this energy crisis, coal industry officials concede. But coal does 
have the potential to help solve the country's energy problems, Borenstein 
said. 
``Coal, if it can be burned cleanly, is a very abundant source of power,'' he 
said. ``I hope that they can come up with a clean coal technology.''

Leaders threaten to seize power contracts, plants 
Published Monday, April 9, 2001, in the San Jose Mercury News 
BY BRANDON BAILEY 

Mercury News 


While the governor's office continued talks aimed at preventing a second 
major utility from going into bankruptcy, other California political leaders 
said Sunday that it's time for drastic action to bring wholesale power prices 
down. 
With little prospect for federal price caps, some state officials are saying 
California must seriously consider such steps as seizing power contracts or 
even taking over the generating plants themselves. 
``To this date, we haven't done enough'' to persuade suppliers that they need 
to lower their prices, Democratic state Treasurer Phil Angelides said Sunday. 
State Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco, suggested 
seizing two or three power plants to ``send a shot across their bows.'' 
Angelides agreed it may be time to slap wholesale power providers with a 
windfall profits tax -- ``or take a couple of their plants, to give them a 
little dose of reality.'' 
Legislative leaders are also discussing a proposal for the governor to seize 
wholesale electricity contracts if federal regulators refuse to impose a 
regional price cap on power trading in the West. 
In effect, that would let the state buy some lower-priced power that 
generators had already promised to energy traders, who would otherwise resell 
the same juice on the spot market for higher prices. 
Shift in focus 
If the state goes forward with any of those efforts, analysts said it would 
mark a shift in focus. Rather than concentrating on bailing out the 
cash-strapped utilities, officials would be addressing the larger issues of 
what many consider to be a dysfunctional power market in which a handful of 
large, independent companies have earned huge profits by selling power to the 
utilities that provide energy to individual consumers. 
Attorneys for the state's largest utility, Pacific Gas & Electric Co., and 
its creditors are expected to appear in a federal courtroom in San Francisco 
this morning for a hearing on the bankruptcy petition that PG&E filed Friday. 
It is the third largest bankruptcy filing in U.S. history. 
PG&E says it has amassed $9 billion in debt, primarily because of a rate 
freeze that has prevented utilities from passing their wholesale costs on to 
California energy consumers. 
PG&E bonuses 
A spokesman, meanwhile, defended PG&E's decision to pay out millions of 
dollars in performance bonuses to about 6,000 non-union employees last week, 
before the bankruptcy petition was filed. Though critics said the utility 
shouldn't be making such payments at a time when it is crying poverty, PG&E 
spokesman John Nelson said the bonuses went to workers who weren't eligible 
for a pay increase that other workers received earlier this year under their 
union contract. 
The company had planned to award about $80 million in bonuses, but Nelson 
said that was reduced by an unspecified amount in part because PG&E decided 
not to include its top officers in the group receiving the awards. 
Also over the weekend, aides to Gov. Gray Davis continued negotiating details 
of a bailout plan for the state's other major utility, Southern California 
Edison. Under a tentative agreement announced a few weeks ago, the state 
would give Edison nearly $3 billion. In exchange, California would take over 
Edison's portion of the transmission grid. 
The governor had hoped to acquire both Edison's and PG&E's share of the 
statewide grid. 
``It would be much easier if we could get the whole system, clearly,'' said 
Steve Maviglio, the governor's press secretary. But he said the state could 
still submit a proposal to acquire PG&E's portion as part of a court-approved 
plan to reorganize the utility's debts. 
Power producers have criticized the state's effort to acquire the 
transmission grid, and argue that raising taxes or seizing power plants would 
only discourage new plant construction. Spokesmen for several major 
generators have argued that the state should concentrate on reducing barriers 
to new plants or allowing utilities to raise their rates so they can pay off 
their debts. 
But adding to the calls for strong action, Assembly Speaker Pro Tem Fred 
Keeley, D-Santa Cruz, said Sunday that he doesn't believe the state's economy 
can survive what he called ``an undisciplined wholesale energy market'' for 
much longer.

Blackouts this summer? 
Perhaps the timing was coincidental, but Friday's announcement by Pacific Gas 
& Electric that it will seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection served as a dim 
comment on the industry's confidence that California Gov. Gray Davis really 
has a handle on the state's looming electricity crisis. Unfortunately, Gov. 
Davis' speech Thursday evening, while a bit more realistic than previous 
statements in that he acknowledged the need for rate increases, suggests the 
governor is not considering a sensible way out of the problem.

In a conference call with journalists Friday morning the governor fleshed out 
some of the bare bones he offered the public the night before. His proposed 
rate increase is slightly smaller than one the Public Utility Commission 
proposed last week and will hit heavy users harder. He promised that a 
revenue bond his office is still assembling would repay the general fund 
money the state government has spent and pay some utility debts too. He 
emphasized that increasing supply is the only long-term answer and said his 
office is working "at warp speed" to get permits for new plants approved. 
Four small ones should be online this summer. 

But he still sees state control rather than a freer market as the proper 
approach. He said the state would stop buying electricity directly in 2003 
but would set up a new regulatory structure to supervise those who do. He 
acknowledged the need for rate increases but wants rates set by regulators 
rather than by buyers and sellers. 

We might eventually get stability under such a system. But it would be a 
needlessly expensive stability. 

Looming over all is the near-certainty of summer blackouts. 

The latest summer projections by California's Independent System Operator, 
the bureaucratic agency through which most energy transactions in the state 
are funneled, are more pessimistic and more realistic than previous 
estimates. But even these latest projections might understate the severity. 

The 2001 CAISO summer assessment forecasts resource deficiencies for June 
through September ranging from almost 3,700 megawatts in June down to about a 
600 MW shortfall in September. The cover memo notes that "Given this 
forecast, the CAISO expects that load curtailments (blackouts) will occur 
this summer."

Republican state Sen. Tom McClintock pointed out to us, however, that the 
governor took over the ISO board with a flurry of new appointments. Sen. 
McClintock says his staff has heard rumblings of political pressures to 
minimize doom-and-gloom projections. 

Last December the ISO estimated a different "peak power demand" (what's 
demanded with millions of air conditioners running) for each summer month - 
49,462 MW for June, 48,759 for July, 50,829 for August and 47,047 for 
September. 

The March 22 report applies the same maximum peak load to every month "since 
the CAISO cannot accurately forecast when the system summer peak will occur." 
And the figure is at the low end of the previous estimates at 47,703 MW.

The ISO says that "potential demand reductions and possible new supply 
resources are not considered," so conservation measures and price increases 
haven't been included. The report expects the new plants Gov. Davis mentioned 
to come online in June and later.

Robert Michaels, the Cal State Fullerton energy economist, told us there are 
so many variables and so many reasonably valid forecasting models that the 
variances between the two reports might not be all that significant. "In any 
event, this report is plenty scary. Consumers, especially large industrial 
operations, are going to have to make big adjustments in how they use 
energy," he told us.

A report from the respected consulting firm Cambridge Energy Research 
Associates (CERA), headed by author Daniel Yergin, estimat es 20 
blackout-hours during the summer. Only four such blackouts have happened so 
far. 

A newspaper article by Mr. Yergin and Lawrence Markovich, after analyzing 
flaws in the misnamed 1996 "deregulation" scheme says, "Instead of fixing 
these flaws, the current policies from Sacramento are moving California down 
the road to an expensive public power setup and higher prices for consumers 
and businesses."

Robert Michaels thinks industries are already making adjustments and will 
make more when they see the bills they get in May.

By now almost all the reputed experts say there are likely to be significant 
power shortfalls and rolling blackouts this summer. Businesses that don't 
already have backup generators might do well to get them, and to adjust the 
hours in which they use power most intensively. This could be, as Mr. 
Michaels put it, "a summer like we've never seen before."

CERA thinks it will take California two or three years to re-establish 
something resembling reliable energy. It just might take suffering in the 
summer to get state officials to revise their statist plans. 
Nobody welcomes suffering. But at this point it's prudent to expect the 
electricity situation to be worse rather than better this summer.

Pacific Gas Files for Chapter 11



By MICHAEL LIEDTKE
AP Business Writer
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) via NewsEdge Corporation  -
Pacific Gas and Electric, California's
largest utility, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Friday
despite months of efforts by state officials to bail out the
cash-starved company.


The utility's 13 million customers probably will be among the
least affected, since bankruptcy proceedings allow companies to
continue operating while trying to dig out of their financial hole.


But lenders, bondholders and power generators may have to write
off billions advanced to the utility as losses. And the company's
financial reputation could be damaged for years, making it more
difficult to raise money to upgrade transmission lines and plants.


``The regulatory and political processes have failed us, and now
we are turning to the court,'' company chairman Robert D. Glynn Jr.
said. ``We expect the court will provide the venue needed to reach
a solution, which thus far the state and the state's regulators
have been unable to achieve.''


The company, a subsidiary of PG&amp;E Corp., had run up an $8.9
billion deficit buying electricity as of Feb. 28. Like other
California utilities, it has been pinched by skyrocketing wholesale
power costs and the state's 1996 deregulation law barring rate
increases.


As of March 29, the utility had $2.6 billion in cash and
outstanding bills of $4.4 billion. Shares of PG&amp;E Corp. were halted
on the New York Stock Exchange, where they last traded at $11.36,
down 2 cents.


The company provides natural gas and electric service across
Northern and Central California. It has 21,500 employees.


The bankruptcy filing came one day after Gov. Gray Davis, in a
statewide address, proposed relieving utilities' debts by giving
them a share of a record rate increase approved last week and by
continuing to negotiate the state's purchase of their transmission
lines.


PG&amp;E Corp., however, said those negotiations were ``going
nowhere.''


Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the bankruptcy filing was a
complete surprise. He said aides were meeting with the attorney
general's office and bankruptcy lawyers to discuss the
implications.


Consumer activists were quick to pounce on the news as more
evidence that the utility is not getting enough help from its
parent company, which has profited during California's energy
crisis.


``The parent company has $30 billion, much of which it has
siphoned out of the utility coffers. It would have bailed the
utility out,'' said Harvey Rosenfield of the Foundation for
Taxpayer and Consumer Rights.


PG&amp;E Corp. said its subsidiary was forced into bankruptcy
because of ``unreimbursed energy costs, which are now increasing by
more than $300 million per month,'' state regulatory decisions that
are hurting the company and ``the now unmistakable fact that
negotiations with Gov. Gray Davis and his representatives are going
nowhere.''


Southern California Edison, the state's second-largest utility,
was not affected by the filing. Officials at parent Edison
International were meeting Friday to discuss the situation.


Edison International's stock was down $3.63, or 29 percent, to
$9.01 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.


The stock of Sempra Energy, the parent company of San Diego Gas
&amp; Electric that serves 3 million customers in the San Diego area,
was down $2.17, or 9 percent, to $21.98 per share.


The three utilities say they have lost more than $14 billion
since June because of soaring wholesale costs. SoCal Edison and
Pacific Gas &amp; Electric are barred under the state's deregulation
law from raising rates to recover the costs and are having trouble
buying power and natural gas because of poor credit.


In his five-minute televised speech Thursday evening, Davis said
rate increases are needed to help pay for power purchased by the
state on behalf of the utilities. The purchases have cost taxpayers
$4.7 billion since January.


Davis said his tiered rate plan would mean no increase for most
residents and an average increase of 26.5 percent for the rest. The
Public Utilities Commission has already approved rate increases of
up to 46 percent for customers of SoCal Edison and Pacific Gas &amp;
Electric.


The power crisis led to rolling blackouts in January and earlier
this month as electricity supplies dwindled to nearly nothing.


On Thursday, state power grid managers said California will see
more than a month of rolling blackouts for as many as 5 million
people at a time if residents use as much power this summer as last
summer.


The crisis is blamed a number of factors, including high demand,
high wholesale costs and a tight supply worsened by scarce
hydroelectric power in the Northwest and maintenance of aging
California power plants.


The governor has signed contracts and agreements in principle to
secure the state's long-term power needs, committing $53 billion
that eventually must be paid back by taxpayers and utility
customers.

Davis endorses rate hikes, defends handling of energy crisis



By JENNIFER COLEMAN
Associated Press Writer
SACRAMENTO (AP) via NewsEdge Corporation  -
Gov. Gray Davis for the first time endorsed
rate increases for customers of two strapped utilities, while
urging conservation and defending his handling of the state's
energy crisis.


Davis, addressing Californians in a televised speech Thursday,
also lashed out at federal regulators for refusing to cap soaring
wholesale electricity prices that have pushed the state's two
largest utilities toward bankruptcy.


``In January, with the feds still refusing to do their job,
California stepped in to purchase the power the utilities could no
longer afford to buy,'' Davis said. ``We didn't take over to save
the utilities. We took over to keep the power on and the economy
strong.''


California has been hit by severe electricity shortages and
rolling blackouts the past few months. The problem is blamed on a
variety of factors, including deregulation of California's electric
industry which does not allow utilities to pass on to customers
sharply increased costs.


Davis, who repeatedly has said the state can resolve the power
problems without rate hikes, told viewers he now thinks rate
increases are necessary.


His new stance comes after the state Public Utilities Commission
last week approved rate increases of up to 46 percent for customers
of Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co.


Davis said he will propose a tiered rate plan that will mean a
26.5 percent rate increase for the average Edison or PG&amp;E customer.
Under the governor's plan, the heaviest power users would see an
average 34.5 percent rate increase.


``The more you use, the more you pay,'' he said. ``Conservation
is our best short-term weapon against blackouts and price
gouging.''


Davis said the state's power crunch and high wholesale costs are
the result of a ``flawed deregulation scheme'' signed into law in
1996 by then-Republican Gov. Pete Wilson.


Davis urged Californians to help cut power use 10 percent to
fend off rolling blackouts this summer, when residents will turn on
their air conditioners and demand will rise sharply.


The Legislature on Thursday afternoon sent Davis proposals that
would spend dlrs 1.1 billion on conservation programs for consumers
and businesses. Davis said he plans to sign the measures.

Sempra Energy And SDG&E Reaffirm Strong Financial Position in Response to 
PG&E Bankruptcy



SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 6, 2001 via NewsEdge Corporation  -
Sempra Energy and San
Diego Gas &amp; Electric (SDG&amp;E) officials took the opportunity of today's
Chapter 11 bankruptcy announcement by Pacific Gas &amp; Electric (PG&amp;E) to
reaffirm their companies' strong financial position and the
significant regulatory and legislative differences between SDG&amp;E and
PG&amp;E.


"We want to reassure our customers and shareholders that Sempra
Energy and SDG&amp;E remain very strong and financially viable companies,"
said Stephen L. Baum, chairman, president and chief executive officer
of Sempra Energy, the parent company of SDG&amp;E. "SDG&amp;E is continuing
its record of providing safe and reliable gas and electric service for
our 1.2 million customers today, tomorrow and for years to come. There
are several significant financial, legislative and regulatory
differences that distinguish Sempra Energy and SDG&amp;E from PG&amp;E."


SDG&amp;E is covered under Assembly Bill 265, a law signed by the
Governor last September which guaranteed that SDG&amp;E will be able to
collect the difference between the capped price of electricity and the
wholesale cost of power, providing the power was prudently purchased.
PG&amp;E is not covered by AB 265 and that guarantee. At the end of
February, the under-collection in the balancing account was $681
million. Since the state's power procurement agency, the California
Department of Water Resources (DWR), has been purchasing power for
SDG&amp;E, the growth of the company's balancing account has slowed
significantly.


Unlike PG&amp;E, SDG&amp;E has been able to pay its wholesale electric
bills to the DWR, the California Independent System Operator, the
California Power Exchange and Qualifying Facilities that cogenerate
power for the utility. Additionally, the Sempra Energy companies have
no significant credit exposure to PG&amp;E.


"Sempra Energy and SDG&amp;E have long advocated that the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission institute temporary regional wholesale
price caps to help stem the financial problems such as those
experienced by PG&amp;E," Baum added. "We are also committed to promoting
and instituting comprehensive energy conservation programs for all
customers to help control bills and decrease the chances of rotating
outages this summer."


Sempra Energy (NYSE: SRE), based in San Diego, is a Fortune 500
energy services holding company with 12,000 employees and annual
revenues of $5.4 billion. Through its eight principal subsidiaries --
SoCalGas, SDG&amp;E, Sempra Energy Solutions, Sempra Energy Trading,
Sempra Energy International, Sempra Energy Resources, Sempra
Communications and Sempra Energy Financial -- Sempra Energy serves
more than 9 million customers in the United States, Europe, Canada,
Mexico and South America.

Utilities, Environmentalists, States to Discuss Clean-Air Legislation
By John J. Fialka
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

WASHINGTON -- State officials, utility executives and leaders of the nation's environmental groups will hold two days of closed talks this month, negotiations that could pave the way for a significant revision of the Clean Air Act. 
The unusual talks, sponsored by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, will mark a step toward new legislation designed to cut deeply into industrial air emissions and, at the same time, give utilities the "regulatory certainty" they say they need to build a new generation of power plants.
The so-called stakeholder talks, starting next week, are designed to explore areas of agreement among the three groups. Staff members from some committees of Congress and federal agencies will observe the talks to get a taste for the complex politics and economics involved. Power plants produce about a third of the nation's air pollution. 
"This is a multitrillion-dollar issue," said Joel Bluestein, spokesman for a group of five utilities pushing for the revision. "How you sort all this out in a politically charged atmosphere will be very difficult. But it should be a lot of fun." The utilities include Enron Corp. and El Paso Energy Corp., of Houston, Calpine Corp., of San Jose, Calif., Trigen Energy Corp., of White Plains, N.Y., and NiSource Inc., of Merrillville, Ind. 
The "fun" will be closely watched by the Bush administration, which is writing a bill that aims to reduce levels of nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide and mercury. Democrats hope to add a fourth pollutant -- carbon dioxide, or CO2. Scientists believe man-made CO2, currently unregulated, is the largest cause of global warming. 
Adding CO2, "however, likely would produce a sharp political backlash, because there is no cost-effective way to remove it from the stacks of coal-fired power plants, which produce 52% of the nation's electricity. Requiring steep cuts in mercury, which could be expensive, also could cause utilities to switch from coal. Mercury is released into the air in the process of burning coal. 
"That will be a bright red flag for a lot of legislators, a lot of our states and a lot of our companies," said Quin Shae, the chief environmental expert for the Edison Electric Institute, which represents the nation's closely held utilities. Still, he added, the value of the talks "could be very high," because they could affect all EEI members. 
Under the Clean Air Act, pollutants are covered by 19 different programs, some of which overlap and some that have yet to phase in. A multipollutant approach would create one reduction target for a specified pollutant, leaving it up to companies how to meet that target by a specified date. 
In exchange for accepting deeper cuts for emissions, plant owners want a "period of certainty" during which they would be assured there would be no new regulations that would require substantially altering their power plants. 
This approach also could initiate a nationwide regime of emissions trading. If a company reduced its emissions of a pollutant below targeted levels, it would get emissions credits that could be sold to other companies, which may need the credits to help reach their own targets. It would give plant owners more flexibility than they have under current law, which gives state regulators the authority to choose what state-of-the art pollution-abatement equipment a given plant must use. 
The idea for the talks comes from Sen. Robert C. Smith, a New Hampshire Republican who used a similar session last year to broker a law to restore the Everglades. Sen. James M. Jeffords, the Vermont independent who is chairman of the committee, said in a statement that the approach will produce an "aggressive, four-pollutant bill" that he hopes the committee will pass by late October. 
State regulators are split on the merits of emissions trading, because it tends to reduce some of their powers. They also are split by geography. Because weather patterns move polluted air from west to east, northern East Coast states say they can't meet federal air-quality standards without tougher curbs on Midwest states, where there tend to be more coal-fired power plants.

Power buyers in Northwest chase refunds 
Enron and others targeted 
By LIZ SKINNER 
Bloomberg Business News 
WASHINGTON -- Electricity buyers in the Pacific Northwest will ask federal regulators this week to order $2 billion in refunds on purchases that they say were inflated by a surge in energy costs in neighboring California. 
An administrative law judge will begin hearings today on requests by Seattle, Tacoma and other Pacific Northwest communities that bought from suppliers such as Houston-based Enron Corp. The state of California already has said it was overcharged for $1.5 billion of electricity that it bought in the Northwest from December to June, government filings show. 
The cost of wholesale electricity soared in Western states this year during a shortage of power in California, where prices rose fourfold. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ordered hearings on the refund requests and asked the judge to make a recommendation by Sept. 24. 
"The market was dysfunctional," said Philip Chabot, an attorney representing Tacoma and other Pacific Northwest power buyers. "There may be a question of exactly what is just and reasonable, but it certainly doesn't mean you can charge whatever you can get." 
Enron and other power suppliers have said refunds aren't appropriate for the Pacific Northwest because the sales took place under the rules of the Western Systems Power Pool. 
"I don't think anybody has demonstrated any evidence that there was any market power exercised in the Western interconnect," said Mark Palmer, a spokesman for Enron. "The rules of the marketplace, of supply and demand, were at work, and we don't think any refunds are due." 
Palmer noted that Enron is both a seller and a buyer of power in the Pacific Northwest, and if there are refunds, Enron would most likely be eligible for them. 
This week's hearings on Northwest refunds are separate from a Sept. 14 hearing on a request by California to recover $8.9 billion on electricity purchases it made in its own markets. The judge in that case is slated to issue a recommendation to FERC Nov. 5. 
Commissioners in July ordered hearings after buyers and sellers could not agree on refunds after two weeks of talks. 
FERC Judge Carmen Cintron was in charge of documenting the complex sales that took place outside California's market from Dec. 25 through June 20. 
Government-owned power buyers are concerned that existing government controls on prices in the region may actually lead to supply shortages this winter. 
Wholesale prices have dropped dramatically since FERC set price limits for California on April 25. The commission expanded that price-control plan to include 10 other Western states in June. 
Because prices are limited by what it costs to generate power in California, the buyers fear prices will remain too low to encourage suppliers to sell electricity to the Northwest during the winter, when demand surges. 
The Northwest Power Planning Council, a four-state government agency, asked FERC last week to reduce the plan's dependence on California prices in determining controls for the Northwest. 
Soaring power prices in the West earlier this year have forced Puget Energy, parent of Washington's largest utility, and other power buyers to seek rate increases to offset the cost of buying the power. 
Puget has proposed raising customer bills so it can recover $84 million in costs this year. The plan, which would link customer electric bills to the utility's power costs, must be approved by the Washington Utilities and Transportation Committee. 
High power costs in California, where generators had to pay market-based rates to buy power and couldn't pass on the costs to customers, pushed the state's biggest utility, Pacific Gas & Electric Co., into bankruptcy. 
The California Assembly has proposed a financial rescue plan for the state's second-largest electric utility, Southern California Edison, which has accumulated $3.9 billion in debt. 


India: Hardly electrifying

With the spat between the Maharashtra Government and Enron getting nastier and Enron indicating its desire to quit the project, there appears little scope for reconciliation. Successive governments have tested various strategies on the power sector, hoping that one will click. But the State electricity boards still continue to be run on non-commercial lines and private generation projects face innumerable hurdles or get embroiled in controversies, says N. Ramakrishnan. 
"INDIA'S power sector is a leaking bucket; the holes deliberately crafted and the leaks carefully collected as economic rents by various stakeholders that control the system. The logical thing to do would be to fix the bucket rather than to persistently emphasise shortages of power and forever make exaggerated estimates of future demands for power. Most initiatives in the power sector (IPPs and mega power projects) are nothing but ways of pouring more water into the bucket so that the consistency and quantity of leaks are assured..."
Quite strong words these. But coming from no less a person than Mr Deepak S. Parekh, Chairman, Infrastructure Development Finance Corporation, they carry a lot of weight and best describe the state of the power sector as successive governments at the Centre grope with various strategies hoping that one will click. In the meantime, the State electricity boards (SEBs) continue to be run on non-commercial lines and their losses keep mounting. Private generation projects face innumerable hurdles while the high-profile among them get embroiled in controversies. 
Bottomline: The energy deficit increases. 
In the decade of reforming the power sector, there has been one constant: Enron. It dominated the headlines then and continues to do so now. 
And for all the wrong reasons. It was one of the earlier entrants into the power sector when generation was thrown open to private participation. 
Its naphtha-fired plant at Dabhol in Maharashtra was touted as the harbinger of foreign investment. The Dabhol project was also one of the eight fast- track projects that got the Centre's counter-guarantee. 
How the Centre could at all think it was in a position to stand guarantee for the SEBs is beyond comprehension. That only two of the eight fast-track projects have been completed while the third is under construction with the others nowhere near taking off tells the entire story. 
Now, the Enron-promoted Dabhol project is mired in controversies with no one wanting to own responsibility. The cycle appears to have come a full circle as far as the Enron project is concerned. It was signed when the Congress (I) was in power in Maharashtra, as also at the Centre; then reviewed by the Shiv Sena-BJP Government in Maharashtra and re-negotiated and signed again by it; and now the Congress (I)-NCP Government in Maharashtra is keen on scrapping it, with the BJP-led Government, of which the Shiv Sena is a member, in power in Delhi. 
With the spat between the Maharashtra Government and Enron getting nastier, there appears little scope for reconciliation. Enron, after the much-publicised visit of its chairman, Mr Kenneth Lay, also said it wants out. Mr Lay's meetings in Mumbai with those in the Government and the Shiv Sena leader, Mr Bal Thackeray, were not without their share of humour, if you could call it that. After his meeting with Mr Lay, the Shiv Sena supremo reportedly appealed to all concerned to keep the project beyond politics. This must go down as the biggest joke ever as it was the Shiv Sena-BJP combine that made political capital out of the original project, and by "re-negotiating" and signing a fresh power purchase agreement, landed the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, the Centre and the financial institutions in an even bigger mess. 
Then Mr Lay was reported as having threatened New Delhi with US sanctions if Enron did not get back the $1 billion it had invested in putting up the project. This naturally raised much hue and cry. And the next day Mr Lay, in a letter to the Prime Minister, Mr A. B. Vajpayee, denied any moves to seek sanctions. No other infrastructure project in the country could have attracted as much controversy as the Dabhol project did. It could also go down as one of the most politicised projects ever. The Dabhol project's fate has been raised at various fora, and visiting US Government officials as also consular representatives here have not lost any opportunity to highlight this. Their emphasis has always been that contracts are sacred and must be honoured. 
As the US Consul-General in Chennai, Mr Bernard Alter, pointed out at a recent seminar on infrastructure: "The sanctity of contracts is absolutely critical for attracting investment in infrastructure...The signing of a contract should reflect the end of negotiations not the beginning...No investor will want to commit his or her funds in an environment where deals are never really closed, where re-negotiations can begin almost immediately after signing a legally-binding contract. 
Failure to adhere to contractual obligations reverberates throughout the international financial community. The perception of unacceptable risk goes up among lenders each time a contract is abrogated or re-negotiated - raising the cost of funds and thereby hindering the flow of investment." 
This has quite been the story of reforms in the power sector and India's attempt to attract foreign direct investment in power generation so far. Any number of projects have been signed up, only to be held up by innumerable hurdles along the way. Take the case of the 250-MW lignite ST-CMS power project at Neyveli in Tamil Nadu. This was among the fast track projects to get Central counter-guarantee. It took ST-CMS a good seven years from the time of signing the MoU to achieving financial closure. The project is under construction and is expected to begin generation by November 2002. However, that does not mean that it has overcome all the hurdles. 
It must, however, be mentioned that the blame does not entirely lie with the SEBs, whose financial ill-health is often cited as the reason for the lack of progress in the power sector. That charge is definitely true to a large extent. But part of the blame must also lie with the independent power producers, some of whom have taken advantage of the lack of expertise among the SEBs to sign one-sided contracts. 
The IPPs lose no opportunity to underscore the need for transparency in the SEBs, but are hardly transparent when some of their actions come under public scrutiny. 
How else does one explain the Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company's threat to sue the hapless Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) for libel and breach of confidentiality if the latter made public the Power Purchase Agreement. What does Enron have to hide? And, what is it afraid of? True, a confidentiality clause is attached to the PPA, but given the nature of the controversy and the charges made against it, one would have expected Enron to take the lead in making public the PPA. Till this happens, all those things that Enron dismisses as speculative - an exorbitant rate of return, which some in the industry say is in the region of 35 per cent; padding up of costs; spreading the fixed costs over the entire life of the PPA though the debt component would have been cleared much earlier; and lack of transparency in gas pricing - will continue to be cited as reasons for scrapping the project. 
Till recently, the MSEB was touted as the model for other electricity boards, be it in operating efficiency or its finances. However, the Enron project and the populism with regard to tariffs have exploded that myth. It is this propensity of the politicians to tinker with the tariffs of the electricity boards, when it should have essentially remained a commercial decision, that has led to the sorry state of affairs in the power sector. 
The Power Ministry has convened innumerable meetings, to set the power sector back on track. But with the States recalcitrant, nothing happens. 
This is evident from the widening gap between the cost of supply and the average tariff, and the decreasing percentage of recovery. 
The average cost of power, which was 42 paise per unit in 1980-81, increased to 109 paise in 1990-91, to 215 paise in 1996-97 and then to 304 paise in 2000-01. Meanwhile, the average tariff increased from 32 paise per unit in 1980-81 to 82 paise in 1990-91, to 165 paise in 1999-2000 and 212 paise in 2000-01. The percentage of recovery declined from 76.7 in 1996-97 to 69.8 in 2000-01. 
Despite agreeing to levy a minimum of 50 paise per unit on the agriculture sector, the average tariff for farm pumpsets has gone up from 21.2 paise per unit in 1996-97 to 28.48 paise in 2000-01, with a number of States, including the so- called progressive ones such as Tamil Nadu, still providing electricity free to farm connections. 
In this period, the commercial losses of the SEBs with subsidy have gone up by more than four times - from Rs 4,674.31 crore to Rs 20,220.50 crore, while the commercial losses without subsidy have increased from Rs 11,305 crore to Rs 26,013 crore. 
The transmission and distribution losses, which were 20.6 per cent in 1980-81, increased to 21.8 per cent in 1985-86 and to 23.3 per cent in 1989-90, dipping to 21.8 per cent in 1992-93. Since 1995-96, the T&D losses started rising again. The reforming States started reporting higher T&D losses after restructuring the SEBs; they were estimated at 25 per cent in 1998-99. 
The domestic and farm connections continue to be heavily subsidised, with electricity boards levying higher tariffs on industrial consumers. 
However, most States, especially those that have initiated reforms, have realised that industrial tariffs can no longer be raised indiscriminately to subsidise domestic and farm connections. 
The estimated tariff for domestic and farm connections for 2000-01 was 173 paise per unit and 28.5 paise respectively against the average tariff of 212 paise. More worrying for the electricity boards is that the share of domestic and agricultural consumers in the total energy sales has been increasing over the years - from 49 per cent in 1996-97 to 52 per cent in 2000-01 - while the share of industrial consumers, which was more than 50 per cent some time ago, declined from 33 per cent to 31 per cent in the same period. 
Given this situation, it is no surprise that the SEBs collectively owe more than Rs 41,000 crore (principal and interest/surcharge) to the Central power utilities and the Railways. The States know full well that the Central power utilities dare not cut supply and the worst they can do is to threaten the errant States. Would these SEBs themselves continue supplying power to an individual customer who regularly defaults on payment or pays only part of the bill? Thereby hangs another tale?

Northwest U.S. Electricity Buyers Seek $2 Billion in Refunds
2001-09-03 10:49 (New York)

Northwest U.S. Electricity Buyers Seek $2 Billion in Refunds

     Washington, Sept. 3 (Bloomberg) -- Electricity buyers in the
Pacific Northwest will ask federal regulators this week to order
$2 billion in refunds on purchases that they say were inflated by
a surge in energy costs in neighboring California.

     An administrative law judge will begin hearings Tuesday on
requests by Seattle; Tacoma, Washington; and other Pacific
Northwest communities that bought from suppliers such as Enron
Corp. The state of California already has said it was overcharged
for $1.5 billion of electricity that it bought in the Northwest
from December to June, government filings show.

     The cost of wholesale electricity soared in Western states
this year during a shortage of power in California, where prices
rose fourfold. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ordered
hearings on the refund requests and asked the judge to make a
recommendation by Sept. 24.

     ``The market was dysfunctional,'' said Philip Chabot, an
attorney representing Tacoma and other Pacific Northwest power
buyers. ``There may be a question of exactly what is just and
reasonable, but it certainly doesn't mean you can charge whatever
you can get.''

     Enron and other power suppliers have said refunds aren't
appropriate for the Pacific Northwest because the sales took place
under the rules of the Western Systems Power Pool. Lawyers for the
group of sellers didn't return calls seeking comment.

                         Second Case

     This week's hearings on Northwest refunds are separate from a
Sept. 14 hearing on a request by California to recover $8.9
billion on electricity purchases it made in its own markets. The
judge in that case is slated to issue a recommendation to FERC on
Nov. 5.

     Commissioners in July ordered hearings after buyers and
sellers were unable to agree on refunds after two weeks of
unsuccessful talks.

     FERC Judge Carmen Cintron was charged with documenting the
complex sales that took place outside California's market from
Dec. 25 through June 20. Establishing a record ``will help the
commission to determine the extent to which the dysfunctions in
the California markets may have affected decisions in the Pacific
Northwest,'' FERC said in July.

     Government-owned power buyers are concerned that existing
government controls on prices in the region may actually lead to
supply shortages this winter.

                         Falling Prices

     Wholesale power prices have dropped dramatically since FERC
set price limits for California April 25. FERC expanded that price-
control plan to include 10 other Western states in June.

     Because prices are limited by what it costs to generate power
in California, the buyers are concerned prices will remain too low
to encourage suppliers to sell electricity into the Northwest
during the winter, when demand surges.

     The Northwest Power Planning Council, a four-state government
agency, asked FERC on Aug. 30 to reduce the plan's dependence on
California prices in determining controls for the Northwest.

     ``The price caps as currently constructed might prove to be
so low next winter that they would discourage generators from
selling power in the Northwest if we have an emergency,'' said
Larry Cassidy, chairman of the council.

     Soaring power prices in the West earlier this year have
forced Puget Energy Inc., parent of Washington's largest utility,
and other power buyers to seek rate increases to offset the cost
of buying the power.

     Puget has proposed raising customer bills so it can recover
about $84 million in power costs this year. The plan, which would
link customer electric bills to the utility's power costs, must be
approved by the Washington Utilities and Transportation Committee.

     High power costs in California, where generators had to pay
market-based rates to buy power and couldn't pass on the costs to
customers, pushed the state's biggest utility, Pacific Gas &
Electric Co., into bankruptcy.

     The California Assembly has proposed a financial rescue plan
for the state's second-largest electric utility, Southern
California Edison, which has accumulated $3.9 billion in debt.



India: Oil giant seeks offshore expansion

09/03/2001
BBC Monitoring
Source: PTI news agency, New Delhi, in English 1111 gmt 3 Sep 01/BBC Monitoring/(c) BBC

Text of report by Indian news agency PTI 
New Delhi, 3 September: After putting a 400m dollar takeover bid for US energy major Enron's 30 per cent stake in Panna-Mukta and Tapti oil and gas fields, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) has now sought operatorship of the offshore fields on the west coast.
"We want to step in (as operator) after the exit of Enron from Panna-Mukta and Tapti fields. We have written to government for operatorship," ONGC Chairman and Managing Director Subir Raha told PTI here. 
ONGC's bid for operatorship comes in the wake of reports about Enron favouring third party sale of its stake instead of selling it to joint venture partners ONGC or Reliance. 
ONGC holds 40 per cent stake in the fields, which produce around 300 million cu.m. of gas and 29,000 barrels of oil per day, and logically should be vested with operatorship, Raha said. 
Panna-Mukta and Tapti fields, operated by Enron, were discovered by ONGC but where given on contract to private party on a product sharing basis, he said. 
Raha said ONGC had put in its price bid but was yet to hear from Enron on the issue. "In case Enron stake goes to a third party, we would like to take over the operatorship." 
Reliance Industries, which holds 30 per cent stake in the 900m dollar venture, has also bidded for Enron stake. Besides, US energy Marathon and British Gas are also in race. 
Enron officials are tight-lipped about the whole process saying "it is not the company's policy to comment on divestiture proceedings." 
A British Gas India Pvt Ltd spokesperson confirmed that it was in running for Enron stake, but declined to give details. 
Earlier, state-owned Indian Oil Corporation and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd also expressed interest in stepping in Enron's shoes, but their bids were rejected by the Houston-based company during the preliminary round itself, sources said. 
ONGC had the required experience and expertise of operating the fields, Raha said, adding, "I am hopeful the government would decide in our favour." 
Enron Oil and Gas India Ltd (EOGIL), the operator of the joint venture, had in October last year sought government permission to withdraw from the Panna-Mukta and Tapti fields as part of its asset rebalancing exercise. 
It had recently mandated Credit Suisse First Boston to derive current value of its stake in the joint venture and evaluate the bids. 
As per JV agreement, EOGIL would need government nod on the prospective buyer though production sharing contract did not provide for first right of refusal to other partners. 
ONGC officials said the corporation had hired merchant banker N M Rothschild India as its consultant for the two-stage bidding process comprising of non-binding expression of interest (EoI) and a detailed financial bid.

QATAR: Qatar, Dolphin to sign final gas pact by early Oct.
By Kedar Sharma

09/03/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

DOHA, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Qatar and Dolphin Energy Ltd (DEL) are set to leap ahead on their landmark gas deal, with final signing of a production pact set for early October and upstream development work targeted for year end. 
Qatari and Dolphin sources said by early next month they will ink a development and production sharing agreement (DPSA) for the $3.5 billion project to route two billion cubic feet (56.63 million cu metres) per day of Qatari gas to the United Arab Emirates.
A comprehensive term-sheet, specifying the commercial terms of the deal, was signed by Qatar Petroleum (QP) and DEL in mid March. It was agreed then to convert the term-sheet into a 25-year DPSA by June. 
But Qatari officials said the DPSA's formal signing was delayed after US-based Enron Corp in May pulled out of DEL - majority owned by the UAE's Offsets Group (UOG). 
A DEL source said there was no real delay, adding that drafting such a huge document was time consuming. 
In any case, both sides are keen to wrap up the search for Enron's replacement. 
"We hope DEL will be able to choose a partner to replace Enron soon," a Qatari official told Reuters. 
For its part, Abu Dhabi last month shortlisted five international oil companies - ExxonMobil , BP , Royal Dutch/Shell , Conoco and Occidental - in the race for Enron's 24.5 percent stake. 
UOG is due to start talks with the firms at the end of September with a view to choosing a single replacement for Enron by the end of the year, the DEL source said. 
QP has meanwhile identified a block in the North Field - the largest single reservoir of gas in the world - for DEL, Qatari officials said. 
Under the deal, DEL will drill 16 wells, build a production plaftform and transport wet gas to Ras Laffan where it will set up a treatment plant to strip condensate, sulphur, natural gas liquids (NGLs) and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) from the wet gas. 
The stripped products will belong to QP and the dry gas will be taken by DEL via a 350 km (217.5 miles) pipeline to Taweelah in Abu Dhabi. 
DEL will bear all costs and pay $1.30 per million British thermal unit (BTU) to QP for the dry gas it takes. 
First deliveries to Taweelah are expected in late 2004 or early 2005. DEL has already invited engineering and construction management firms to prequalify for five contracts.

INDIA PRESS: Enron's Troubles May Hit FDI - Ernst & Young

Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- The Indian government's failure to honor its counterguarantee for the U.S. energy company Enron Corp.'s (ENE) Dabhol power project could restrict future foreign investment in India, reports the Hindu Business Line, quoting consultancy firm Ernst & Young India Chairman K.N. Memani. 
"The Enron imbroglio, where the sovereign guarantee wasn't honored, will have a damaging effect. It will definitely affect the flow of foreign direct investment, which is already very thin," the newspaper quotes Memani as saying.
At $2.9 billion, Dabhol is the single largest foreign investment in India. Enron holds a controlling 65% stake in Dabhol Power Co., which owns a 740-megawatt power plant in the western state of Maharashtra. 
The Dabhol plant has been inoperative since May 29 after its sole buyer, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, stopped drawing electricity, saying the DPC tariffs were "exorbitant and unaffordable." 
MSEB also refused to pay several of its electricity bills. To date, MSEB owes more than $48 million to DPC. 
The Dabhol-MSEB dispute is being fought in the courts. The Indian government asked the two companies to sort out their dispute before it would consider any payment from federal coffers.

FOXES GUARDING THE HENHOUSE? CHENEY STONEWALLS ON ENERGY PLAN'S ORIGINS
Joe Garcia

South Florida Sun-Sentinel

(Copyright 2001 by the Sun-Sentinel)

Big Oil and other energy interests pumped almost $65 million into the campaigns of candidates for federal office during the 2000 election cycle. Republicans received 75 percent of these contributions, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. George W. Bush was the largest single recipient of Big Oil cash. He received almost $2.9 million, while his energy secretary, Spencer Abraham, a former senator from Michigan, received almost a half million dollars. 
During last year's presidential campaign, then-candidate Bush said that he would work with his brother, Jeb, to support an offshore oil drilling ban in Florida. However, in his first hundred days as president, Bush decided to move forward with plans to permit Chevron to drill for oil off Florida's pristine coastline. Since the Johnson administration, the federal government has approved 38 offshore leases: One by the Johnson administration, one by the Carter administration, and 36 by the Reagan-Bush administration.
However, almost as quickly as the U.S. Supreme Court appointed Bush our president, he embarked on a course to pay back Big Oil's generosity. A group of White House aides calling themselves the "National Energy Policy Development Group," headed by Vice President Dick Cheney, formulated what the administration has dubbed a National Energy Policy, which was announced by President Bush on May 17. The group recommended oil drilling off the Florida and California coasts, as well as in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. 
As part of its oversight function, the General Accounting Office is requesting that the Office of the Vice President provide certain documents relating to the process by which this National Energy Policy was developed. Thus far, Vice President Cheney has stonewalled the GAO request. 
The General Accounting Office is empowered to assist the Congress in exercising its responsibilities to oversee, investigate and legislate. The records request will assist the GAO in determining how the White House's energy-working group spent public funds, how it carried out its activities, who was consulted, and whether the law was followed. 
This is the first White House in history to refuse to provide such information to the GAO. This refusal is particularly troubling, considering that this administration has such strong ties to the energy industries, particularly Big Oil. Cheney was the chairman and chief executive officer of Halliburton, the world's largest oil field services and construction company. The company is also the nation's fifth largest military contractor. 
When Cheney resigned from Halliburton after only five years of service to run for vice president, he took with him a retirement package worth over $13 million. 
The Enron Corp., a Houston-based oil and natural gas company, was one of the largest contributors to Bush's presidential campaign. Enron's chair and CEO, Kenneth Lay, was a "Bush Pioneer," personally raising more than $550,000 to aid Bush's presidential aspirations; the company also contributed $100,000 to Bush's inaugural committee. During the 2000 election cycle, Enron contributed more than $2.3 million to federal office seekers -- 72 percent of it to the GOP. In addition, Exxon-Mobil, BP Amoco, El Pasco Corp, Chevron Corp, and Halliburton contributed $5.2 million, again approximately 80 percent of this total flowed into Republican coffers. 
In addition to the controversy surrounding whether Chevron should be permitted to drill for oil off Florida's coast, Bush's national security adviser, Condolezza Rice, was a member of the Chevron board of directors, . which named an oil tanker after her. 
Therefore, the GAO has a most compelling reason to exercise authority over the Bush administration's National Energy Policy Development Group. If Cheney continues to stonewall, the GAO can and should take him to court. 
We have a right to know who really formulated this administration's energy policy. 
Joe Garcia is a Miami-based public affairs consultant and conservationist.

Texas Residents Targets in Ad Battle of Retail Electricity Providers
Laura Goldberg

09/02/2001
KRTBN Knight-Ridder Tribune Business News: Houston Chronicle - Texas
Copyright (C) 2001 KRTBN Knight Ridder Tribune Business News; Source: World Reporter (TM)

In recent weeks, a Green Mountain Energy billboard, a New Power television commercial or a Shell Energy newspaper ad may have caught your eye. 
For a moment, you may have wondered about the product being hawked. Likely you didn't give it a second, or even first, thought.
Soon it will be much more difficult to ignore the advertising and marketing from companies looking to sell you the electricity that powers your lights and air conditioner. 
As Texas moves closer to the Jan. 1 start of electricity deregulation, power providers are busy readying significant marketing campaigns. 
The state is also continuing its branded effort, Texas Electric Choice, which is aimed at teaching residents about deregulation. The Legislature set aside $36 million over four years for consumer education. 
Expect to be blitzed on every front: phone, mail, TV, radio and Internet. Energy sellers are likely to show up at malls, festivals or your workplace. 
A television or radio ad aimed at getting a company's name out there may be followed up with detailed offers in the mail or newspaper. 
In states where deregulation is already under way, consumers have seen a lot of targeted, direct mail and local tie-ins with community groups such as PTAs and Girl Scout troops, said Jerry Alderson, president of Wattage Monitor. His company runs a Web site, wattagemonitor.com, that helps consumers compare competing electricity offers. 
"About the only local marketing we haven't seen elsewhere yet are bake sales," Alderson said, only half-joking. 
Getting consumers to move to new providers isn't necessarily an easy process. 
First, customers must be aware that they have a choice and be comfortable enough to exercise it. 
Then, a company must set itself apart from competitors, each of which is selling a commodity that has few, if any, features that are obviously distinguishing. 
Consumers will have to pay close attention, evaluating whether savings claims add up and apply to their individual circumstances. They'll also have to be vigilant about scouring the fine-print details of any offers. 
Electricity sellers will use marketing and advertising to give themselves identities. Some will brand themselves as the cheapest, while others will claim the best customer service and most innovative products. 
"We've gotten indications there are significant segments of the market that want superior service and are not just solely focusing on price," said Jim Niewald, director of marketing for First Choice Power, a unit of utility Texas-New Mexico Co. 
First Choice -- with its "energy with a smile" slogan -- is trying to position itself as easy to do business with. 
Companies will try to play on emotions, invoking words such as trust and reliability. Specialty players will offer power produced by wind, rather than fossil fuels. 
Several sellers have drawn executives from marketing powerhouses such as Procter & Gamble Co. to help them craft images. 
A couple of providers already have begun full-throttle brand-building efforts, while others are waiting until the fall or later to start in earnest. 
"Consumers will see a tremendous variety in marketing and media messages," predicted Jim DeLong, said vice president of retail markets for Entergy Solutions, an arm of New Orleans-based utility Entergy Corp. , a New Orleans-based utility. "Some companies will invest heavily in advertising with television, radio and newspaper ads. Others will focus more on direct marketing where they will touch customers through mail and telephone." 
Reliant Energy will work to fend off the competition in Houston and plans it own local advertising effort, including TV ads. 
"We're trying to retain everybody in Houston," said Jim Burke, vice president of Reliant Energy Residential Services. "We want to make sure we're not crowded out when our competitors come in." 
At the start of next year, Houstonians, along with most other Texans, will be able to select their power providers. Reliant Energy will no longer hold a monopoly here. 
A pilot program designed to let various players test out systems is already under way. Up to 5 percent of Reliant's residential customers can participate. Six providers have signed up enough residential consumers to fill about 90 percent of those slots. 
Several, such as New Power Co. and Green Mountain Energy Co., aggressively worked to lure as many participants as possible, advertising through a variety of channels, including television and telemarketing. 
Reliant has made a strong effort in the Dallas area, airing three different TV spots, giving away trinkets at various events such as Mavericks' basketball games, and speaking to employees at their workplaces. 
They are already working to imprint their brands in consumers minds, even though most potential customers won't even consider making a switch until days, or even months, after the market opens next year. 
"We want to and need to establish ourselves in the Texas market right away. We wanted to learn about this marketplace real-time in 2001," said Dermott Ryan, the vice president of brand management and online marketing for Purchase, N.Y.-based New Power. 
Others, such as TXU Energy Services, a unit of TXU Corp., the Dallas-based utility serving the upper third of Texas, set small targets for pilot enrollment. 
TXU, which will later expand on its direct mail and telemarketing with TV and other efforts, viewed the pilot as a chance to make sure everything is set to go for January. 
Each strategy has pluses and minuses. Those out early may get a jump on brand-building, but they also run the risk of being identified with delays and glitches the pilot has brought. 
The pilot was to start June 1, but computer problems at the state's power grid operator delayed it until July 31. Even still, continuing glitches mean some in the pilot might not start getting power from their new providers until as late as the end of October. 
Reliant slowed its efforts to sign up customers outside of Houston because of uncertainties related to the pilot. 
"The delays have made most of the market participants a little more cautious with respect to the amount of marketing activity," Burke said. 
Though some providers won't reveal details of their going-forward strategies for fear of tipping competitors, it's clear the players have varied approaches. 
New Power, a national company without ties to any of the state's utilities, is touting savings. 
Its newspaper and billboard advertising feature ballots asking consumers to choose between "burning" money by staying with Reliant or calling New Power. Its direct mail pieces cite specific dollar amounts average Reliant customers could save by switching. 
That saving-money message -- also stressed in New Power's TV ads --is "the first entry point for people to pay attention," Ryan said. 
New Power is also creating new products, including one that lets consumers adjust their thermostats via the Internet when they're not home, and is testing a range of incentives, including Continental Airlines frequent-flier miles, to entice people. 
New Power, which is 45 percent owned by Houston-based Enron Corp., isn't doing much leveraging off that connection other than marketing to Enron employees. 
"We are independent," Ryan said. 
While Shell Energy has also run newspaper ads citing specific savings for Reliant customers, its brand is already established. 
That means Shell can promote itself as a trustworthy company that's been around for 100 years, along with offering savings, said Jeanne Verkinnes, marketing manager for Shell Energy. 
Other providers, including Reliant, TXU and First Choice are pushing customer service, new products and reliability, though they aren't ignoring price. 
TXU is investing $100 million in building back-office operations such as call centers and data-tracking systems, all aimed at providing superior customer service and new products, said Rob McCoy, president of TXU Energy Services. 
TXU, exhorting potential customers to "expect more," is already known for reliability and high customer satisfaction levels, McCoy said. 
It will design offers and new services -- such as giving customers a choice of billing dates -- around those themes. 
McCoy knows a little bit about working in a newly deregulated industry. He spent 30 years in telecommunications and his marketing team includes a few ex-Procter & Gamble employees. 
Elsewhere, Wattage Monitor's Alderson has found price is the biggest driver of customer switching. His research, though, also reveals incumbents come into deregulation with an advantage. 
Consumers may say they are angry with their utility, but once they actually have a choice many customers won't automatically jump ship. 
They concluded, he said: "OK, now I can punish them if they ever do it to me again. I can switch." 
Reliant, the local incumbent, faces a different environment here and in the rest of Texas. Outside Houston, it sets prices as it wants. 
But in Houston, the state's deregulation law requires Reliant to cut its rates once the market opens in January. The prices are expected to be set in October. 
To help spur competition, Reliant won't be allowed to cut its base rates again for three years or until it loses 40 percent of its customers, though adjustments for fuel costs will be allowed. 
Much of Reliant's branding will be similar statewide. 
TV ads shot recently to air in Houston feature "Tom" from Reliant Energy mingling with real residents, not actors. Tom also starred in Reliant's three spots that have run in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. 
The Metroplex ads introduced both Reliant and electric choice and pushed lower rates and better service. 
It was with deregulation in mind that Reliant decided to pay about $285 million over 30 years, around $9.5 million a year, to put its name on all the facilities at the Astrodome complex, including the new football stadium. Even though Reliant stressed ratepayer money wasn't being used, some consumers were angry. 
But in a deregulated world, Reliant needs to make sure it has its share of the "media message," Burke said. And sports fans in Houston and elsewhere in Texas will hear about football at Reliant Stadium and the rodeo at Reliant Astrodome. 
Several of Reliant's competitors were also interested in the naming rights, Burke said, adding that well-funded market entrants will certainly spend significantly more than $9.5 million a year each marketing here. 
Statewide, Reliant will focus on customer service, as Burke stressed "branding is much bigger than advertising." It includes a successful series of customer interactions, ranging from initial telephone contact to finding information on the Internet to billing, he said. 
"The electron is not something the customer cares about at all," he said. "What we can distinguish is the service around the electron." 
Green Mountain disagrees. Unlike others, it occupies a unique niche: selling wind-produced power. 
Its rates aren't the cheapest, and they aren't even always less than the incumbent, but it's seeking consumers concerned about the environment. 
The company does a lot of "on the ground" direct selling, said John Savage, chief marketing officer. 
It sponsors and participates in community-based events, including, but not limited to, those tied to clean air such as a recent solar car race. 
The Austin-based company also relies on traditional marketing methods such as direct mail and television, where a spot features children talking about their desire for clean air. 
"One of the things that we've learned is there are no short cuts to branding," said Savage, a former software company executive. "Branding is really kind of a marathon, not a sprint. Our push is kind of going and continuing."

LOCAL
ENRON PROJECT REVIEW BEGINS AGENCIES, ACTIVISTS TO GIVE VIEWS ON CALYPSO PIPELINE
Antonio Fins Business Writer

(Copyright 2001 by the Sun-Sentinel)

Broward County public officials and conservationists as well as energy industry peers and rivals are lining up to take a close look at -- and ask questions about -- a planned 90-mile pipeline from the Bahamas to Fort Lauderdale. 
In July, Enron Corp. filed papers with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission asking permission to construct the $400 million Calypso Pipeline to transport natural gas from Freeport to Port Everglades.
Now a slew of groups, agencies and authorities have filed requests with the federal agency to study and comment on the project. The review process is expected to drag through next year as the government agency meets and exchanges information with entities on its list of interested parties. 
Among those in line are Broward County and Port Everglades officials who want to know more about the project's possible effect on wetlands and beaches as well as potential safety hazards at the port. 
"We have an interest as a business, as the port, and also to protect the interests of the local government," said Melissa Anderson, the county attorney who filed the document with the regulatory commission. "Unless we intervened we would not have status as a party." 
Broward is also waiting to receive an alternative pipeline proposal from another company, El Paso Corp. 
According to its filing in the Enron regulatory commission docket, El Paso would offer a pipeline proposal that rivals Enron's. But Houston-based El Paso has not yet filed a detailed project outline with the federal agency. 
Nevertheless, Anderson said the county expects to receive a proposal from El Paso and she said Broward officials would then weigh each bid in an open process before choosing one. 
She said the bid effort is important because the commission has said it will consider local government preferences and decisions. 
Enron spokesman John Ambler said the company has already told the county it will join that process. 
"We have submitted a letter of interest to the county," Ambler said. "If we can work it out this way, we will." 
He said Enron is eager to discuss all issues, particularly safety questions. For example, Ambler said the pipeline would be safe to operate partly because it will be buried as deep as 30 feet below the floor of the port's waterway. He also said the area in question is already laced with other pipelines. 
Ambler said Enron expected its proposal would draw significant interest from the industry and community. He said the key issue is that, so far, no one has objected to the pipeline. 
"The intervenors are in large part getting additional information and willing to supply information in the process," Ambler said. "The important thing is that people are not opposing the project." 
But some groups are voicing skepticism as they pore through plans for the 24-inch diameter pipeline. 
For example, a Hollywood-based group, Save Our Shores, worries that the path of the pipeline crosses through a piece of John U. Lloyd State Recreation Area. 
"It raises ecological questions at the park. It raises safety questions at the park," said Sara Case, the group's energy impact coordinator. "Do you really want a pipeline running through that park?" 
The Florida Natural Gas Association is concerned that the pipeline will serve mainly the needs of the electric utilities, a result the association says could drive up natural gas prices. 
Other filings take a more welcoming tone. Texaco Gas International Inc., a unit of the industry giant, said the pipeline might provide access to markets for its natural gas-producing operations. 
Anyone interested in reviewing Enron's plans can access the company's filing at www.ferc.gov. Or they can view a display on the project at the Paul DeMaio Branch Library at 485 S. Federal Highway in Dania Beach.

State fights 6,000 firms' energy deals / Discount power contracts deemed unfair to consumers

Thousands of California businesses may reap cost breaks on electricity while other utility customers live with record rate hikes if the state lets stand a spurt of last-minute contracts with private power suppliers. 
More than 6,000 firms, including big retail chains and industrial plants, signed discounted power contracts in July and August as market prices dropped.
State officials are incensed, saying the private "direct access" contracts with electricity providers could shift the burden for millions of dollars in state power purchases onto households and small businesses. 
State Treasurer Phil Angelides said the same companies that benefited as the state depleted its budget surplus to keep the lights on now want to escape paying their share of the billions spent to ensure power supplies for California. 
"I think it's wrong and it's immoral," Angelides said. 
State officials argue that the summer contracts can still be canceled retroactively because California businesses were on notice that their option to shop around for better deals on electricity was about to be suspended by the state Public Utilities Commission. The PUC is set to consider the retroactive ban Thursday. But energy firms say the summer deals were perfectly legal because the PUC had not yet taken action and made a series of draft decisions that put off the effective date of the direct access ban until as late as yesterday. 
"The drafts were not consistent," said Tracy Fairchild, a spokeswoman for Alliance for Retail Energy Markets, a consortium of generators and energy suppliers. "Which one were we supposed to take seriously?" 
The energy trade group is threatening to sue to protect the summer contracts. Angelides fears that a prolonged court fight could block a $12.5 billion state bond sale to reimburse the treasury for California's emergency power purchases. 
The burgeoning conflict is part of a continuing fight by energy firms and some of their business customers to preserve direct access - - a core provision of the state's 1996 deregulation law. 
Deregulation supporters predicted energy consumers would enjoy lower prices if private generators were allowed to compete with the utilities as power suppliers. But the direct access program was thrown into disarray last year when wholesale electricity prices skyrocketed and the state stepped in to buy power. 
To make sure the state's outlay would be paid back by all ratepayers, the Legislature in January directed the PUC to suspend direct access. By that time, most direct access customers were fleeing back to the utilities to benefit from a rate cap that protected them from the soaring market power prices. 
The PUC postponed action on the direct access ban while some legislators were sponsoring bills that would have allowed the program to continue under certain conditions. 
But by July, market prices had come down, and energy providers like Enron Energy Services, AES New Energy and Strategic Energy were again offering direct access contracts. 
Businesses were looking for relief from the record rate hikes imposed on utility customers in June, said Phoenix energy consultant Gina Coleman. Coleman said she helped five retail chains with "a significant number" of stores in California negotiate contracts with Strategic Energy this summer. 
"Business is business, and if you can get a better price for something, you should," said Coleman, who declined to name her clients. She said the lower costs will help the stores keep doing business in California and hold their prices down. 
Daniel Douglass, an attorney for the Alliance for Retail Energy Markets, said any attempt by the state to cancel contracts retroactively would violate the constitutional law. He said energy firms have purchased power to serve their customers under the contracts and would suffer losses if they were canceled. 
Angelides said the same firms that ran to the state for protection when their market contracts became too expensive now want to take advantage of lower power prices he attributes to the stabilizing effect of the state's long-term power contracts. 
"You can't take advantage of the state's stabilizing the rates, then say, 'Thank you very much,' and stick everyone else with the bill," Angelides said. 
State officials have not tallied the total number of customers who signed up in July and August, nor have they estimated the revenue loss that would have to be covered by remaining utility ratepayers. 
Figures compiled by the PUC show that commercial and industrial firms signed more than 6,000 new direct access contracts in July alone. A rough calculation suggests that, as a result, the firms might contribute as much as $64 million less annually to the repayment of state costs. 
The loss might not be significant enough to risk a court fight that would delay the bond sale, state officials said. 
Bu Angelides said the same power firms that helped create the energy crisis by charging exorbitant rates are now threatening a bond issue desperately needed to restore funds needed for education, health care and children's services. 
"What they're talking about doing," he said, "is holding us hostage until they get what they want."

India: Let Enron cut equity value by 75 per cent: Panel
Mahesh Vijapurkar

09/01/2001

Fin. Times Info Ltd-Asia Africa Intel Wire. The Hindu Copyright (C) 2001 Kasturi & Sons Ltd. All Rights Res'd

MUMBAI, AUG. 31. Setting the target of Rs. 2.40 per KwHr as the tariff for power from Enron-sponsored Dabhol Power Company, the Madhav Godbole Renegotiation Committee has suggested that the value of the equity which Enron now wants to sell to exit from the project be pared down by 75 per cent. If Enron agrees to this cut, the committee argues in its interim report on the renegotiation today, that the project will become viable in the context of the lower required tariff of power. 
Once the project is re-engineered on this line, the panel contends, then three-fourths of the equity should be picked up by the NTPC or any other buyers and the other quarter assigned to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB). At that time, the MSEB's stake in the project would come down from the present 30 per cent to 25 per cent but to buy this, the Government of India would need to provision an interest-free long-term loan of Rs. 2,500 crores. Mr. Godbole's report was handed over today to the Chief Minister, Mr. Vilasrao Deshmukh.
Independent of this suggestion, it is learnt that the MSEB has been willing to have its current 30 per stake, which at face value is around Rs. 850 crores, confiscated by the Indian financial institutions which have exposures to the project to the extent of Rs. 5,500 crores plus guarantees to the lendings of foreign entities but the FIs, more keen on having a completed project to hawk to buyers, has not shown any interest in this offer. The IDBI-led domestic FIs have been asked to find a way out by the Centre. 
The panel told the Maharashtra Government that the bid at re-working the deal with the DPC failed mainly because the Enron/DPC was willing to go down in the tariff only by 56 paise per unit on its current price which was abnormally high and unaffordable. This cut was valid only if the off-take was at 90 per cent of the total capacity of both phases while the MSEB can cope with only 30 per cent. 
The panel's other suggestion is that the Gas Authority of India be asked to buy the $ 800 million LNG regasification unit - Enron is willing to hive it off, sources say - again to cut the impact of the capital costs on the price of the power sold by the DPC. Anxious Indian FIs have shown willingness to what sources describe as "substantial cut in the interest rates" from the current 16.5 per cent per annum charged on the lendings to the DPC. The DPC itself has not been on record willing to accept such a possibility. 
Today's report by the Godbole panel is more or less an extension of part one of the earlier report which had set the road map on renegotiations which it was itself asked to pursue by the Maharashtra Government. The earlier report has been described by Enron as "a non-starter" but the panel has relentlessly pushed its point of view. This report, if nothing else, is a kind of document which would continue to be a basis for any future negotiations between any entities.

Davis signs bonds-sale bill, blasts GOP 
By Emily Bazar
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published May 11, 2001) 
Accusing Republicans of "playing with fire" and jeopardizing the economy, 
Gov. Gray Davis on Thursday signed a bill allowing the state to sell a 
record-setting $13.4 billion revenue bond package to finance its past and 
future electricity purchases. 
The Democratic governor's harsh words capped a tense partisan standoff in the 
Legislature that forced a delay in the bond sale until August. 
Davis warned that the delay, which he blamed on GOP lawmakers, could hurt 
Californians if state programs are cut to pay for electricity until the bonds 
are sold. 
"They should know that their constituents may well be hurt if, as a result of 
their actions, cuts have to be made in law enforcement, transportation, 
health care, education and programs for seniors," Davis said. "If I have to 
go into every district occupied by a member who voted against (the bill) and 
make a case about why this measure is necessary, that is what I will do." 
Davis commended the only Republican to vote for the measure, Assemblyman 
Anthony Pescetti of Rancho Cordova, calling his a "courageous vote in the 
face of blind opposition." 
Since mid-January, the state has committed $6.7 billion from its budget to 
last-minute electricity purchases. 
In order to pay that back, and to pay for power the state has lined up 
through long-term contracts, Davis asked the Legislature to approve a bill 
authorizing the sale of $13.4 billion in bonds. The bonds will be repaid with 
higher customer rates over the next 15 years. 
Assembly Republicans balked, saying the ratepayers would be saddled with debt 
for too long. They proposed an $8 billion bond package instead, and suggested 
using a one-time allocation from the state budget to make up the difference. 
But Monday, Assembly Democrats pressed forward with the $13.4 billion figure. 
Because they could not muster enough Republicans for a two-thirds vote, they 
passed the measure, SB 31x, with a simple majority, requiring a 90-day wait 
for the bill to become law. 
Assembly Republican leader Dave Cox of Fair Oaks said Democrats could have 
won Republican support if they had seriously considered the GOP proposal and 
actually negotiated. 
He accused Davis of engaging in "fear politics." 
"We didn't hear from the governor. It kind of leaves you with the impression 
that maybe there was never any intention of negotiating," Cox said. "It was 
either their way or forget it." 
The state's blueprint calls for the $13.4 billion to last until Jan. 1, 2003, 
by which time wholesale electricity prices are expected to have fallen, new 
power plants added and debt-ridden private utilities stabilized. 
But the plan rests on numerous assumptions beyond the state's control, 
including the price of electricity, extent of conservation, quantity of power 
available from the Pacific Northwest and production by alternative energy 
suppliers. 
Under a worst-case scenario, critics say, the state could spend the bond 
funds within several months and be left holding the bag for $50 million or 
more per day in electricity bills. 
Also Thursday, the Senate sent Davis emergency legislation that expedites 
power plant construction in California, two weeks after a controversial labor 
amendment hung up the bill, SB 28x. 
Lawmakers removed the amendment after Davis enacted its provisions in an 
executive order Tuesday. He is expected to sign the bill early next week.

Senators push administration for more help on energy crisis 
By James Rosen
Bee Washington Bureau
(Published May 11, 2001) 
WASHINGTON -- Western senators from both parties criticized Energy Secretary 
Spencer Abraham on Thursday, telling him that President Bush must respond 
with more urgency to rising gasoline prices and power shortages. 
At a Senate Energy Committee hearing, Abraham also faced tough questions over 
his department's proposed $19.2 billion budget and plans to slash funding for 
the development of alternative energy and more energy-efficient vehicles. 
"We have a pretty good plan for the long range, but we've got some problems 
right now, and we're going to hear more and more about it -- whether it's 
gasoline, whether it's electricity, whether it's the prices," said Sen. Craig 
Thomas, a Wyoming Republican. "How are you going to react to this summer's 
prices? And I'm not for price controls, but we need to have some reaction to 
what's happening now." 
Republican Sen. Gordon Smith of Oregon urged Abraham to push the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission to control wholesale energy prices. 
"We've never had a free market in energy, and people are truly going to want 
to see this administration appearing more engaged than it appears to be," 
Smith said. "We have a crisis here, and I think it would behoove the 
president -- it would behoove all of us -- to figure out a way to relieve 
this in a very aggressive way." 
Abraham told the senators that a comprehensive energy plan, which a task 
force headed by Vice President Dick Cheney is expected to release next week, 
will provide short-term and long-term solutions to the country's 
energy-supply problems. 
After the hearing, Abraham vehemently denied that either he or Bush has been 
complacent about the crisis. 
"I take a little bit of umbrage, whether it's from Republicans or Democrats, 
at the suggestion ... that we're not moving with sufficient urgency," Abraham 
said. "We've moved as fast as we can in the short period of time we've been 
in office." 
Abraham said the Bush administration has been especially responsive to the 
problems in California. 
"From the very first day that I was secretary, I was on the phone with 
(California Gov.) Gray Davis, finding out what challenges he had and how we 
could help," Abraham said. "Within three days of taking office, we supported 
his call for emergency orders to provide natural gas and electricity to 
California. 
"We have subsequently responded favorably to virtually every request he has 
made, from expediting permits that relate to new generation to helping with 
respect to his desire to move forward with the acquisition of the 
transmission system to last week's conservation measures. The only thing we 
haven't done is agree to what we consider an unwise decision to impose price 
caps. And that, I think, would only make the conditions more severe." 
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat, said the federal government 
should probe widespread signs that power suppliers have created artificial 
shortages in the state.

Energy Digest: Company will expand plant, sell power to state 


(Published May 11, 2001) 
A Huntington Beach power plant will be required to sell its increased output 
in California in exchange for speeded-up approval of an expansion project, 
the state Energy Commission agreed Thursday in a 4-0 vote. 
The decision comes after some commission lawyers and Gov. Gray Davis' office 
initially had said they were concerned that such a requirement might violate 
the U.S. Constitution. 
But the plant's owner, AES Huntington Beach, eventually agreed to the 
California-sales provision for the electricity it will produce by reviving 
two mothballed steam turbines, commission Administrative Judge Garret Shean 
said. 
The commission granted the project licensing approval Thursday, and AES will 
contract with the state for 450 megawatts, the expansion project's full 
output, according to Davis' office. The expansion should be completed by late 
summer. 
--Carrie Peyton 
Panel rejects price controls
WASHINGTON -- California Republicans led a successful effort Thursday to 
defeat an amendment that would have imposed price controls on wholesale power 
rates in an effort to lower the state's $1.5 billion monthly tab for 
electricity purchases. 
Thursday's vote was the first test in a drive by Western lawmakers to put the 
brakes on skyrocketing power rates which, in California, have zoomed tenfold 
over past year. 
By a 20-12 vote, the House Energy and Commerce Committee's energy and air 
quality subcommittee rejected a price controls amendment to an emergency 
electricity package offered by Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Los Angeles. 
"What the Republican-dominated committee has said is, 'California, drop 
dead,' " Waxman said after the vote. 
Patterned after legislation introduced in the Senate by Dianne Feinstein, 
D-Calif., and Gordon Smith, R-Ore., the Waxman amendment would require 
wholesale rates to be pegged at the price of production, plus a profit 
margin. 
--David Whitney 
Small generators' claims aired
SAN FRANCISCO -- U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali on Thursday wrestled 
with but did not come close to solving the problems of 300 small energy 
generators, including many who claim they're on the verge of collapse because 
Pacific Gas and Electric Co. has not paid them a total of about $1 billion. 
They supply about 15 percent of PG&E's electricity, according to the 
utility's figures. James Lopes, PG&E's bankruptcy lawyer, said all but eight 
of the facilities now are operating. 
But so far, more than two dozen producers of solar and wind power, biomass 
and cogeneration have asked the judge to order PG&E to pay them or release 
them from their contracts. Voiding the contracts would drive up the prices 
they could charge but might keep them from going off line before summer, when 
they're most needed. 
Montali set a May 24 hearing to assess the immediate harm facing four 
cogeneration companies whose combined motion for relief came up first in the 
PG&E Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. 
He was unsympathetic during Thursday's hearing to arguments that PG&E, even 
when it pays at the contracted rate, doesn't pay enough to keep the small 
generators in business. But he gave no indication of his ultimate ruling.

Spreading the pain 


(Published May 11, 2001) 

Monday the California Public Utilities Commission faces a $4.8 billion 
question: How should regulators divvy up the electricity rate increase they 
approved in March between residential customers and businesses? 
All customer classes of the private utilities must bear some of the burden of 
the higher costs for the electricity the state is now purchasing for Pacific 
Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison (this rate increase does not 
pertain to municipal power agencies such as SMUD). 
The right way to do that is to spread the higher electricity costs between 
residences and businesses in proportion to their use of power. This principle 
will result in a higher average percentage increase for manufacturers and 
commercial businesses because they now have lower per-kilowatt rates than 
residences, but a rate structure that reflects their power usage. 
But businesses shouldn't get saddled with some of the burden that belongs to 
residential customers, as two of the plans before the PUC propose. 
A new law prohibits the PUC from increasing the rates on residential 
electricity consumption below 130 percent of "baseline." Depending on whether 
one believes the PUC or PG&E, the law exempts anywhere from one-third to 
one-half of residential customers from any rate hikes. 
Had they not been exempted, however, their proportional share of the 
necessary rate increase would have been $1.1 billion. The Legislature 
exempted these customers as a way to protect lower-income consumers as well 
as those who conserve. Lawmakers didn't say, however, who should pay for this 
$1.1 billion in their place. 
This thankless task now falls to the PUC. Two proposals -- one by PUC 
President Loretta Lynch, another by an administrative law judge -- answer the 
$1.1 billion question in the wrong way. Both proposals seek to shift most of 
this $1.1 billion burden from the residential class onto manufacturers and 
businesses. 
That's both unfair and bad for the economy. This burden belongs solely to the 
residential class. Because the PUC cannot impose it on usage below 130 
percent of baseline, regulators must impose it on the other residential 
customers who are using the most electricity. 
Yes, this would increase their rates even more steeply than Lynch is already 
proposing. But it sends the right signal to large users of electricity to 
turn down the air conditioner and turn off unneeded appliances and lighting. 
The alternative is to subsidize their excesses through higher bills on 
businesses, as Lynch and the judge are proposing. Many manufacturers in 
California will struggle to stay afloat as they cope with their own fair 
share of the costs. Making them take part of the residential share of the 
rate increase will deepen their distress and hurt the state's economy. It 
does residential ratepayers no good to have protection for their electricity 
bills if the protection costs them their jobs. 



Oceanside seeks ally in building power plant 



By Lola Sherman 
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER 
May 10, 2001 
OCEANSIDE -- The City Council wants to generate electricity any way it can, 
including possibly building a power plant jointly with Camp Pendleton. 
It also may partner with a nearby city or the county. 
And it hopes at least to get some power from its green waste and its sewage 
plant. 
A council majority informally decided last night to pursue a joint project 
with Camp Pendleton even after an energy consultant advised against trying to 
work with the military. 
Al Figueroa of San Diego, the consultant, said the Marines' needs always will 
come before the city's. 
"For a large system and long-term commitments, the Pentagon will be 
involved," he said. "The U.S. government will not give an inch but will take 
a mile. If you want full rein over your own destiny, look elsewhere." 
Former Councilman Sam Williamson, the only person to speak from the audience 
on the issue, said it isn't true that the military won't cooperate. He cited 
its help in creating Oceanside Harbor and in moving the massive Sterling 
Homes Marine housing project out of the city. 
Williamson also suggested working with neighboring cities to find a site for 
a plant. "We do not want to depend on these gas companies any more," he said. 
Councilman Jack Feller agreed with Figueroa about avoiding the military. "I 
just cannot get behind Camp Pendleton. I think we're spinning our wheels," he 
said. 
Councilwoman Esther Sanchez said Oceanside is uniquely situated next to the 
base. "We would let our residents down if we did not at least take a look at 
it," Sanchez said. "Some people might think it's pie in the sky, but it 
actually might work." 
Except for Feller, the council members agreed it's worth a try to approach 
Camp Pendleton. 
Deputy City Manager/Fire Chief Dale Geldert was given that task. 
Councilwoman Betty Harding said the city isn't looking for its own power 
plant simply to ease municipal electricity costs, which are running $800,000 
a year over budget, but to do something to help reduce residents' soaring 
power bills. 
Councilwoman Carol McCauley said: "Maybe there's a silver lining behind this 
cloud. Maybe we can become self-sufficient, whether at Camp Pendleton or with 
other cities." 
"Explore every avenue, every direction," McCauley urged Geldert.






Davis signs bill authorizing $13.4 in bonds to repay treasury for power 
buying 



By Don Thompson
ASSOCIATED PRESS 
May 10, 2001 
SACRAMENTO ) Gov. Gray Davis signed a law Thursday letting the state borrow 
$13.4 billion to pay for electricity for three cash-starved utilities. 
Davis couldn't guarantee the 15-year bond will be enough to cover the state's 
electricity purchases. But he said the $13.4 billion price tag represents 
"the best thinking of our financial analysts," and includes a reserve in case 
electricity prices remain higher than expected. 
The state spent $1,900 per megawatt hour Wednesday as state grid operators 
narrowly avoided a third consecutive day of blackouts, Davis said, 
reiterating his call for federal price caps. Cooler weather helped the state 
avoid blackouts Thursday. 
Wednesday's costs were a record or near-record since the state purchases 
began in January, said Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the power-buying 
Department of Water Resources. 
Davis said he hopes the state can stop buying power for Pacific Gas and 
Electric, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric by the 
end of next year. 
Davis accused Assembly Republicans of putting their political opposition 
above the state's welfare by refusing to support the bond bill. That means 
the bonds can't be issued for three months, which Davis said will drive up 
the interest ratepayers will be charged for the bond. 
"This measure is a lifeboat that allows us to stay afloat," he said. 
In a statement, Assembly GOP Leader Dave Cox called the bond bill "a 
dangerous gamble for California ) a gamble Republicans couldn't support 
without a clear endgame ... The governor obviously believes that history will 
judge that his was the right decision. He had better be right." 
Also Thursday, a federal bankruptcy judge considered ordering PG&E to make 
millions of dollars in back payments to small power plant owners that provide 
nearly a third of California's electricity. 
And California power regulators continued struggling over how to divide 
record electric rate increases among the 9 million customers of the state's 
two largest utilities, Edison and PG&E. The Public Utilities Commission is 
rushing to adopt the higher rates Monday. 





GOP defeats first attempt to cap power prices 



By Toby Eckert
COPLEY NEWS SERVICE 
May 10, 2001 
WASHINGTON ) Republican lawmakers on Thursday slapped down an effort to 
impose price controls on wholesale power sold in California and 10 other 
Western states. 
In the first test of congressional resolve on the issue, Republicans on the 
House energy and air quality subcommittee, including three from California, 
voted unanimously against the temporary price limits, while most Democrats on 
the panel backed the move. The issue will now come before the full House 
Energy and Commerce Committee. 
The subcommittee vote dramatized the deep partisan divisions that have 
developed, even within California's congressional delegation, over how the 
federal government should respond to the crisis. While Democrats argue that 
price controls would bring stability to the state's chaotic power market, 
most Republicans ) including President Bush ) counter that they would 
aggravate electricity shortages by discouraging needed power generation and 
sales. 
After two days of rolling blackouts in California, a preview of what could be 
in store for the state all summer, the subcommittee vote was being watched 
closely for any signs of wavering on the issue by Republicans worried about 
the political fallout. 
California Democrats vowed to continue pushing the measure and predicted 
their Republican colleagues would pay a price for opposing it. 
"Republican ratepayers are going to have to pay the same exorbitant prices as 
Democratic ratepayers," said Rep. Jane Harman, D-Redondo Beach, a member of 
the full committee. "As ... the blackouts increase over the next two months, 
those folks who voted 'No' in this subcommittee are going to face very tough 
questions. I wouldn't be surprised if they try a bit later to get on board." 
But Rep. George Radonovich, R-Mariposa, said he was feeling little pressure 
from his constituents to support price controls. 
"All they care about is politics," he said of the Democrats who criticized 
his vote against the controls. "What we're concerned about are some real 
solutions to the problems, which they don't offer." 
Republican Reps. Christopher Cox of Newport Beach and Mary Bono of Palm 
Springs also voted against the measure. 
Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Los Angeles, offered it as an amendment to a 
Republican-crafted bill that contains several measures aimed at boosting 
electricity production and encouraging energy conservation in the West. The 
amendment would require federal regulators to impose either "just and 
reasonable" rates for wholesale power that fluctuate with demand or rates 
tied to the cost of producing the power, plus a "reasonable" profit. 
Electricity generated at new power plants would be exempt from the limits to 
encourage their construction. 
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., is pushing a similar measure in the Senate, 
so far without success. 
Wholesale electricity prices in California have soared in the past year, a 
side-effect of deregulation of the state's power market and increased prices 
for natural gas, which fuels most of the power plants. Utilities have been 
unable to pass on the full cost of the power to customers, threatening their 
financial stability and driving one, Pacific Gas & Electric, into bankruptcy. 
Waxman argued that price controls would discourage power sellers from 
withholding power from the market to drive up prices. 
"The only way that we'll get some relief in California is to put some limit 
on the gouging that has taken place," he said. "...The rest of this bill does 
not do much of anything for the state of California and the West during this 
crisis." 
But Republicans said price controls would have the exact opposite effect: 
discouraging power providers from generating and selling electricity in the 
region. 
"It simply is a guarantee for more blackouts," said Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., 
the chairman of the full committee. 
The amendment was defeated 20-12. Two Democrats ) Reps. Ralph Hall of Texas 
and Christopher John of Louisiana ) voted against the measure. 
The underlying bill passed on a party-line vote of 17-13. 
It would allow the California governor to temporarily waive some 
air-pollution limits to increase power production in the state when blackouts 
are imminent; provide federal funding to fix a major power transmission 
bottleneck in the Central Valley; require federal facilities in power-starved 
states to cut their energy use by 20 percent; allow California, Nevada, 
Oregon and Washington to adjust daylight savings time; and allow small, 
independent power generators to escape exclusive contracts with utilities if, 
in the future, they are not paid by the utilities. 
While Democrats complained the bill would do little to provide immediate 
relief to California and other Western states, subcommittee Chairman Joe 
Barton, R-Tex., said, "it's the only game in town that will help." 
"We can reduce the number of blackouts, we can minimize the time of the 
blackouts if we pass this measure...," he said. 





Energy task force expected to recommend tax breaks 



By H. Josef Hebert
ASSOCIATED PRESS 
May 10, 2001 
WASHINGTON ) The Bush administration's energy task force will urge relaxing 
clean air requirements to help refiners meet gasoline demand, and call for 
tax breaks for some renewable energy such as wind and solar panels, according 
to government sources. 
The refinery proposal is aimed at addressing a petroleum industry complaint 
that federal and local air quality rules often require production of slightly 
different blends of gasoline, putting added strain on the supply and 
distribution systems. 
The so-called boutique blends of gasoline have been the subject of vigorous 
complaints from refiners, who argue that they are not needed to meet federal 
air quality goals, but prevent shifting of gasoline supplies where they are 
most needed. 
It was not clear Thursday whether the proposal would assume a waiver in some 
cases of reformulated gasoline, which accounts for about a third of the 
gasoline sold nationwide. This cleaner gasoline contains an oxygen additive 
and is required in areas with serious pollution problems. 
The energy task force is headed by Vice President Dick Cheney. 
Separately, the House took its first action Thursday to try to ease 
California's power problems this summer, but in a subcommittee vote rejected 
Democratic demands for price controls on Western wholesale electricity. 
The bill, approved by an Energy and Commerce subcommittee by a 17-13 
party-line vote, "will not stop blackouts," said Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, 
its chief sponsor, but give California some additional tools to boost 
supplies this summer. 
In a letter to Barton, California Gov. Gray Davis said the measure "will do 
little to address our current situation." He urged approval of price caps on 
soaring wholesale electricity prices. Caps were rejected by a 20-12 vote with 
solid GOP opposition including the three California Republicans on the 
subcommittee. 
The Cheney task force, which will present its report to President Bush next 
week, also will propose regulatory relief for construction of nuclear power 
plants and tax incentives for development of technologies that make coal less 
polluting. 
Both nuclear and coal, which together account for nearly three-fourths of the 
electricity produced, are essential to meet future energy needs, the task 
force will declare. While urging expanded development of natural gas, the 
report will warn against relying too heavily on a single energy source 
including natural gas. 
While the energy blueprint will focus heavily on long-range plans to boost 
energy supplies, the administration in recent weeks has scurried to include 
additional conservation and energy efficiency measures. 
Fearing a backlash from environmentalists, Republicans and Democrats in 
Congress have urged the administration to not ignore efficiency and renewable 
energy sources. 
"We need a balanced approach. We need renewables and conservation," said Sen. 
Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources 
Committee, who also is an advocate for the measures to expand supplies 
including drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. 
The task force will urge Congress to approve drilling in the refuge. 
The task force's efficiency and renewable proposals will focus heavily on 
providing tax incentives including tax breaks for the development and 
purchase of more fuel efficient "hybrid" gas-electric automobiles, 
residential solar panels, wind generation, and development of hydrogen fuel 
cells, according to sources who spoke on condition on anonymity. 
In other energy-related developments Thursday: 
)Senate Democrats complained that they have been "left in the dark" about the 
administration's energy plans and should have been consulted by the Cheney 
task force. 
)Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., said he will soon introduce legislation to create 
a special House-Senate committee to investigate soaring energy prices. He 
said there are all the indications of price manipulation and a committee 
"would keep the spotlight" on the electricity and gasoline markets. 
)Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., called for creation of a national consumer energy 
commission that would give a voice to consumers in the debate over energy 
shortages and rising prices.

Power Rescue Plan Rests on Many 'Ifs' 


By NANCY VOGEL, RICH CONNELL and ROBERT J. LOPEZ, Times Staff Writers 

?????The success of Gov. Gray Davis' plan to end California's energy crisis 
rides on assumptions that, if wrong, could lead to billions of dollars in 
runaway costs for taxpayers.
?????Davis, who signed a historic $13.4-billion bond measure Thursday to 
finance the plan, has refused to release key data and presented a single 
model for how California will buy electricity--and pay for it--over the next 
15 years.
?????If Davis and his cadre of financial advisors are right, the state will 
emerge from the most ominous period of the crisis in less than two years, 
flush with cash and the prospect of electricity rate cuts. By then, the hope 
goes, the power suppliers Davis has vilified will be reined in.
?????If his predictions are off by modest margins, which even many state 
officials and energy experts say is likely, the state may have to employ 
tactical blackouts to control costs, siphon money that could be used for 
other services, go deeper in debt or raise electricity rates above the record 
increases of this year.
?????The governor's plan largely rests on these crucial assumptions: that 
consumers will conserve a record amount of power at peak usage times, that 
energy prices will drop precipitously, and that the state will lock in far 
more contracts for long-term power. But those three assumptions could prove 
faulty, according to government financial records and interviews with state 
officials, Wall Street analysts and energy experts.
?????Davis is banking on that troika to quickly tame the wild prices of 
last-minute power--which hit an apparent record of $2,000 for a megawatt-hour 
Wednesday. Such purchases so far have put the state on the hook for $6 
billion and pushed major utilities to the brink of ruin.
?????Davis' plan assumes that the state will reduce peak demand by 2,484 
megawatts--enough to supply nearly 2 million homes--through three programs 
run by the California Independent System Operator, which keeps power running 
to homes and businesses across the state.
?????But Cal-ISO managers say they will be lucky to achieve a fraction of 
that savings this summer.
?????They say that one of the programs listed in the governor's plan was 
shelved because regulators had raised concerns about air pollution. Another, 
aimed at businesses, is likely to yield only about half of the 600 megawatts 
the governor has assumed will be saved when supplies are tight this summer, 
said Cal-ISO Project Manager Bill Wagner.
?????"There's a lot of 'ifs' in there," he said of the conservation program, 
which would pay businesses to cut back during critical hours. He said the 
utilities are months behind in installing meters to measure the savings.
?????Officials at another state agency in charge of a similar conservation 
program, the Public Utilities Commission, also said they are not sure about 
hitting targets on which the bond plan is based.
?????PUC Senior Analyst Robert Strauss said he has no idea how many 
businesses will agree to curtail electricity consumption in exchange for 
cheaper power rates this summer. The program is only a month old, he said.
?????"We're in a new situation that we don't have good experience with," 
Strauss said. "Who's going to sign up for these programs? We don't really 
know." Another program that Davis hopes will conserve 1,600 megawatts has 
attracted interest from just two businesses since March.
?????"It's pretty ambitious to think we're going to get 1,600 megawatts by 
June in that program," said Cal-ISO's Wagner.
?????Beyond Davis' assumptions about conservation, the success of his 
hard-fought bond measure relies heavily on how much the state will pay for 
electricity during the next two summers. If the price is higher than forecast 
by Davis, the bond money could be consumed more quickly, potentially forcing 
the state to borrow more, dip into tax funds or raise customer rates again.
?????To keep prices down, the Davis administration has struggled to lock up 
in contracts most of the peak-hour power needed for the next two summers to 
avoid premium, eleventh-hour prices.
?????In his effort to push his bond legislation through the Capitol, he has 
suggested that about 50 such contracts will be signed to produce half of the 
peak demand the state needs. And that, his advisors say, doesn't count other 
contracts they think will materialize. 
?????So far, the administration has fallen far short, achieving final 
agreements on only 28 contracts as of Thursday.
?????If that gap persists, the state will probably be forced to buy 
electricity on the expensive spot market, which could eat into the bond money.
?????"I think the operative word is uncertainty," said Paul Patterson, an 
energy analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston. "There are too many pieces, 
[and] all you need is for one or two of those not to work out substantially 
and things change."
?????Patterson, who says he remains cautiously optimistic about the 
governor's plan, was among a group of Wall Street analysts who were briefed 
last week by Davis' top advisors.
?????Some wondered about who would provide the additional power that Davis 
had incorporated into his plan. Others questioned whether investors would buy 
the bonds with so many assumptions built into the measure.
?????During the briefing, the governor's advisors said one option being 
considered is to refuse to pay the highest prices for power and "accept some 
sort of rolling blackout scenario."
?????One of the governor's chief energy consultants, Joseph Fichera, told the 
Wall Street analysts that if suppliers think they can profit by holding back 
power until the threshold of blackouts, the state may simply say no, leaving 
them with no sale.
?????Through calculations that include contracts and conservation, Davis' 
advisors arrived at another assumption that has drawn skepticism. They insist 
that the purchase of any power not under contract will average just $195 per 
megawatt-hour this summer--helping slash overall power costs by hundreds of 
millions. 
?????Critics say the California market is simply too volatile to forecast. 
Before Tuesday's blackouts, for example, prices on the last-minute market had 
been below $800 for a megawatt-hour, a considerable amount. But not as much 
as it was Wednesday when the state paid Houston-based Reliant Energy $2,000, 
Davis said Thursday. 
?????A report by Republican Assembly members concluded that if Davis' 
assumption that non-contracted power will average $195 is off by just 10%, 
electricity would cost an additional $250 million by September. Over two 
years, those additional costs could soar to $1.1 billion, the GOP study found.
?????Democratic state Controller Kathleen Connell, whose staff has attempted 
to analyze the governor's report, is warning that rising power costs could 
tear through the bond funds and possibly expose the state's general fund.
?????Connell accused the governor of tailoring his assumptions and numbers to 
neatly fit his goal of assuring the public--and Wall Street--that an end to 
the crisis is near.
?????Fichera, who helped prepare the report, insists that the 
administration's bond plan is conservative and presents the most reasonable 
scenario of the converging forces of conservation and prices.
?????Even if things do not fall into place, Fichera said, there is an extra 
$1 billion packaged into the measure, along with an expectation of billions 
more in later years to cover any shortfalls.
?????"Any realistic scenario," Fichera said, "we believe we have the 
resources to cover."
?????Fichera said he sees only a slim possibility that power costs in the 
next two years could outpace the available bond money, forcing the state to 
borrow more. He said such a loan could easily be paid back by the recent 
utility rate increases, which would cover both dropping costs of power and 
the bonds within the next three years.
?????Fichera declined to provide The Times with figures showing at what point 
higher power costs could consume the cushion he said is built into the 
governor's plan. Public officials and newspapers, including The Times, have 
sued the administration for more details about the state's power costs.
?????But Davis and his consultants say key financial information must be kept 
secret to prevent energy traders from gaining more leverage in the state's 
power market. 
?????But that confidence was tempered in a state document given to Wall 
Street analysts that recently accompanied an unrelated bond issue.
?????The document acknowledged that the assumptions underlying Davis' 
financial plan to restore stability to the California electricity market were 
"subject to many uncertainties." "There can be no assurance," the document 
concluded, "that there will not be future disruptions in energy supplies or 
related developments which could adversely affect the state's economy."

NEWS ANALYSIS
Bush, Rivals Don't Dare Ask Public to Make Sacrifices in Energy Crunch 
By RONALD BROWNSTEIN, Times Political Writer 

?????WASHINGTON--Amid their looming conflicts on energy policy, President 
Bush and his critics appear to have reached agreement on an unlikely point: 
Neither side is preparing to ask for significant sacrifices from the public 
to respond to rising prices and squeezed supplies.
?????In the energy policy blueprint it will release next week, the 
administration is expected to present enhanced production as the key to 
easing the energy crunch. Democrats and environmentalists, in response, are 
stressing measures to prod manufacturers to design more energy-efficient 
products, from cars to air conditioners.
?????But neither side is yet suggesting that ordinary Americans--whose 
average energy consumption has increased steadily over the last 15 years--may 
have to scale back lifestyles that increasingly include mammoth sport-utility 
vehicles, dawn-to-dark home computer use and new houses 50% larger than a 
generation ago.
?????In fact, as the debate over Bush's plan approaches, both sides are 
working overtime to insist that their solutions will allow Americans to use 
virtually as much energy as they want--without sacrifice.
?????In a striking declaration earlier this week, White House spokesman Ari 
Fleischer portrayed unconstrained energy use as virtually an American 
birthright. "That's a big no," he answered when asked if Bush believes 
Americans need to curtail their energy use. "The president believes that's an 
American way of life and that it should be the goal of policymakers to 
protect the American way of life."
?????More surprising, environmentalists mobilizing to fight Bush's plan are 
sending a similar message. "We don't need to sacrifice a lifestyle in order 
to save energy," says Dan Becker, director of the global warming and energy 
program for the Sierra Club.
?????This improbable consensus reflects a deeper political calculation 
shaping both sides' response to the energy challenge. After a decade in which 
American life on almost every front--from energy to jobs to federal 
revenues--has been defined by abundance, politicians have grown extremely 
reluctant to confront voters with hard choices and unpleasant alternatives.
?????The big question is whether either side's preferred solutions can 
resolve the long-term energy problem without forcing Americans to face at 
least some of those hard choices.
?????Compared to most issues, public opinion about the energy debate is 
unformed, analysts in both parties agree. That's largely because few 
Americans have thought much about the problem since the last gas lines 
disappeared 20 years ago. "People aren't settled on what are the causes of 
the problem, let alone what are some of the solutions," says pollster Mark 
Baldassare, a senior fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California.
?????As the struggle to shape public opinion begins, the central division is 
likely to exist between Bush's emphasis on new production and the 
Democratic/environmentalist push for greater reliance on renewable energy and 
conservation. But that loud dispute threatens to obscure the remarkable 
convergence on an equally important point: To the extent either side sees 
conservation as part of the solution, they portray it primarily as something 
done for consumers rather than by consumers.
?????White House aides say Bush isn't likely to completely ignore the value 
of individual conservation; the Democratic energy alternative includes a 
provision that could eventually compel the government to discourage the use 
of vehicles with poor fuel efficiency. But overall both sides are promising 
minimal disruption--a stark contrast to the admission by California officials 
that higher prices are needed to deter electricity consumption.
?????Indeed, it's telling that, instead of discussing conservation, both Bush 
and his critics are increasingly talking about energy efficiency. That 
formulation implies engineering strategies rather than lifestyle changes to 
reduce consumption. "With technology, there's no reason why . . . you've got 
to live in the dark, turn out all the lights, don't enjoy the things that our 
modern society brings you," Vice President Dick Cheney said this week.
?????Looming over these political and rhetorical calculations is the ghost of 
President Carter, whose administration was plagued by repeated energy shocks 
in the late 1970s. When Carter unveiled his comprehensive energy plan just 
months after taking office in 1977, his message hit a strikingly different 
note: The crisis, Carter said, "will demand that we make sacrifices and 
changes in every life."
?????Behind those words, Carter offered an agenda bristling with thorny ideas 
to discourage energy use: new taxes on gas-guzzling cars, automatic taxes on 
gasoline triggered when consumption rose too fast, utility reforms that 
increased costs for the heaviest users.
?????But Congress rejected almost all these ideas, focusing instead on tax 
incentives to encourage more efficient energy use, and Carter's efforts to 
encourage voluntary conservation (like turning down the heat in winter) 
became a lasting symbol of weakness and ineffectuality.
?????Today strategists on both sides agree that the public is even less 
inclined to sacrifice. And in that climate, neither Bush nor Democrats are 
focusing on a paradox central to the energy riddle: While most products have 
grown more energy efficient over the past generation, energy use per person 
in America is still rising.
?????In the immediate aftermath of the 1970s oil shocks, per capita U.S. 
energy use declined by roughly 8% from 1973 through 1985. But as the memory 
of those disruptions faded, energy use per person increased almost 10% from 
1985 through 1999, according to the federal Energy Information Administration.
?????On several fronts, it appears the demand for bigger energy-intensive 
products is offsetting the efficiency gains of improved technology. Take 
homes. In an April study, the National Assn. of Home Builders concluded that 
because of such innovations as greater use of insulated windows and more 
efficient furnaces, new homes today use energy twice as efficiently as they 
did 30 years ago. But despite those improvements, the overall trend among new 
homes is toward greater energy consumption.
?????In the first years after the 1970s oil shock, average fuel efficiency 
for all passenger vehicles in America steadily increased, peaking at 25.9 
miles per gallon in 1987. Since then average fuel efficiency has declined, 
dropping to 24 mpg in 2000, the lowest it has been since 1980, according to 
the Environmental Protection Agency.
?????Some analysts think both sides are selling the public short by exempting 
them from sacrifice in the growing energy debate. "Americans have heard 
messages about changing their ways and have been accepting when it comes to 
conservation," says Baldassare.
?????But the dominant instinct is to target other causes--and solutions--for 
the challenge, with Bush blaming environmental restrictions that have blocked 
drilling or new power plant construction and Democrats pointing fingers at 
oil companies, car manufacturers and the administration's links to both.
?????"Nobody wants to be in a position of telling the American public they 
can't have what they want," acknowledges one top Bush political advisor.

House Committee Rejects Electricity Price Controls 
Strategy: In a blow to California's governor, Congress signals it won't rein 
in soaring costs. 

By GREG MILLER and RICHARD SIMON, Times Staff Writers 

?????WASHINGTON--In the first test of congressional sentiment on California's 
power problems, a House panel on Thursday rebuffed an effort by Democratic 
lawmakers to legislate price caps on wholesale electricity.
?????The proposal, voted down 20 to 12 by the House energy and air quality 
subcommittee, would have required the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to 
impose price controls keyed to the cost of generating power.
?????The Republican-controlled panel went on to approve a bill containing a 
number of less aggressive energy crisis measures, such as allowing California 
to relax environmental restrictions on power plants and extending daylight 
saving time to reduce evening electricity consumption.
?????But the vote on price controls, which split largely along party lines, 
was the most contentious issue addressed by the subcommittee. Although price 
cap advocates are expected to press their campaign at least twice more in the 
House, Thursday's vote was a significant setback. It signaled that Congress 
is not inclined to rein in soaring energy prices, despite repeated pleas from 
Gov. Gray Davis and other state officials to do so.
?????Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), who offered the price control 
measure as an amendment to the energy bill, argued that it would protect 
consumers from price gouging while preserving "reasonable" profit margins for 
power suppliers.
?????Without price controls, he said, the bill "does not do for California 
what we need, and it does a lot of things for our state we don't want."
?????But the other three Californians on the subcommittee--all 
Republicans--disagreed, and voted against Waxman's amendment, saying they 
believe price controls would exacerbate the problem by discouraging 
investment in new sources of energy.
?????"I recognize there's tremendous political pressure on us, but do not 
believe it's the right thing to do," said Rep. Mary Bono (R-Palm Springs).
?????She was joined in voting against the measure by Reps. Christopher Cox 
(R-Newport Beach) and George P. Radanovich (R-Mariposa). The three California 
Republicans ensured the amendment's defeat, because one Democrat who voted 
against the measure, Rep. Ralph M. Hall of Texas, said he would have 
supported it if all of the California members of the subcommittee had done so.
?????In Sacramento, Davis lashed out at Bono, Cox and Radanovich for opposing 
price caps.
?????"I find it very surprising that people here in California experiencing 
this crisis can go back to Washington and vote against the best interests of 
constituents of this state," Davis said.
?????Waxman indicated he would attempt to revive the price cap amendment when 
the bill is taken up by the full House Energy and Commerce Committee.
?????A final test could come later this month, when the full House is 
expected to vote on the bill. Four California Republicans who are not on the 
energy committee have already signaled they would support a price control 
amendment.
?????Thursday's vote was the first congressional action directed at 
California's energy crisis, and underscored the extent to which the center of 
political debate on the issue is shifting from Sacramento to Washington.
?????Next week, the White House plans to unveil a comprehensive national 
energy strategy. The plan is expected to emphasize long-term solutions, 
ranging from new oil exploration in Alaska to construction of hundreds of new 
power plants and refineries.
?????With California experiencing rolling blackouts and gasoline prices 
surging nationwide, the White House has become increasingly sensitive to 
criticism that its plan won't provide much immediate help.
?????At a news conference Thursday, White House spokesman Ari Fleischer 
stressed that "the president's focus is going to be on doing everything he 
can for all terms: short-term, medium-term and long-term."
?????House Republicans attending Thursday's subcommittee session were careful 
to endorse the administration's position that the federal government's 
ability to help California in the short term is limited.
?????"We can't make it rain. We can't make it snow. We can't make it cool in 
Palm Springs," said Rep. Joe Barton (R-Texas), sponsor of the emergency bill 
and chairman of the subcommittee.
?????Still, he said, Congress can provide some assistance. Barton's bill, 
which was approved 17 to 13 by the subcommittee, contains more than a dozen 
provisions designed to curb consumption and enhance power supplies.
?????Some of the key provisions would: 
?????* Authorize California's governor to waive some emission requirements on 
natural gas-fired power plants on "emergency" days of high demand. Democrats 
said Davis hasn't sought such discretion, and the measure is unlikely to help 
because environmental regulations have not hindered power generation.
?????* Allow energy users to resell some of the electricity they are entitled 
to consume but don't. Republicans said this would create a financial 
incentive to conserve, but Democrats said they fear it would undercut 
existing state programs that reward conservation.
?????* Allow some power suppliers to suspend contracts with financially 
strapped utilities. The measure is designed to enable companies that have cut 
off supplies for lack of payment to cut new deals with other utilities or 
users.
?????* Require federal facilities in states where electricity emergencies

Nonprofit Shrugs at Pleas to Conserve 
Power: Ayn Rand Institute blasts calls to use less electricity. Utility and 
government officials defend conservation. 

By BOB POOL, Times Staff Writer 

?????Their other electricity customers may be following the Southern 
California Edison Co.'s plea to conserve electricity during the current 
energy crisis.
?????But don't expect anyone to be going room-to-room flipping off lights and 
turning down air conditioning in a fourth-floor suite at one Marina del Rey 
office building.
?????That kind of conservation is "immoral" and "un-American," say those 
working at the Ayn Rand Institute international headquarters on Admiralty Way.
?????The 15-year-old nonprofit group is run by devotees of novelist and 
philosopher Ayn Rand, who died in 1982. It is a clearinghouse and educational 
center for those who embrace Rand's theories of individualism and 
laissez-faire capitalism.
?????Her philosophy, Rand wrote, "is the concept of man as a heroic being, 
with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive 
achievement as his noblest activity."
?????Rand--whose first name rhymes with mine--is best known for the novels 
"The Fountainhead" and "Atlas Shrugged," which together have sold 20 million 
copies.
?????Institute leaders are blasting calls for electricity conservation and 
the executive order issued last week by President Bush that directs operators 
of federal buildings in California to reduce energy consumption.
?????"Expecting the American people to lower their standard of living is an 
immoral idea," said Yaron Brook, the institute's executive director.
?????"Conservation is not a long- or short-term solution to the energy 
crisis. Conservation is the un-American idea of resigning oneself to doing 
with less--like a sick person who stops seeking a cure and resigns himself to 
living with his illness." Instead, he said, market forces should prevail to 
increase power supplies and reduce demand.
?????On Thursday, Brook's statements surprised officials pleading with 
Californians to turn off lights and reduce air conditioning to help prevent 
rolling blackouts.
?????" 'Un-American?' I've never heard that before," said Tom Boyd, an Edison 
spokesman. "We and other utilities are urging our customers to conserve 
electricity and use it wisely."
?????Lori O'Donley, a spokeswoman for the California Independent System 
Operator, the agency that monitors power consumption and orders rolling 
blackouts when supplies run low, said that "there are times we feel 
conservation has made a difference" in calling or not calling for blackouts.
?????A White House spokeswoman said President Bush stands by his call for 
conservation.
?????"The president believes the federal government should do its part. He 
takes the energy crisis in California very seriously and believes it is right 
and appropriate to explore how we can conserve energy," Claire Buchan said.
?????Brook disagrees.
?????The 40-year-old former Santa Clara University finance professor has 
headed the institute since last August. It has 16 staffers and operates on a 
$3-million annual budget financed by about 4,000 contributors--all firm 
believers in Ayn Rand's philosophy.
?????Brook said he was a teenager living in Israel when he read "Atlas 
Shrugged" and was immediately converted from the concept of socialism to 
capitalism.
?????By coincidence, that novel features a countrywide blackout that is the 
result of massive government economic regulation. Rand writes on page 1,075 
of towns "reduced to the life of those ages in which artificial light was an 
exorbitant luxury and a sunset put an end to human activity."
?????The towns were ruined by "rations, quotas, controls and 
power-conservation rules."
?????Brook said the institute's Marina del Rey headquarters has thus far been 
spared blackouts. But at his Tustin home, he and his wife and two children 
turn off lights when they aren't needed.
?????"I do it because I don't want to pay higher electricity bills," he said 
with a laugh. "I don't want to pay for something I don't use."

Restarting of Generators in O.C. Approved 


By JENIFER WARREN, Times Staff Writer 

?????SACRAMENTO--Granting the governor's wish that power plants receive 
speedy approval, the California Energy Commission cleared the way Thursday 
for the restarting of two idled generators that will double the output of a 
plant in Huntington Beach.
?????The commission's action allows AES Corp. to run the two controversial 
units for at least 10 years, provided that a midterm review finds that 
operators are taking steps to limit any harm the plant may cause to seawater 
quality and marine life.
?????The commission also required the company to sell all the power generated 
by the units, enough to supply about 337,500 homes, within California--a 
restriction unprecedented in the state.
?????Some attorneys questioned whether the panel had the legal authority to 
impose such a restriction. But Commissioner Robert Laurie said that although 
the limit "may not be good long-term policy," the state's power emergency 
warrants it now.
?????The commission's unanimous vote capped weeks of arduous negotiations 
involving AES, the state and Huntington Beach officials, who called the 
10-year permit "a major disappointment." AES officials pushed for the 10 
years on grounds that a shorter time frame would make the economics of the 
project iffy.
?????City officials preferred a five-year permit, saying the company's track 
record--it once paid a $17-million fine for allowing too much pollution to 
spew from its Long Beach plant--raises doubts about its future performance. 
The commission's staff also favored five years, with the possibility of a 
five-year extension.
?????"They have not exactly been great corporate citizens," Matt Lamb, 
project manager for Huntington Beach, said of AES. "This is a grossly 
inefficient plant that has been mothballed, and they're basically 
kick-starting it. We don't think it deserves 10 years."
?????But Gov. Gray Davis--who has publicly pushed the commission to approve 
plants quickly--hailed the decision. "That's good news. That's supply we're 
counting on," he said.
?????The two Huntington Beach units are 40 years old and have been idle since 
1995. But the energy crisis has made the old valuable once again, and AES 
plans to invest $150 million to re-power the generators--once scheduled for 
demolition.
?????The units represent almost 10% of the 5,000 megawatts Davis has said he 
will bring into service this summer to avert an electricity shortage.
?????Recent estimates, however, suggest that the governor's pledge was overly 
optimistic.
?????And although Davis and the Energy Commission are expecting the 
Huntington Beach generators to begin operating in August, AES Southland 
President Mark Woodruff said Thursday that it is unclear whether that goal 
can be met.
?????The AES project is among a few receiving fast-track approval under the 
governor's executive order earlier this year requiring expedited review of 
such plants.
?????In normal times, a 450-megawatt project such as the one approved 
Thursday might have taken a year's worth of study, public hearings and other 
scrutiny, said Claudia Chandler, a commission spokeswoman. The expedited 
review shrinks that to just 60 days.
?????That clearly rankles some Huntington Beach residents, who, in testimony 
before the commission, wondered whether emissions, ocean pollution and other 
threats had been thoroughly studied.
?????"I think it's almost outrageous what's being foisted on the public," 
said Rich Lloyd, who lives about a quarter of a mile from the plant. "What 
relief are you going to give to all these people, all these schoolchildren, 
who have to breathe these emissions for 10 years?"
?????Huntington Beach Councilwoman Shirley Dettloff said she too was troubled 
by the fast-track licensing process: "We're taking a risk as a city," she 
said. "If a price has to be paid, our citizens will be paying that price."
?????Critics are alarmed by a UC Irvine study concluding that the 
plant--which now uses and discharges about 300 million gallons of seawater 
each day as coolant--may combine with ocean currents to attract sewage 
released miles offshore. 
?????Many residents suspect that the plant contributed to pollution that 
caused repeated beach closures in 1999.
?????Acknowledging the concerns, the commission required AES to spend $1 
million to study whether water quality is at risk.
?????The company also must spend $2.5 million to monitor fish deaths caused 
by its seawater intake system. If too many white croaker, queenfish and other 
species become trapped and die, AES may be required to modernize its 
equipment, commission officials said.
?????Other complaints have focused on the noise, smoke and smells produced by 
the plant.
?????Jane Riley, who lives nearby, plans her outings with son Daniel, 6, 
around the thick clouds of yellow-brown smoke that are a part of everyday 
life.
?????"I try to avoid it. I take a look at which direction it's going," Riley 
said. With two more units fired up, a bad situation will only get worse, she 
fears.
?????In other action Thursday, the commission approved a 95-megawatt "peaker" 
plant in the Central Valley city of Hanford.
?????Peaker plants can produce large amounts of power in short bursts, and 
the governor is counting on such facilities to make up about 40% of 
California's electricity deficit this summer.

Discovery Has City Flying High 
Energy: Claim of huge natural gas deposit leads Delano to dream of wealth 
that may result. But some are skeptical. 

By GEOFFREY MOHAN, Times Staff Writer 

?????DELANO, Calif.--At the signal from oil wildcatter F. Lynn Blystone, 
roughnecks opened the valve of a greasy well rig, and with an earsplitting 
screech, a fat jet of natural gas blasted plumes of dust from the fields 
outside this San Joaquin Valley town.
?????City officials covered their ears and dropped their jaws.
?????"That's the sound of money, loud and powerful," said Delano City Manager 
Adela Gonzalez.
?????Indeed, the estimated 3 trillion cubic feet of coveted and pricey 
natural gas that Blystone, president and chief executive of Tri-Valley Corp. 
in Bakersfield, claims to have tapped could be the biggest natural gas 
discovery in California since the 1930s, and might rank among the top in the 
lower 48 states.
?????And although the full extent of the find remains unproven--and industry 
veterans urge caution--Blystone's well has set off a frenzy in this 
impoverished agricultural town more famous for Cesar Chavez and the pickers 
who touched off a national grape boycott.
?????Delano is seeing dollar signs in the dust. It's talking power plants, 
pipelines, big industry, and independence from the grip of the statewide 
energy crisis.
?????Energy consultants are lining up at City Hall, where visitors are urged 
to use the stairs instead of the elevators to save electricity. Ordinary 
residents are scurrying to learn if they own mineral rights, mostly finding 
that their dreams of overnight riches are about as real as the fictional 
Clampett family on TV's "The Beverly Hillbillies."
?????"Everybody is doing their research, to see if they have mineral rights," 
said Delano Mayor Art Armendares. "We're getting control of our own destiny. 
We can provide citizens with uninterrupted electricity and gas. Then we can 
put up our shingle and attract industry."
?????Beyond grapes, almonds and other crops, industry is sparse in Delano, 
which recently attracted a Sears distribution center for the West Coast. 
Seasonal unemployment reaches upward of 30%, Armendares said.
?????Even if Delano is poised to reap rewards, the state in general won't see 
much effect. That's because even the optimistic estimates of daily production 
wouldn't meet more than 1% of the state's whopping 7.5 billion cubic-foot 
demand, according to the state Department of Conservation.
?????That hasn't stopped Delano residents from dreaming. Among those who 
might hit it big are City Manager Gonzalez's secretary, Phyllis Kraft, who 
hails from one of the area's old farming families.
?????"People aren't exactly treating me differently, but they are saying, 
'You're not going to forget me when you get rich and famous, are you?' " said 
Kraft, who remains cautiously optimistic about the claim. "It would be 
wonderful if it's true, but let's just wait and see."
?????For years, children here have learned that, while the soil rendered 
their food, its hidden riches could one day change their destiny. Few sold 
their mineral rights, even when they let go of their land.
?????As a result, the original landowners are most likely to get any 
royalties from leasing those rights--generally 12.5% to 25% of gross 
production, Blystone said.
?????Revenue from the field could be $7 billion or more over a predicted 
lifetime of 85 years, he said.
?????Among the biggest winners so far appears to be the U.S. government, 
which operates an antenna field for the Voice of America on about 800 acres 
of the 6,600 that Tri-Valley believes harbor natural gas.
?????But Emeterio "Butch" Navalta, who owns the plot where Tri-Valley 
drilled, ignored the screech of the gas well Tuesday and sullenly hoed weeds 
from his 20-acre plot. He bought the land for $60,000 last year but didn't 
get the mineral rights. Although he gets $12,000 a year leasing drilling 
space to Tri-Valley, he is bitter.
?????"I didn't even think about it," Navalta said. "I'm trying to find 
someone who knows what to do."
?????Ruth Hiett, 85-year-old matriarch of a farming family with several 
hundred acres in the claim area, said she'll hold tight to her rights. 
Surrounded by almond trees and fallow fields, she lives in an aging clapboard 
house that is part of the family's original 1906 homestead.
?????"I don't know if it'll make me rich, but it might somebody," Hiett said. 
"Anybody who knows anything at all likes to think some day we'll hit it. But 
some company still has to come and explore and do whatever they have to do. 
Who knows? No telling."

?????'It's Just a Story as Far as I'm Concerned'
?????Thus far, no one knows, or no one is telling. But the prospect of 3 
trillion cubic feet of unassociated, or "dry," gas--meaning it is not mingled 
with oil--in an area that has not shown such deposits before raises ample 
skepticism.
?????"It's just a story as far as I'm concerned," said Lawrence Chroman Jr., 
a third-generation farmer who kept the mineral rights to the land he sold 
Navalta last year. "Whenever the price of gas or oil goes up, they have money 
to go out and do exploration. It goes through cycles. I'm not willing to go 
any further until I see whether this thing develops or not."
?????Experts and regulators likewise cautioned that one gushing well does not 
prove a major find.
?????"All we can say is we are rooting for him," said Don Drysdale, spokesman 
for the state Conservation Department. "It would help us all out. But the 
statements they are making are based on one well. We don't know enough yet."
?????Industry experts note that with natural gas going for $12 per thousand 
cubic feet, plenty of wildcat drillers have been scouring overlooked or 
unlikely places in search of El Dorado. Many find little more than, well, 
Delano.
?????Tri-Valley, a public company whose stock trades at about $1.80, has been 
through bankruptcy protection before, fighting off a hostile takeover by a 
creditor. And it has made one similar claim near Fresno, which proved dry. 
When it announced the Delano find April 11, its stock leaped 75%, and has 
since hovered just under $2.
?????The company will need about $100 million to drill about 40 wells that it 
says could yield a total of 80 million cubic feet per day for about 85 years. 
That is well over the about 50 million cubic feet a day coming from the 
state's most productive field, Rio Vista, according to the Conservation 
Department, but still not enough to ease the state's crisis.
?????But because of the huge amount consumed daily in California, even if 
optimistic estimates in Delano pan out, the production there won't help ease 
the state's crisis.
?????"We're not going to be able to materially affect the power needs of 
California," Blystone cautioned.
?????Bolstering Blystone's claim is the East Lost Hills find reported in 
February by Berkley Petroleum 25 miles west. That discovery has shown early 
promise of being at least as big as the Delano find.
?????The two potential deposits were made public within six weeks of each 
other, and nothing has been the same since in the area.
?????"There's almost been the equivalent of a Gold Rush to lease land all 
around the Berkley field," Kramer said.
?????Drysdale said, however, that his department believes the two finds are 
separate deposits.
?????Tri-Valley has mapped out 6,600 acres, and so far a substantial wedge 
lies within Delano boundaries, where the city owns mineral rights.
?????Virtually everything is speculative about the claim, particularly 
royalties. But city officials think they could make $3 million a year--in a 
town with an operating budget of $6 million, dismally paved roads and 
overcrowded schools.
?????Not only are they considering forming a municipal power authority, but 
they say they will waive about $1,000 in fees to landowners willing to annex 
to the city, which could bring tax benefits on land where the wells might be 
erected.
?????"I'm going to make a one-time offer to all these farmers that the city 
will pick up the cost of annexation," said Matthew Alexander, community 
development director for Delano. "I see this as a window of opportunity."
?????Alexander and others have been to Sacramento to study the pros and cons 
of forming a municipal utility, and are convinced that building a power 
plant, and using gas royalties to power it, is the answer.
?????"You're looking at a totally different town," Blystone said.
?????Small players like Navalta, however, suspect that Delano will be the 
same town as ever for them.
?????"It's supposed to be good for the city," he said. "They're going to get 
a lot of revenue. I just wish I could get something."

California; Opinion Desk
Commentary Don't Write Off Davis Energy Plan
ALAN BLINDER
Alan Blinder, a professor of economics at Princeton University, was vice 
chairman of the Federal Reserve from 1994-96. He is the senior advisor to 
Saber Partners, which is advising Gov. Gray Davis on energy policy

Might Californians finally be seeing a dim light at the end of the energy 
tunnel? This spring and summer will be difficult times unless everything 
breaks just right. But Gov. Gray Davis' recently announced energy plan offers 
at least short-run management of the crisis--and a hope for a long-run 
solution. And that's about all anyone should ask the government to do. 
Ignoring the history and some mind-numbingly complex details, the electricity 
problem comes down to this: Demand now outstrips supply by a wide margin even 
on a normal day, and by much more on days of peak demand. With the utilities 
no longer credit-worthy, the state must fill the gap by buying on the 
wholesale market. These days, that means buying high and selling low.
Any comprehensive attack on this problem must have three components: 
mechanisms for reducing demand, mechanisms for increasing supply and a pile 
of money to cover the bills while the medicine works. The governor's plan, 
while not perfect, has the three elements. It also avoids the wackier 
suggestions from both the right and the left. 
Let's work backward through the three components. First, the state needs 
money to keep the lights on. One naive remedy would be to raise taxes to pay 
all the bills. No danger that any politician will ever latch onto that one. 
But a related bad idea--raising retail electricity rates to cover all the 
costs--does have a following. Why is that a bad idea? Because the utilities 
are saddled with debt from the past. And things almost certainly will be 
brighter (pun intended) in the future. 
Like a family, when a government is faced with a huge, one-time expense--say, 
to build a highway--it generally borrows most of the money. That's sound 
financial practice because it spreads what otherwise would be a ruinously 
high cost over time. Davis wants to spread the cost of the current crisis by 
issuing bonds worth about $12 billion to $13 billion, secured by future 
payments for electricity. I do not know whether this is exactly the right 
number. But the principle is clear, and it's too bad the Legislature delayed 
the bond issue. 
Next comes supply. Wishful thinkers on the right have a simple solution: Just 
let retail prices rise, and more supply will come. The trouble is that it 
won't, at least not in the short run. Over years, greater supply is the only 
lasting solution. But to expect much supply response in the short run is 
dreaming. 
The left has its own favorite silly idea: The state should seize control of 
power plants and take over the business of supplying electricity. Seize? How 
much good would that do to California's business climate? And does anyone 
really believe that the state can, over the long run, generate and supply 
electricity better than private business? There are, in fact, traces of 
public ownership in the Davis plan: The state is buying transmission lines, 
and a new public authority would build power plants if private industry fails 
to do so. But the governor sees public ownership as a last, not a first, 
resort. 
Finally, we come to the demand side, where true believers offer the same 
remedy: Just let the retail price rise enough to cut demand back to the 
available supply. Sound harsh? It is. Higher electricity prices must be part 
of the solution, at least in the short run. But relying exclusively on higher 
rates would be foolhardy and perhaps even ruinous to California's economy, 
because titanic price hikes would be needed to cut demand by enough in short 
order. So we would wind up inflicting pain on consumers without calling forth 
greater generating or transmission capacity. 
The governor at first resisted the conclusion that consumer prices had to 
rise. But he has now embraced it. His package includes not just price hikes 
for big energy users, but also financial incentives for those who reduce 
consumption. More can be done in this regard, but he is at least on the right 
track. 
Will these conservation measures get California through the next few months? 
I wouldn't bet on it. But unless the federal government truly caps wholesale 
electricity prices temporarily, demand management is about the only short-run 
game in town. 
Pray for a cool summer and for a lot more rain behind the dams in the Pacific 
Northwest.



High bills may not spur conservation 
PG&E, critics agree increases are too small to change habits

Looming increases in California power bills may help replenish state coffers 
but will do little to promote conservation or reduce blackouts this summer, 
consumer activists, environmentalists and PG&E said yesterday. 
In a rare convergence of views, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. agreed with the 
utility's sharpest critics that the pending rate increases would be 
insufficient to discourage electricity use. 
While the heaviest residential power customers will see their June bills soar 
by as much as 40 percent, most increases will range between 7 and 15 percent. 
"Based on our studies, residential customers will not respond to changes in 
price signals of less than 20 percent," said Michael Shames, executive 
director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego. 
"Forty percent is probably enough to send a signal," he added. "A 15 percent 
increase is much less likely to have an impact." 
If so, this would undermine what state regulators say is a primary goal of 
the rate increases, scheduled to be adopted Monday. Higher power bills, they 
say, will result in cutbacks in power usage. 
"By promoting energy conservation during summer peak hours," said Loretta 
Lynch, president of the Public Utilities Commission, "we attempt to limit 
blackouts and service interruptions in order to preserve public health and 
safety." 
Gov. Gray Davis, who supports the plan to hand out rebates to those who can 
reduce power use by at least 20 percent, also said higher rates would lead to 
conservation. 
"He thinks that if there's a financial incentive to conserve, then clearly 
consumers will do it," said Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for the governor. 
'NOT GOING TO BE ENOUGH' 
The question now is whether the rate increases planned for customers of PG&E 
and Southern California Edison will do the trick. 
"They're not going to be enough," said Harry Snyder, senior advocate at 
Consumers Union in San Francisco. "This amount is not going to get us the 
levels of conservation we need." 
Helen Burke, who oversees energy matters at the San Francisco Bay chapter of 
the Sierra Club, agreed that a long, hot summer of blackouts remained likely. 
"And if we get more blackouts, I'm sure the rates will have to be ratcheted 
up again," she said. 
A PUC overview of how much typical PG&E bills will rise in June supports the 
idea that the impact for most consumers will be minimal. 
For example, a PG&E customer whose electricity usage is within 200 percent of 
predetermined limits will see monthly bills rise 7 percent, from $95 to $101. 
A heavier user -- within 300 percent of "baseline" limits -- will see monthly 
bills climb 15 percent, from $163 to $187. 
The baseline usage figure -- included near the bottom of PG&E bills -- 
represents the minimal amount of power consumers require. It includes several 
variables, such as climate and time of year. 
Only the heaviest users -- surpassing 400 percent of baseline -- would 
experience rate increases of as much as 40 percent. 
State regulators say almost half of all residential utility customers stay 
within 130 percent of baseline usage and thus would see no change in their 
power bills. 
In other words, the majority of residential customers eligible for higher 
rates would see bills go up by no more than 15 percent. 
John Nelson, a PG&E spokesman, acknowledged that this amount was unlikely to 
promote widespread cuts in electricity usage. 
"Increases on the order of 7 to 15 percent probably won't accomplish much 
conservation," he said. 
"The only way you're going to see significant conservation this summer is a 
combination of higher prices, giving people conservation tips, and raising 
awareness among consumers that we're in a crisis," Nelson said. 
Shames of the Utility Consumers' Action Network said state officials were 
being less than honest when they insisted that the rate increases were meant 
first and foremost as a conservation tool. 
"It's to recoup costs being incurred on the wholesale power market," Shames 
said. "That's it." 
California has spent more than $6 billion since January purchasing 
electricity on behalf of cash-strapped utilities. 
INCREASES TO GENERATE $5 BILLION
The pending rate increases will raise about $5 billion in additional 
revenues, which will be merged with proceeds from a $13.4 billion bond 
offering approved yesterday. 
Yet even these sums represent only a fraction of the estimated $65 billion 
California will spend on electricity this year. 
"What we should be doing is raising rates a lot more," said Severin 
Borenstein, director of the University of California Energy Institute in 
Berkeley. 
He advocated increasing power bills this summer by as much as 75 percent over 
levels paid a year ago. 
"That would get you conserving," Borenstein said.

Power plant owners want end to PG&E contracts 
KAREN GAUDETTE, Associated Press Writer
Friday, May 11, 2001

143EDT0313.DTL&type=news 
(05-11) 00:40 PDT SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- 
The owners of at least 19 small power plants scattered throughout California 
are now asking a bankruptcy judge -- along with state and federal power 
regulators and lawmakers -- to set them free from their contracts with 
bankrupt Pacific Gas and Electric. 
Attorneys for the so-called qualifying facilities said a new pricing system 
recently ordered by the Public Utilities Commission lowers how much the QFs 
can charge for their electricity. That means many actually lose money when 
they run their plants because of soaring natural gas prices. 
Those losses, as well as millions of dollars owed to all the state's roughly 
700 QFs for past deliveries, have forced many of those plants offline, QF 
owners have said. 
But for years QFs -- which harness solar, wind, biomass or geothermal power 
or use natural gas to generate electricity, steam and other energy -- have 
benefitted from the contracts, which allowed them to charge higher prices for 
their electricity. 
The qualifying facilities say that U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Dennis Montali 
should set them free from their contracts, allowing them to sell their 
electricity on the wholesale market instead. 
Critics fear that would allow the QFs to gouge California by matching high 
power prices that have already forced the state to spend $5.2 billion to keep 
the lights on. 
But representatives for four QFs from the Bakersfield area at a bankruptcy 
hearing Thursday pointed to this week's rolling blackouts as evidence the 
state needs every megawatt it can get. And until they get paid a "reasonable 
rate," they can't afford to make electricity in California, they said. 
"If we're paid a rate that doesn't cover our costs we will financially fail," 
said Bruce Leaverton, a lawyer representing the QFs. 
Montali said he didn't think setting a new pricing system was within his job 
description as a bankruptcy judge. 
"Even though your side doesn't like the result, a lot of time and effort has 
gone into this decision," Montali said. He gave both sides until May 24 to 
debate before he makes his decision. 
PG&E said Wednesday that only eight of the 300 QFs within its territory 
remain offline for nonpayment reasons. Others are down for maintenance. The 
Independent System Operator, which manages the state's power grid, said only 
1400 megawatts of QF power remain offline statewide. That's an improvement 
over the 3,000 megawatts down last month. 
The state receives about 6,000 megawatts of electricity from QF, according to 
ISO figures. That's enough to power about 4.5 million homes. 
QF operators say the plants may be online, but they're only generating the 
bare minimum of electricity to get paid.

(05-11) 07:13 PDT (AP) -- 
Developments in California's energy crisis: 
FRIDAY:
* Consumer activists, farmers, corporations and others meet at the Public 
Utilities Commission in San Francisco to argue about how the PUC wants to 
spread around recent rate hikes. 
* State Treasurer Phil Angelides holds briefing about the plan to issue bonds 
to repay the state for power buys. 
* Residents of Mesa Verde and Blythe say they will protest the groundbreaking 
ceremony for the Blythe Energy Project, a 520 megawatt natural gas power 
plant in Southern California. 
* The state remains free of power alerts in the early morning as energy 
reserves stay above 7 percent. 
THURSDAY:
* Grid operators say cooler temperatures are helping them meet California's 
electricity demands. Officials at the Independent System Operator declare a 
Stage 2 emergency, meaning the state is within 5 percent of running out of 
power, but say they don't expect blackouts. 
* The state Assembly and Senate give final approval to a bill expediting 
power plant siting. The bill now goes to the governor for his signature. 
* The PUC holds a public hearing on the proposed rate structure. Two 
proposals are on the table for consideration Monday: Each would make 
businesses and farms pay the most, while shielding most residential 
customers. 
* Gov. Gray Davis signs a bill authorizing $13.4 billion in revenue bonds to 
pay for power for customers of the state's three largest utilities. The bonds 
will repay the state general fund for $6.7 billion authorized for power buys 
since January and will finance future electricity purchases. 
* State officials reveal they spent a record or near-record $1,900 per 
megawatt hour Wednesday to avoid a third consecutive day of rolling 
blackouts. The $319,200 the state paid Reliant Energy for 168 megawatt hours 
at that price was enough to power 168,000 homes for an hour, 
* Owners of small power plants ask U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali to 
order PG&E to release them from contracts to provide it electricity. Montali 
decides to wait until May 24 to make a decision. 
* The California Energy Commission licenses two power plants that should be 
able to deliver 545 megawatts by late summer: a 450-megawatt power plant 
retooling project in Huntington Beach and a 95-megawatt summer reliability 
project in Hanford. 
* A U.S. House subcommittee votes to allow California to extend Daylight 
Savings Time to reduce consumption, among other provisions. But it rejects 
Democratic demands for price controls on wholesale electricity-prices on a 
party-line vote. 
* Inspectors from the PUC and Independent System Operator, which runs the 
state's power grid, make their first check of a reported power plant outage 
under a policy announced Wednesday by Davis to verify generators aren't 
artificially withholding electricity to drive up power prices. They find that 
a 750 megawatt Bay Area plant operated by Mirant Corp. is legitimately down 
for repairs, but is expected to return to service Sunday. 
* Edison International stock closes at $8.91, down 3 cents. PG&E Corp. gained 
a dime to close at $9.10. 
WHAT'S NEXT:
* Davis' representatives continue negotiating with Sempra, the parent company 
of San Diego Gas and Electric Co., to buy the utility's transmission lines. 
THE PROBLEM:
High demand, high wholesale energy costs, transmission glitches and a tight 
supply worsened by scarce hydroelectric power in the Northwest and 
maintenance at aging California power plants are all factors in California's 
electricity crisis. 
Edison and PG&E say they've lost nearly $14 billion since June to high 
wholesale prices the state's electricity deregulation law bars them from 
passing on to consumers. PG&E, saying it hasn't received the help it needs 
from regulators or state lawmakers, filed for federal bankruptcy protection 
April 6. 
Electricity and natural gas suppliers, scared off by the two companies' poor 
credit ratings, are refusing to sell to them, leading the state in January to 
start buying power for the utilities' nearly 9 million residential and 
business customers. The state is also buying power for a third investor-owned 
utility, San Diego Gas & Electric, which is in better financial shape than 
much larger Edison and PG&E but also struggling with high wholesale power 
costs. 
The Public Utilities Commission has approved rate increases of as much as 46 
percent on average to help finance the state's multibillion-dollar power 
buys. The PUC is still determining how those increases will be spread among 
utility customers.

GOP members of House oppose price cap plan 
Three from Southern California vote against Feinstein on electricity

N235199.DTL&type=news 
Washington -- Three California House Republicans voted against Sen. Dianne 
Feinstein's proposal to cap electricity prices yesterday, as California 
Democrats warned the trio would pay at the polls. 
In a test committee vote, Republicans George Radanovich of Fresno, Chris Cox 
of Newport Beach and Mary Bono of Palm Springs all voted against the 
Feinstein proposal, saying it would make blackouts worse. 
California Democrats had offered it as an amendment to a House bill aimed at 
ameliorating California's electricity crisis. The amendment failed 20 to 12 
on a mostly party-line vote. 
Given that there is little the federal government can do immediately to 
increase power supplies to California, price controls have become the pivot 
point of the debate in Washington over how to help the state. 
PRICE-GOUGING ALLEGATIONS
Democrats, led by Feinstein, insist that federal regulators by law must 
intervene when prices become "unjust and unreasonable." Not doing so, they 
contend, puts California consumers at the mercy of price gouging by 
wholesalers. 
Republicans argue price caps would make the situation worse by discouraging 
energy generators from providing power to the state. 
The Democrats held an impromptu press conference in the hallway afterward, 
accusing the Republicans of abandoning their state in its darkest hour. 
"This Republican-dominated committee said that California should drop dead, " 
said Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Los Angeles. 
"I don't know about their districts, but I'll tell you one thing, my 
constituents know that they're being screwed, and they're being screwed by 
the out-of-state generators, and it's up to us to stand up for our 
constituents," said Rep. Anna Eshoo, D-Atherton. "I don't know what those 
Republican members are going to say when they go home." 
ANGRY GOVERNOR
Gov. Gray Davis blasted the Republicans from Sacramento. 
"I find it very surprising that people here in California experiencing this 
energy crisis can go back to Washington and vote against the best interests 
of the constituents of the state," Davis said at a press conference. 
The Republicans argued the Democratic plan would have hurt California. 
"The fact of the matter is, if you put price caps on, you create a better 
investment climate in Uganda than California," Radanovich said, "and I won't 
vote for anything that'll keep us from solving our supply problem." 
Cox contended that price controls would do nothing to prevent blackouts 
because they would not increase supply or reduce demand. 
"In many ways this is for Californians simply changing the subject from our 
immediate problems of May, June and July," Cox said. "No one is contending 
that price controls will help us meet the blackout challenges." 
He also argued that because Feinstein's plan would exempt about half of 
California's power suppliers from the caps, it would open the door to 
"further chaos." 
EXEMPTIONS
Feinstein's bill, co-sponsored by Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., would impose 
temporary price controls on wholesale Western electricity sales. But it 
exempts municipal utilities such as the Los Angeles Department of Water and 
Power and big federal power marketers such as the Bonneville Power 
Administration in Oregon. 
Like private generators, these providers have profited handsomely from 
soaring electricity prices. 
Radanovich said the Democratic effort to force price caps was a way to shift 
the blame for the state's electricity fiasco from "a bumbling governor" 
(Davis) to President Bush. 
The overall bill was approved 17-13 by an Energy and Commerce subcommittee 
chaired by Rep. Joe Barton, R-Tex., who said it "will not stop blackouts," 
but could help increase power supplies this summer.

PUC chief's proposal called petulant 
Federal agencies would pay full tab for power

The state's top energy regulator says her proposal to force federal agencies 
in California to pay "real time" prices for electricity could result in major 
energy savings. 
But critics say the proposal by Public Utilities Commission President Loretta 
Lynch is nothing more than a schoolyard slap at the federal government for 
refusing to rein in skyrocketing wholesale energy prices. 
"It's just saying, 'You weren't nice to us, so we're not going to be nice to 
you,' " said Commissioner Richard Bilas, a Republican, who opposes the 
measure. 
Lynch, a Democrat and appointee of Gov. Gray Davis, introduced the proposal 
this week as part of package of rate increases to be voted on Monday, which 
could jack up monthly electricity bills on heavy residential energy users by 
40 percent and heavy commercial and industrial users by 50 percent or more. 
Under her proposal, federal buildings, offices and military bases -- which 
account for 1.5 percent of the state's energy load -- would pay rates based 
on the fluctuating price of power on the wholesale market, probably leading 
to huge increases at peak times. 
Lynch said Wednesday the plan would force federal agencies to conserve 
energy. She said the measure was not meant to punish the federal government 
for not intervening in California's energy crisis. 
"It's just an experiment," she said. 
"I'm sure what Loretta is saying is, 'Put up or shut up,' " fellow 
Commissioner Jeff Brown, a Democrat, who backs the idea said yesterday. "It 
really puts the monkey on their back." 
Brown said federal officials had urged state regulators to raise rates, 
especially during peak times, to help cut demand. Lynch's plan would put that 
theory to the test on federal buildings, he said. 
Federal officials say they are conserving energy. And earlier this month 
President Bush ordered all federal agencies to cut their electricity use by 
10 percent. 
In California, federal agencies have slashed energy consumption by 25 percent 
since 1992, when Congress passed a law requiring conservation. Federal 
buildings in San Francisco, Oakland and elsewhere are already dimming lights 
and setting thermostats at 78 degrees during power emergencies. 
Mary Filippini, western region spokeswoman for the General Services 
Administration, which manages federal offices, warned that any jump in energy 
costs would have to be passed on to taxpayers. 
Filippini also cautioned that Lynch's proposal could threaten a deal to sell 
California 12 megawatts of electricity a day from the Bonneville Power 
Administration in Washington for $55 a megawatt. The deal went into effect 
March 1. 
"We would have to rethink our contract with them if we had some issues with 
our (energy) pricing," Filippini said. 
Even some advocates of real-time pricing say Lynch's plan to single out 
federal agencies is misguided. 
"It sends the signal that real-time pricing is something to be scared of 
rather than something to really pursue as a tool to help us get through the 
summer," said Jim Bushnell, director of research for the University of 
California Energy Institute.

Sacramento decisions in state's power crisis

In other developments in California's energy crisis yesterday: 
BONDS APPROVED
Gov. Gray Davis signed a bill that will allow the state to issue up to $13. 4 
billion in bonds to repay the general fund for past energy purchases and pay 
for future purchases. 
Davis blasted Republicans, who prevented the bill from passing with a two- 
thirds majority, which delayed the bond issuance for 90 days and scuttled 
Democrats' plans to get short-term loans to quickly replenish what the state 
has already spent out of the general fund on electricity purchases. 
MEGAWATT PRICE SETTLED
State officials confirmed they had spent $1,900 per megawatt hour for a time 
Wednesday as part of the state's effort to avert rolling blackouts. Oscar 
Hidalgo, a spokesman for the Department of Water Resources, said the state 
had purchased 168 megawatts from Reliant Energy at that price over a 
three-hour period on the volatile spot market. 
Hidalgo said it was the highest price per megawatt hour that officials could 
recall paying. The Davis administration has refused to release detailed 
accountings of energy purchases, but documents obtained by The Chronicle this 
year indicated the price per megawatt hour averaged roughly $300 in February 
and March. 
The state began purchasing power Jan. 17 because the state's investor-owned 
utilities could no longer afford to. California has spent about $6 billion so 
far. 
BILL FOR FASTER RESULTS
The Legislature sent Davis a bill intended to allow the state Energy 
Commission and the Air Resources Board to get new power plants operational 
faster. 
The bill shortens the time cities and counties have to review power plant 
projects to 45 days for the initial review and 100 days for the final review. 
It also contains $3 million for cities and counties to defray the cost of 
speeding up reviews of applications for new power plants. 
Davis is expected to sign the bill, which won unanimous approval yesterday in 
the Senate.

State leaders consider scheduled power blackouts 
Posted at 10:09 p.m. PDT Thursday, May 10, 2001 
JOHN WOOLFOLK
State leaders are considering darkening sections of California on a rotating 
schedule as one way to take the frustrating surprise out of the rolling 
blackouts expected to be frequent this summer. 
The proposal to turn off power to large sections of the state on a regular 
basis rather than wait until the last minute to call a rolling blackout drew 
considerable interest among lawmakers. They met to consider the issue 
Thursday, just days after outages swept the state with only minutes of 
warning. 
``We're talking about blackouts of such magnitude we just have to find a way 
to get people better notified,'' said state Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Redondo 
Beach. ``People want to know whether it's in our best interest to simply plan 
for outages, rather than subject ourselves to an out-of-control market. We 
may be better off doing that.'' 
But while scheduling power outages would make blackouts more predictable, it 
may also make them more frequent than necessary. Customers might find 
themselves in the dark even if plenty of power is available. 
But the advantage of planned outages is that by lowering power demand, the 
state could curb the runaway power prices draining its budget and ``break the 
back'' of the energy ``cartel,'' Bowen said. 
Currently, the state pays whatever is necessary to keep the lights on. 
Wednesday, state officials said they paid $1,900 a megawatt-hour to avoid 
blackouts, the most they ever have spent. 
Residents and businesses complain that rolling blackouts would be more 
bearable with more warning. 
``The overwhelming response from our constituents is, `We want 
notification,'?'' said Assemblywoman Jackie Goldberg, D-Los Angeles. 
Businesses pay price 
Carl Guardino, president of the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group and a 
board member of the California Independent System Operator, which runs most 
of the power grid, said rolling blackouts have come with just two minutes' 
warning. He's trying to get a notification plan in place for the summer that 
would allow at least half an hour of notice. 
``A two-minute warning may be appropriate for a football game, but it's 
inadequate to protect California's citizens and economy,'' Guardino said. 
With at least half an hour, businesses could fire up standby generators or 
turn off computers, assembly lines and other equipment that could be damaged 
by sudden blackouts, Guardino said. That could lessen the enormous costs of 
the blackouts to businesses. 
The manufacturing group estimated that the first wave of rolling blackouts, 
which hit the Bay Area during a heat wave June 14, cost Silicon Valley 
companies $100 million. 
A month's worth of blackout days this summer -- a likely possibility -- could 
cost California $16 billion and 15,000 jobs, Guardino said, citing a Bay Area 
Economic Forum analysis. 
Rolling blackouts, in which utilities cut power from one group of customers 
to the next for an hour or so, are ordered when power demand threatens to 
overwhelm available supplies and crash the whole system. It could take days 
to restore power after a systemwide failure. 
Summer is critical because air conditioning is California's biggest power 
use. Grid managers expect the state to be short some 3,700 megawatts, 
particularly in May and June, enough for more than 3 million homes. New power 
plants may lessen the shortage in late summer, but hydroelectric power could 
be more limited then. 
Desert residents object 
With rolling blackouts a virtual certainty, some lawmakers suggested planning 
the entire summer's outages months in advance. 
``I'm interested in calendar blackouts,'' said Assemblyman Mike Briggs, 
R-Fresno. ``I'm talking about calendaring months in advance, `These are your 
potential blackout days.'?'' 
Under the current system, about half of all customers are exempt from rolling 
blackouts because they are essential services like police or hospitals or 
share a circuit with them. The rest are divided among outage groups or blocks 
spread throughout each utility's service area, a move intended to prevent 
blackouts from affecting any region disproportionately. 
Officials from desert districts oppose planning to turn off power in their 
areas. But they suggested reconfiguring circuits so cool coastal areas could 
go dark while hot regions are spared. 
``If you want to black out other parts of the state, that's OK by me,'' said 
Sen. Jim Battin, R-Palm Desert, adding that his desert constituents have paid 
taxes to help coastal residents through earthquakes and mudslides. ``Now it's 
our turn.'' 
The current system for dealing with power shortages was established under the 
state's 1996 deregulation plan, with three stages of emergencies declared as 
demand approaches the limits of supply. 
During Stage 2 emergencies, utilities cut off businesses that have agreed to 
lose power in exchange for lower rates. Stage 3 emergencies indicate rolling 
blackouts are possible. 
But state officials never expected to put such measures in place regularly, 
and the system's flaws have become evident over the past year. 
Grid officials avoid making outage predictions because they fight for every 
last watt, said Terry Winter, the system operator president. 
The system operator faces shortages each morning of anywhere from 7,000 to 
16,000 megawatts, differences usually made up throughout the day by 
conditions that change by the minute, Winter said. 
Planning outages around the state could work, Winter said. But he cautioned 
that transmission constraints, sudden plant outages and weather could still 
mean unexpected outages. 
Lawmakers said even a vague prediction, like a weather forecast, would be 
better than nothing. 
``People listen to the weather forecasters on a regular basis, even when 
they're wrong,'' Goldberg said. 
Winter responded: ``I can be wrong on a regular basis.''

Davis plan to help utility faces fight in Legislature 
Posted at 9:42 p.m. PDT Thursday, May 10, 2001 
BY DION NISSENBAUM 

Mercury News Sacramento Bureau 


SACRAMENTO -- With a plan to issue $13.4 billion in bonds to buy power behind 
them, state lawmakers are confronting their next major energy crisis 
challenge: the governor's controversial plan to bail out nearly bankrupt 
Southern California Edison. 
But that proposal, which has received a cool reception in the Legislature, 
appears all but dead. And various factions are now lining up behind their own 
alternatives. 
``It has a snowball's chance'' in hell, Assemblywoman Sarah Reyes, D-Fresno, 
said of the governor's deal. 
Moderate Democrats want to give Edison $1.5 billion less for its transmission 
lines than Davis offered, while liberals are calling for the outright 
takeover of the company. 
And some lawmakers are growing concerned that the divisions will force Edison 
to follow the lead of its northern cousin, Pacific Gas & Electric Co., and 
declare bankruptcy. 
Despite the hurdles, Davis remains optimistic. On Thursday, the governor said 
he still thinks a modified version of his plan will ultimately win support 
from lawmakers. 
``It's one legislator at a time, but I believe we are making progress,'' said 
Davis, who met with legislative leaders Thursday afternoon to discuss his 
proposal and the alternatives. 
Davis trumpeted his deal with Edison last month just days after PG&E stunned 
the governor and state by filing for bankruptcy protection. The two utilities 
amassed enormous debts buying expensive electricity, but could not pass those 
costs on to their customers because the state has capped rates. 
Too little, too much 
The Edison agreement has been met with a barrage of criticism from all sides. 
Some lawmakers think the state has offered too much -- $2.76 billion -- to 
buy Edison's share of the transmission system used to shuttle electricity 
around California. Others complain that the deal doesn't force Edison to 
``share the pain'' and return some of its profits from generating power. 
Some question the agreement to protect 20,000 acres of Edison-owned 
wilderness and think it goes too far in allowing continued logging. Others 
think it doesn't go far enough. 
``I don't know of anybody who has said, `Yeah, this is a good deal,'?'' said 
Assemblyman Joe Nation, D-San Rafael. 
Nation sits on what Assembly Democrats have dubbed their Plan B task force, 
which is looking at ways to rework the Edison deal or craft a different 
proposal. 
Nation and Assemblyman John Dutra, D-Fremont, are shopping around a 
slimmed-down version of the Edison deal that would give the state a three- to 
five-year option to buy the transmission lines for $1.2 billion -- $1.5 
billion less than the current offer. 
The lawmakers also want to compel power companies to write off some of their 
profits and require Edison to use $400 million from its parent company to 
help pay off the utility's debt. 
Other lawmakers are floating the idea of buying the entire utility instead of 
just its transmission lines. Under that proposal, if Edison goes bankrupt, 
the state would buy its stock and take control of the utility's dams and 
nuclear plants, as well as its debts. 
That alternative, however, has garnered little support from moderates. 
``This idea that we step in and purchase the entire utility is an East German 
model,'' Nation said. 
Edison executives have cautioned lawmakers not to tinker too much with the 
deal. The company has launched a $3 million media campaign to curry public 
favor. 
Brian Bennett, Edison's vice president for external affairs, said the company 
is open to some changes -- as long as nothing throws the tenuous agreement 
out of whack. 
Risk of bankruptcy 
``Ideally, we would hope that after all the teeth gnashing that's going on, 
they'll see how difficult it is to reach an agreement and that, in the end, 
they'll adopt it in large part the way it is now,'' Bennett said. 
At this point, none of the options appear to have enough momentum. And this 
stalemate, some worry, could force Edison -- like PG&E before it -- to throw 
up its hands and declare bankruptcy. 
``It's really bite-the-bullet time,'' said one senior Edison executive. 
``Come up with a plan or we go bankrupt, and they deal with the fallout.''

Power plant owners want end to PG&E contracts 
Posted at 6:38 a.m. PDT Friday, May 11, 2001 
BY KAREN GAUDETTE 

Associated Press Writer 



SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The owners of at least 19 small power plants scattered 
throughout California are now asking a bankruptcy judge -- along with state 
and federal power regulators and lawmakers -- to set them free from their 
contracts with bankrupt Pacific Gas and Electric. 
Attorneys for the so-called qualifying facilities said a new pricing system 
recently ordered by the Public Utilities Commission lowers how much the QFs 
can charge for their electricity. That means many actually lose money when 
they run their plants because of soaring natural gas prices. 
Those losses, as well as millions of dollars owed to all the state's roughly 
700 QFs for past deliveries, have forced many of those plants offline, QF 
owners have said. 
But for years QFs -- which harness solar, wind, biomass or geothermal power 
or use natural gas to generate electricity, steam and other energy -- have 
benefitted from the contracts, which allowed them to charge higher prices for 
their electricity. 
The qualifying facilities say that U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Dennis Montali 
should set them free from their contracts, allowing them to sell their 
electricity on the wholesale market instead. 
Critics fear that would allow the QFs to gouge California by matching high 
power prices that have already forced the state to spend $5.2 billion to keep 
the lights on. 
But representatives for four QFs from the Bakersfield area at a bankruptcy 
hearing Thursday pointed to this week's rolling blackouts as evidence the 
state needs every megawatt it can get. And until they get paid a ``reasonable 
rate,'' they can't afford to make electricity in California, they said. 
``If we're paid a rate that doesn't cover our costs we will financially 
fail,'' said Bruce Leaverton, a lawyer representing the QFs. 
Montali said he didn't think setting a new pricing system was within his job 
description as a bankruptcy judge. 
``Even though your side doesn't like the result, a lot of time and effort has 
gone into this decision,'' Montali said. He gave both sides until May 24 to 
debate before he makes his decision. 
PG&E said Wednesday that only eight of the 300 QFs within its territory 
remain offline for nonpayment reasons. Others are down for maintenance. The 
Independent System Operator, which manages the state's power grid, said only 
1400 megawatts of QF power remain offline statewide. That's an improvement 
over the 3,000 megawatts down last month. 
The state receives about 6,000 megawatts of electricity from QF, according to 
ISO figures. That's enough to power about 4.5 million homes. 
QF operators say the plants may be online, but they're only generating the 
bare minimum of electricity to get paid.










Businesses blast electricity rate-hike proposal 
Posted at 9:59 p.m. PDT Thursday, May 10, 2001 
BY SAM DIAZ 

Mercury News 


Silicon Valley businesses are crying foul at the latest rate hike proposal by 
the California Public Utilities Commission, arguing they are being unfairly 
singled out and that the ripple effect will cause long-lasting damage to the 
state's economic health. 
State regulators on Wednesday put forward a plan that would hit commercial, 
industrial and agricultural users with potential power bill increases of 50 
percent or more while leaving moderate residential users mostly shielded. 
The commission is expected to vote on the proposal Monday. 
The idea that businesses would carry the expense of the energy crisis on 
their shoulders has left some fuming and others screaming for a real-time 
pricing plan that would reward those who conserve during high-demand hours 
and penalize those who don't -- both on the residential and business levels. 
``We have been in front of the PUC with court pleadings, we've filed briefs, 
we've met with everyone we can meet with inside the governor's office,'' said 
Earl Bouse, a vice president with Hansen Permanente Cement, which operates a 
plant off Interstate 280 in Cupertino. 
``With this sort of rate shift, industry simply cannot operate in California. 
I'm hoping and praying that this is all just an administrative error of 
stupidity.'' 
The idea that businesses would flee the Golden State as fast as they flocked 
to it during the dot-com boom is very real under the PUC's proposal, said 
Carl Guardino, president and CEO of the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group. 
``The PUC may think that by shielding residential customers from paying our 
proportionate share that they are doing everyone a favor yet it's pretty hard 
to pay your bills when a disproportionate plan forces your employer out of 
business or out of California,'' Guardino said. 
In recent months, states such as Michigan, Tennessee and West Virginia have 
been courting California businesses, assuring them that the availability of 
power is not a problem in their states. 
And while a move may be enticing for some businesses, others have too much 
invested in their Silicon Valley presence to simply up and leave. 
Real-time pricing 
Cisco Systems, San Jose's largest employer, won't be packing up anytime soon, 
said company spokesman Steve Langdon. ``San Jose is our home, and we fully 
intend to stay here,'' he said. 
But that doesn't mean the company isn't frustrated with the thought of being 
hit with exorbitant energy bills, especially when it has gone out of its way 
to conserve. 
Cisco has installed special lighting, retrofitted windows and put usage 
regulators on equipment motors to help reduce energy, Langdon said. 
But it seems that it's still not enough as the state gears up for a hot 
summer and a demand for energy that is expected to exceed the supply. 
There's been a call to develop a real-time pricing plan that would arm 
residents and businesses with the data -- and financial incentives -- to cut 
usage during the peak afternoon hours. 
Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economics professor and chairman of the 
Market Surveillance Committee for the agency that operates California's 
electricity transmission system, said energy pricing needs to be done in real 
time. 
``If you increase the rate I pay for power in every hour, when am I going to 
reduce my consumption?'' he asked. Power users will reduce during the hours 
that save them the most money, he said. 
But that involves putting users on real-time energy monitoring plans. 
Currently, most residents and businesses are charged a monthly rate for their 
total usage, regardless of whether that usage was at 4 p.m. or 4 a.m. 
Adjusting rates 
By adjusting the rates for the time of day -- and monitoring usage by the 
hour -- customers could save money by conserving when energy costs are high 
and using energy when costs are low. The financial incentive would also 
reduce the demand during those peak hours. 
According to PG&E, only about 3,200 businesses in its operating region have 
real-time meters -- without real time pricing. The meters allow customers to 
monitor when their heaviest usage is and adjust it accordingly. But without 
the financial savings, there's little incentive to do anything more with the 
data except to analyze it. 
Hansen Permanente Cement is one of those businesses with a real-time meter. 
``We recommended charging us more on the peak side and in the off-peak 
leaving the rate where it was to begin in with,'' Hansen's Bouse said. But 
the request fell on deaf ears, he said. 
``The opinion was that no one was listening,'' he said. ``There might as well 
have been no pleadings.''

Households must share power costs 
Published Friday, May 11, 2001, in the San Jose Mercury News 
FEAR of raising rates for household use of electricity has hindered the 
resolution of California's energy crisis since it exploded in December. 
A rate increase that could have saved the utilities from financial 
catastrophe, had it been approved in January, eventually was enacted March 
27. In the meantime, the state had to jump into the business of buying power 
when Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison ran out of money. 
Now, the California Public Utilities Commission looks set to stumble again 
for fear of consumer wrath. A proposal from Loretta Lynch, PUC president, on 
which electricity users will carry the burden of the March rate increase, 
goes too light on residents. 
Low-income residents should be protected, and they will be. But raising bills 
for the rest of us an average of only $6 for using twice the baseline amount 
isn't sending residents the necessary conservation message. (Baselines 
establish minimal levels -- about two-thirds of average usage.) Many 
households can afford an increase of more than $6 a month. 
Since residents aren't paying, businesses will have to. The average 
residential rate, including those who would get no increase at all, is 17 
percent. The average industrial increase is 52 percent. 
The full PUC should adjust the proportions, not to let business off the hook, 
but to dial its share back as the residential share gets dialed up. 
``Let business pay'' goes only so far in protecting residential customers. 
Residents are, after all, employees too. If the companies they work for are 
burdened too heavily, jobs start evaporating in the summer heat. 
Lynch's proposal does point in some positive directions. It sets prices in 
five tiers, meaning the price per kilowatt steps up as usage increases for 
residents. 
For large customers, the proposal makes some progress toward real-time 
pricing -- that is, charging more for power at times of peak demand to 
reflect the greater cost of buying it then. 
But the state should have initiated a more aggressive conservation, metering 
and real-time pricing program months ago. And it should be hastening to get 
residents involved in it too.










Failure to conserve fueled energy woes 
Published Friday, May 11, 2001, in the San Jose Mercury News 
BY PAUL KRUGMAN 
GASOLINE prices are rising again, and the administration is rushing to turn 
this into another argument for its drill-and-burn energy strategy. But a look 
at the causes of the current gasoline shortage actually suggests a quite 
different moral: namely, that conservation ought to be a major element in our 
energy strategy, and that lack of conservation is a large part of what we've 
been doing wrong. 
First things first: This year's gasoline price spike has nothing to do with a 
shortage of crude oil. Even if we had already punched the Alaskan tundra and 
the ocean floor off Florida full of holes, we'd still be in the same fix. The 
binding constraint right now is the nation's limited capacity to refine crude 
oil into gasoline. 
Why is refining capacity inadequate? No new refineries have been built in 
this country for 20 years, a point emphasized with obvious relish by Dick 
Cheney. His implicit subtext, of course, is that it's the fault of 
environmentalist types who stood in the oil industry's way. That must be the 
story, right? 
Wrong. It's true that environmental rules have somewhat crimped the 
production of our existing refineries. The problem is not so much the 
strictness of the regulations as their lack of consistency: Each region has 
its own rules -- like the insistence of Midwestern states that gasoline 
include corn-derived ethanol -- fragmenting the nation's production. But the 
reason the oil industry didn't build any new refineries for two decades was 
that they weren't needed. In fact, right up until last year oil refining was 
a persistently depressed business, plagued by overcapacity. 
Here's what happened: In the wake of the energy crisis in the 1970s, ordinary 
people in the United States began conserving energy -- not as a ``sign of 
personal virtue,'' as Cheney sneeringly puts it, but because they wanted to 
save money. Cars, in particular, became much more fuel-efficient. Meanwhile, 
the oil industry was subject to ``refinery creep,'' the tendency of refining 
capacity to grow through incremental improvements even when no new refineries 
are built. The result was excess capacity and squeezed margins, right up to 
the late 1990s. 
What finally brought us up against capacity constraints was a surge in demand 
that was partly due to the economic boom of the later Clinton years, but 
mainly due to the renewed enthusiasm of Americans for huge, gas-guzzling 
vehicles -- an enthusiasm, er, fueled by cheap gas. In 1998 gasoline was 
cheaper compared with overall consumer prices than ever before in U.S. 
history -- 60 percent cheaper than it was in 1981. The nation rushed out to 
buy ever-bigger SUVs -- and then suddenly discovered that we had run out of 
refining capacity. Refiners weren't frustrated by rules that prevented them 
from building new facilities; they were simply caught by surprise. 
You have to bear this history in mind when parsing Cheney's recent speeches. 
To listen to him, you would imagine that we live in a country in which 
powerful political forces oppose energy production and preach a return to the 
Dark Ages. ``To speak exclusively of conservation,'' Cheney declared in one 
speech, ``is to duck the tough issues .?.?. it is not a sufficient basis -- 
all by itself -- for a sound, comprehensive energy policy.'' In another 
speech he ridiculed unspecified types for ``saying to the American people 
that you have to live in the dark, turn out all of the lights.'' The story 
according to Cheney, in other words, is that we have an energy shortage 
because extreme conservationists prevented us from developing the supply 
capacity that serious people knew we needed. 
Need I point out that this, like so much of what one hears from this 
administration, is a cynical misrepresentation? I defy Cheney to come up with 
examples of influential people who ``speak exclusively of conservation,'' let 
alone anyone who says to the American people that they have to live in the 
dark. In fact, hardly any important politicians have spoken about 
conservation at all -- never mind exclusively -- this past decade. 
We will need to build more refineries -- and more power plants, and 
pipelines, and so on. But it is ludicrous to suggest that our current energy 
woes are the result of too much emphasis on conservation. It would be closer 
to the truth to say that we are in trouble now because our politicians 
haven't dared even use the word.

Generators win 10-year revival 
To Huntington Beach officials' dismay, AES nets a long-term permit to fire up 
old but refurbished units.

California's electricity needs trumped local environmental concerns Thursday 
as AES Corp. received a 10-year permit to fire up two old generators at its 
Huntington Beach power plant - angering city officials who wanted to restrict 
the permit to five years. 
The California Energy Commission allowed AES to restart the 40-year-old 
generators on the condition that the company sell all power from the units to 
the state. 
"We're certainly disappointed in having a 10-year permit, not five years,'' 
said Huntington Mayor Pam Julien-Houchen. 
Huntington Beach is the first full-time power plant approved under a 
fast-track permitting process ordered by Gov. Gray Davis in January. In 
addition, seven "peaker'' plants, which operate only during hours of peak 
demand, have been approved since January. 
The approval ends a contentious five-month process that pitted Huntington 
Beach officials against the company. 
The city, concerned about air and water pollution, wants AES to replace the 
plant with a modern, cleaner one. To gain approval to restart the mothballed 
generators, AES agreed to pay $2.5 million for studies of the plant's effect 
on ocean bacteria that may have contributed to beach closures. 
In order to get the units running by mid-July, AES plans to begin nearly 
round-the-clock construction "in a matter of days,'' said Aaron Thomas, a 
company spokesman.

Davis signs bill to sell $13.4 billion in bonds for power 
May 11, 2001 
From Register news services 
SACRAMENTO Gov. Gray Davis signed a bill allowing the state to issue $13.4 
billion in bonds to buy electricity, the largest municipal bond offering in 
U.S. history. 
The bonds will be issued as early as August and will help repay the general 
fund. California has spent more than $6 billion buying power for PG&E Corp.'s 
Pacific Gas & Electric and Edison International's Southern California Edison, 
the state's two largest utilities. California is spending more than $50 
million a day buying power, the state Department of Finance said. 
"This is part of the solution, but it's not going to end all the problems. 
It's not going to stop until we start using less power or generating more 
power," said Clark Stamper, head of Stamper Capital & Investments in Santa 
Cruz, which manages about $430 million of municipal bonds. 
Blackouts averted -- at $1,900 per megawatt-hour 
SACRAMENTO The state spent as much as $1,900 a megawatt-hour to buy power 
Wednesday as state grid operators narrowly avoided a third consecutive day of 
blackouts, Gov. Gray Davis said, reiterating his call for federal price caps. 
The $1,900 is a record or near record since the state purchases began in 
January, said Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the power-buying Department of 
Water Resources. The $319,200 the department paid Reliant Energy for 168 
megawatt hours at that price was enough to power 126,000 homes for an hour, 
Hidalgo said. 
Reliant spokesmen did not return telephone messages from the Associated Press 
Thursday. 
Task force wants more funds to promote efficiency 
WASHINGTON A White House task force will recommend more funding for programs 
that promote energy efficiency, reversing some cuts made by President George 
W. Bush, a senior administration official said. 
The task force on energy policy, led by Vice President Dick Cheney, wants to 
review current funding for conservation and renewable sources of power and 
propose "appropriate" increases for those considered valuable by private 
companies, including Alcoa Inc., Bethlehem Steel Corp. and Weyerhaeuser Co. 
The recommendation follows lobbying by oil, aluminum, mining, paper, metal 
and steel companies last month against administration efforts to cut federal 
financing of energy-related research. 
















Not saving for a sultry day 
Some officials say conservation efforts so far aren't enough. Consumers say 
they're trying.

If Californians had conserved just 500 more megawatts - 1.5 percent -- the 
rolling blackouts this week could have been prevented. 
The state Energy Commission and the governor have been congratulating 
consumers for slashing their energy use by 9 percent. 
But some experts question those numbers. 
And, even the forecaster who compiled those figures called them "squishy." 
Operators of the state's power grid complain each time that supplies get 
short that Californians aren't trying hard enough to save - although they 
acknowledge they have no scientific way of measuring conservation. 
"Tuesday we forecast a peak demand of 35,500 megawatts. The actual peak was 
35,755. You tell me: How much conservation was there?'' asked Lisa Szot, 
senior engineer at the California Independent System Operator. 
Interviews and records show that Californians are taking baby steps, changing 
light bulbs and shutting off appliances. But for most, conservation is not a 
priority. Until power bills rise dramatically and blackouts hit their homes, 
it probably won't be, experts say. 
One thing is clear: Californians are not now conserving enough to keep the 
lights on during hot days. And experts think it will get worse as the weather 
gets hotter. 
"Californians can conserve their way out of this crisis,'' said Severin 
Borenstein, an energy economist at the University of California Energy 
Institute in Berkeley. 
"But I'm pretty skeptical of that 9 percent savings figure, given what we're 
seeing on the demand side so far." 
Demand for power on the hottest day last month was down 5 percent from 2000 
-- 1,580 megawatts. 
Factor in the higher usage expected because of warmer weather and economic 
percent growth, and you have the 9 percent savings calculated by the Energy 
Commission and touted by Gov. Gray Davis. 
Richard Rohrer, an energy forecaster for the commission, said his numbers 
include an adjustment for weather. That has the effect of making demand look 
lower than what the ISO is measuring. 
"The data are squishy, but the numbers are telling a story. Peak demands are 
lower. Monthly energy use is lower,'' Rohrer said. 
Crisis a concern, but 'You've Got to Live' 
From the sidewalk of a Lake Forest street, the buzz of Liz Dye's 
air-conditioning unit broke the silence. 
It was Tuesday at 3 p.m., and rolling blackouts were just about to begin. 
Dye, 40, says she waits until 1 a.m. to run her dishwasher and has taught her 
children to flip off lights when no one's in the room. But the Dye family 
needed a little cool-down Tuesday. 
"I'll keep it on for two hours and then turn it off,'' she said. 
In Mission Viejo, Norma Roman was at the laundromat washing a California 
king-size comforter that won't fit into her home machine. 
Roman, 33, says she dresses lightly so she can keep off the air conditioning 
in her home, using ceiling fans instead. But Tuesday she was taking advantage 
of a break in her schedule to wash the comforter, even as Southern California 
Edison cut power to nearby neighborhoods. 
"You take it into consideration, but you've got to live,'' Roman said. 
That's pretty much the way most folks sized it up. 
"Energy efficiency? No factor," said Jeff Ganoe, 38, of Garden Grove, on how 
he chose the dryer he bought at Home Depot this week after his old machine 
conked out. Color and style were more important factors. 
What would it take to make him conserve? 
"More blackouts," he said. "My electricity bill's only $10. But blackouts are 
a big pain. I might change." 
If the energy crisis is a war, then it seems we haven't seen enough 
casualties yet to pitch in and do our part. 
The most popular energy-saving item these days is a $15 curlicue of glass 
called the compact fluorescent light bulb. They screw into a typical 
incandescent socket, last 13 times longer and use one-quarter the energy. 
At this stage of California's energy crisis, they constitute the front line: 
a small investment, eventual savings, and a tinge of pride about doing the 
right thing. 
"It's definitely saving me money," said John Irwin, 61, of Garden Grove. "And 
I may not have to look at blackouts." 
That remains to be seen. 
On the hottest days between June and September, demand for electricity on the 
California grid is forecast to be 47,500 megawatts, or about one-third more 
than what led to this week's rolling blackouts. This week, big generating 
stations that could have provided more than 12,000 megawatts of power weren't 
running, primarily because they were down for maintenance. 
Plus some alternative-energy generators, which make 700 megawatts of power 
from the wind and the sun, were refusing to generate power because the 
utilities owe them millions of dollars. 
Counting on a change in behavior 
In total the ISO has generating capacity of about 44,000 megawatts and on 
most days imports another 4,000 megawatts of power. That's just barely enough 
to cover the forecasted energy needs-if nothing goes wrong. 
Davis and the Legislature have enacted new conservation programs. 
But independent experts don't think these efforts will save enough power - 
and they say the increases most consumers will see on their June power bills 
won't be enough to spark a change in behavior. 
Borenstein, the Berkeley economist, said he was in the state Capitol on 
Tuesday, just before the blackouts. 
"It was a typical summer day, and the temperature inside was 72 or 74 
degrees, men were wearing suits and ties, and nobody was sweating,'' said 
Borenstein. 
"If you turned all the air conditioning to 80 degrees, that alone could go 
most of the way to avoiding blackouts,'' he said. 
"That's not pleasant, I know. But we are going to need aggressive action.''











Despite opposition, AES has the power 
Many in Huntington Beach want the aging plant to run for five years, not 10. 
May 11, 2001 
By KATE BERRY, JIMMY CHAI and CURT SEEDEN
The Orange County Register 
California's dire need for electricity took precedence Thursday over the 
desires of Huntington Beach residents and city officials, who had struggled 
to limit two 40-year-old generators at the AES Corp. power plant to a 
five-year license. 
Though residents and city officials recognize that California is mired in an 
energy crisis, many expressed dismay that AES received a 10-year operating 
permit for generators, which will undergo a $130 million refurbishment. The 
California Energy Commission granted the permit on the condition that all the 
power from the units be sold to the state. 
"What they expressed to us is that they needed 10 years to make the plant 
financially viable,'' said Garret Shean, a commission hearing officer. 
Matthew Lamb, the city's real estate service manager, who has been on the 
front lines of negotiations between the city, AES and the commission, said 
any chance for a new plant at the site will now be shelved for 10 years. 
"We can't argue that California needs the power,'' he said. "But this 
community wants to have a modern plant. California doesn't want 1960s 
technology that needs to be jump-started.'' 
Though residents complain about air and water pollution, many expected the 
permit to be approved. 
"If we really need the power, I don't object,'' said Don Stack, who lives 
near the plant at Newland Street and Pacific Coast Highway. 
Aaron Thomas, a spokesman for Arlington, Va.-based AES, said the two units 
are expected to be online in July, producing 450 megawatts - enough to light 
from 337,500 to 450,000 homes. 
"This facility will be cleaner than any of the new facilities coming online 
over the next couple of years.'' 
City officials said they were led to believe that the units would receive a 
five-year permit and then be subject to a completely new certification 
process. Instead, the commission granted a full 10-year permit, with an 
interim review after five years. That review would ensure the plant is in 
compliance with the permit, which requires environmental studies and steps to 
mitigate ocean bacteria levels if studies link the plant to bacteria that 
have caused beach closures. 
City officials have asked the company to build a low-profile, modern plant, 
similar to an AES plant under construction in Redondo Beach. A new plant 
would replace all five units on the 53-acre site in Huntington Beach 
overlooking the Pacific. 
Malcolm Weiss, a lawyer for the city, said officials are considering whether 
to appeal the permit. The city also could file an appeal with the South Coast 
Air Quality Management District, which is expected to issue an air-quality 
permit and emissions credits to the plant within days so that construction 
can begin, Weiss said. 
The Huntington Beach plant's five units include one peaker unit, which 
operates only during Stage 3 power shortages. It will be required by the 
commission to install air pollution controls by December 2002. The plant's 
Units 1 and 2 currently are offline while catalytic converters that reduce 
pollutants are installed. Those units are expected to be on line by July. 








National Desk; Section A 
Many Utilities Call Conserving Good Business 
By TIMOTHY EGAN

The New York Times 
Page 1, Column 6 
c. 2001 New York Times Company 
SEATTLE, May 10 -- More than 20 years ago, as power companies were building 
nuclear plants across the country to meet the need for new electricity, 
Seattle City Light invested instead in measures to promote energy efficiency. 
In the years since, some of those plants have ended up in default, while 
Seattle has saved enough energy to power the entire city for 18 months. 
Hundreds of miles to the south, the city-run utilities in Los Angeles and 
Sacramento, have generally managed to avoid the rolling blackouts of recent 
months by opting out of the state's deregulation experiment and promoting 
conservation with near-religious fervor. 
''Over the last ten years, we have conserved enough energy to save us the 
equivalent of having to build one huge new power plant,'' said Mike Weedall, 
a manager at the Sacramento Municipal Utility District. ''Instead, we like to 
say we built the conservation power plant.'' 
When Vice President Dick Cheney said last week that conservation could not be 
a centerpiece of energy policy, he left some utilities -- those that have 
spent 20 years trying to prove just the opposite -- feeling as though their 
efforts had been undermined. In his speech, he said, ''Conservation may be a 
sign of personal virtue, but it is not a sufficient basis for a sound, 
comprehensive energy policy.'' The nation, he said, should build a new power 
plant every week for the next 20 years. 
In recent days, Bush Administration officials have emphasized that their 
energy policy will include some financial incentives for alternative power 
and energy efficiency. But they said that the nation still needs to build 
thousands of new power plants, no matter how well energy is used. 
Bob Royer, a spokesman for the municipally run Seattle City Light utility, 
agreed that the country needs to build more power capacity. But he said that 
conservation efforts worked because they proved more popular with his 
utility's customers. 
''These guys in the Bush administration are doing this manly stuff, putting 
their horns on to make it sound like conservation is for sissies,'' Mr. Royer 
said. ''But we know from experience that conservation equals generation. They 
are the same.'' 
Other utilities, even some that embrace conservation, agree with the Bush 
administration that the nation cannot conserve its way to energy 
independence. 
''Cheney is saying that conservation won't solve the energy crisis, and we 
agree with that,'' said Gary Swofford, a vice president for Puget Sound 
Energy, a private utility that serves nearly a million customers in western 
Washington. The company has just won approval from regulators to start a 
program that lets people play less when they use electricity during 
low-demand times . 
Officials at most utilities say that some new power is needed to meet growth. 
But many say that up to half of it can come from conservation or reliance on 
renewable resources like wind, solar or small hydroelectric plants. This does 
not have to involve personal sacrifice, as the Bush administration has 
implied, these power providers say. 
In California, where the state is offering cash incentives for people to use 
more energy-efficient appliances and lights, S. David Freeman, the man named 
by Gov. Gray Davis to oversee the state's response to its power crisis, said 
that conservation remained a way not only to get through the difficult summer 
ahead but also to meet long-term energy needs. 
''I've got a message for the vice president: conservation is not a dirty word 
in California,'' Mr. Freeman said on Friday in addressing a gathering of 
state business leaders. 
And in the Northwest, conservation is not just a civic virtue, it's written 
in the main law governing how the region uses its power. 
Twenty years ago, Congress ordered the Bonneville Power Administration, which 
markets the hydroelectric energy from this region's extensive network of 
dams, to make conservation the priority to meet future power needs. 
Instead of building new dams or nuclear plants, the region promoted energy 
efficiency, in everything from residential building codes to industrial 
plants. In normal weather years, the Northwest usually has a large surplus of 
electricity. 
''This has nothing to do with austerity or being a greenie,'' said Tom 
Eckman, the conservation manager of the Northwest Power Planning Council, 
which was created by Congress to guide major power decisions in this region. 
''It's common sense. If you can get something for 10 cents, why pay a dollar 
for it?'' 
Officials at even some big private utilities say that choosing conservation 
over big new power plants has paid off for them. The Potomac Electric Power 
Company, which serves nearly 600,000 customers in Maryland and the District 
of Columbia, has invested $360 million on conservation in the last 10 years, 
eliminating the need for at least two medium-sized power plants, company 
officials said. 
''With conservation, we were able to avoid building those big power plants, 
and it was ultimately cheaper,'' said Bob Dobkin, a spokesman for the 
company. 
Mr. Cheney said that the Bush administration would oppose any measure based 
on a premise that people should do more with less. His remark was echoed this 
week by Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman. 
Asked on Monday if Mr. Bush believed that Americans should change their 
lifestyles in the face of a power crisis, Mr. Fleischer dismissed the idea of 
people using less energy as one solution. 
''That's a big no,'' said Mr. Fleischer. ''The president believes that it's 
an American way of life, and it should the goal of policy makers to protect 
the American way of life. The American way of life is a blessed one. And we 
have a bounty of resources in this country.'' 
But a number of utilities say that giving people financial incentives to use 
less energy has been tremendously popular, prompting people to change some 
small habits of their lives. 
''Our phones are just ringing off the hook,'' said Mr. Weedall of Sacramento, 
referring to consumer response to the utility's 20 different conservation 
programs. ''Mr. Cheney seems to be saying that you shouldn't have to do 
without all the electronic toys you want. We agree. But you can do it 
efficiently. You don't always have to build the new power plant.'' 
No matter what comes from the president's initiative, the utilities say 
creative conservation is here to stay -- because the public wants it. In 
Spokane, Wash., a large private power provider, Avista Utilities, has just 
won approval from state regulators for a plan in which they would pay 
consumers for using less electricity. The average homeowner could get as much 
as $10 a month by simply changing habits, utility officials said. 
Avista has aggressively promoted conservation, dispensing coupons for 
discounts on energy-efficient lightbulbs, and offering financial incentives 
for businesses and schools to change their appliances and lighting. 
The Los Angeles city utility, which serves 3.8 million people in Los Angeles, 
has been offering customers cash rebates of as much as $10,000 a home to 
convert to solar energy. 
''We took our cue from the Water Department, which added a million new 
customers but its overall water use has stayed the same,'' said Angelina 
Galiteva, an executive director with the Los Angeles utility. ''Why not try 
to do the same thing with power?''

PG&E Files Opposition to Ratepayers' Committee



SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 9, 2001 via NewsEdge Corporation  -
Pacific Gas and
Electric Company today filed a motion with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court
asking the court to vacate the United States Trustee's (UST)
appointment of the Ratepayers' Committee. The filing indicates that
the creation of a Ratepayers' Committee exceeded the authority of the
UST because it was inconsistent with express provisions of the federal
Bankruptcy Code.


Pacific Gas and Electric Company appreciates that its Chapter 11
filing and Plan of Reorganization may create concerns for the
company's customers. Under the Bankruptcy Code, there are legitimate
ways by which the ratepayers can be represented and heard in the
process, for example, through the California Attorney General's
Office. In addition, the bankruptcy code provides flexibility and
discretion to the court to allow parties to intervene in the case when
they have standing to do so.


The utility does not object to ratepayers having a voice in the
process, when issues arise where the court determines they have
standing, but does object to procedures that are outside of the
existing Bankruptcy Code.


In its filing, Pacific Gas and Electric Company says the
"organizations and individuals appointed to the Ratepayers' Committee
-- and the ratepayers whose interests they supposedly represent -- are
neither creditors nor equity security holders and therefore not
eligible for appointment to a committee by the UST under Section
1102(a)(1). Thus, the UST's appointment of the Ratepayers' Committee
was not authorized by the Bankruptcy Code and constitutes an abuse of
discretion by the UST."

SCE to Curtail 'Load' for Some Customers Following Stage 2 Electrical 
Emergency Declaration



ROSEMEAD, Calif., May 10 /PRNewswire/  via NewsEdge Corporation  -
The California Independent System
Operator (Cal-ISO) again declared a Stage 2 Emergency this afternoon due to
low power reserves and increased demand for power because of high
temperatures.  The agency called upon Southern California Edison and other
investor-owned utilities to begin voluntary "load" curtailment programs for
certain customers within their service areas.


Cal-ISO said the Stage 2 Emergency would be in effect from 1 p.m. through
midnight.  Cal-ISO and SCE are making urgent appeals for all customers to
immediately reduce their electricity consumption so that reserve levels do not
deteriorate further.


To achieve this load reduction, at 1:48 p.m. SCE activated its voluntary
load curtailment program, under which large industrial, commercial, and
agricultural customers have agreed to temporarily curtail electricity usage
during an electrical emergency in exchange for reduced rates.


Should the situation worsen for any reason, and power reserves drop below
1.5%, Cal-ISO could declare a Stage 3 Emergency, the most critical status.
Cal-ISO could direct utilities to "drop load," necessitating involuntary
rolling blackouts for groups of customers across their service areas until
sufficient reserve levels are achieved.


SCE customers are asked to reduce power consumption by turning off any
unneeded electrical appliances and lights, especially during the state's daily
peak consumption period -- noon to 6 p.m.


Following are some effective ways customers can reduce their power use and
not be greatly inconvenienced:


LARGE ENERGY USERS


-- turn off all auxiliary or redundant machinery where possible;


-- consider shifting or staggering operations outside the hours of


highest electrical demand, typically noon to 6 p.m.;


AIR CONDITIONERS


-- set thermostats no lower than 78 degrees (F);


-- use electric fans instead of air conditioning if practical;


-- avoid using evaporative coolers or humidifiers at the same time an


air conditioner is running;


-- avoid cooling unoccupied rooms;


-- open windows during evening hours to take advantage of cool breezes;


APPLIANCES AND TOOLS


-- delay until evening hours the optional use of appliances


(dishwashers, clothes washers and dryers), chargers, power tools, and


electrical equipment;


REFRIGERATORS AND FREEZERS


-- avoid unnecessarily opening refrigerators;


-- keep your refrigerator or freezer set at the proper temperature;


-- be sure to use the "power-saver" switch if your refrigerator has one;


-- keep the condenser coils behind or beneath your refrigerator/freezer


clean (refrigerators represent approximately 25% of the electric bill


for a typical residence);


ADDITIONAL TIPS


-- run swimming pool equipment during early morning and evening hours;


-- limit the reopening of a refrigerator, which is a major user of


electricity in most homes;


-- use drapes and blinds to keep out direct sunlight;


-- replace incandescent light bulbs with ENERGY Star(R) qualified


compact fluorescent bulbs;


-- always wash a full load of clothes or use the variable water level


adjustment for smaller loads; and


-- be sure your home has adequate insulation.

For many Californians, fear of high electricity bills is a bigger threat than 
blackouts

SAN DIEGO (AP) _ Ray Marquez wonders whether he'll have to cut
back on food or gas in order to pay his electricity bill.


The 34-year-old Orange County maintenance man usually pays dlrs
80 a month for power during summer months. Now, he's trying to
figure out how to pay an electricity bill that could push dlrs 130
come June 1.


``Since I got married and had children, you know, I've been
dealing with balancing bills,'' he said Wednesday. ``But if I now
have to pay more for electricity, I'm not going to have money for
gas or food for the kids.''


As Californians coped with rolling blackouts that darkened
thousands of businesses and homes Monday and Tuesday, many
struggled with an even bigger worry: how to pay for soaring energy
costs.


In March, the state Public Utilities Commission approved the
biggest rate increase in California history, up to 46 percent for
customers of Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas &amp; Electric.
Those rate hikes start hitting customers in next month's bill.


Gailen Kyle, who raises alfalfa on 1,600 acres (640 hectares) in
the Mojave Desert, says a 40 percent increase would put his farm
out of business.


``It would end us,'' the third-generation farmer said.
``Everybody here that farms alfalfa would be out of business.''


Kyle, 46, said he has to pump water nearly around the clock from
wells drilled 310 feet (93 meters) below his farm near Lancaster. A
small increase in the price of energy a few months ago added dlrs
80,000 to the dlrs 400,000 annual bill he was already paying.


To save money, Kyle agreed to become an ``interruptible''
customer, meaning he voluntarily allows his power to be shut off
during statewide electricity shortages in exchange for reduced
rates. So far this year, his power has been cut 26 times.


Even before the state utilities commission raised rates,
residents were paying 26 percent more for electricity than the
nationwide average, according to federal statistics. Only customers
in New England, New York, Alaska and Hawaii pay more.


One of the problems is that the wholesale cost of electricity
has risen sharply over the past year but under California's 1996
deregulation law the state's largest utilities, PG&amp;E and SoCal
Edison, have been prevented from passing their costs to customers.
In April, PG&amp;E declared bankruptcy.


The West isn't just facing spiraling costs and a shortage of
supplies, however. Its transmission system is fragmented and
overworked and would take years to improve, power officials told
the region's governors Wednesday.


``There is no immediate solution,'' said Idaho Gov. Dirk
Kempthorne, one of four governors participating in a six-hour,
round-table meeting with industry representatives.


The Western Governors Association was told there is no
established method for paying for transmission upgrades, and market
and regulatory barriers stand in the way. It's not even clear where
new power lines are most needed.


The group, which included the governors of Utah, Idaho, Montana
and Wyoming, has given energy experts until July 15 to recommend
ways to eliminate bottlenecks.


Meanwhile Californians, who've already weathered six days of
rolling blackouts this year, fear they'll soon be paying more for
less service.


The Independent System Operator, which runs the state's power
grid, has forecast more than 30 days of blackouts this summer due
to severe shortages of electric supply.


Dee Ann Hendirx, 53, of San Francisco, has stocked up on candles
and battery-operated clocks.


``I hate to say this but it's getting to be a way of life in
California,'' she said.

Report: Power wholesalers overcharged California $5.5 billion 
DON THOMPSON, Associated Press Writer
Thursday, March 22, 2001 
,2001 Associated Press 
(03-22) 11:41 PST SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Electricity wholesalers have 
overcharged California more than $5 billion since May by manipulating the 
energy market, according to a report prepared for power grid managers. 
The Independent System Operator will file the findings with federal 
regulators and ask for a refund, ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said. 
The state auditor also said Thursday that the state's 1996 deregulation law 
encouraged both buyers and sellers of electricity to ``manipulate wholesale 
prices to their advantage'' by underestimating supply and demand. 
The auditor's report lays out what it calls ``a complex combination'' of 
deficiencies and misjudgments it says led to the state's power problems. 
According to the ISO report, five in-state power suppliers and 16 importers 
frequently offered electricity at prices higher than it cost them to produce 
-- effectively withholding supplies -- or didn't bid at all when they were 
able to generate power. 
ISO Director of Market Analysis Anjali Sheffrin presented the findings at a 
conference in Berkeley last week. 
The companies have denied overcharging California and have said they expect 
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will determine their prices were 
justified. 
The commission has recently stepped up scrutiny of power companies' behavior 
during California's power crisis, asking suppliers to justify $124 million in 
sales during the first two months of the year or refund the money. Critics 
claim thousands of additional questionable sales are not being challenged. 
California has been spending about $45 million a day -- $4.2 billion since 
January -- to purchase power for Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern 
California Edison. Both utilities, the state's largest, have been cut off by 
electricity wholesalers because their credit is almost worthless. 
Edison and PG&E say they are nearly $14 billion in debt due to soaring 
wholesale power costs. The state's deregulation law blocks them from 
recovering the costs from customers. 
State Controller Kathleen Connell said Wednesday that the state's 
power-buying is gutting its budget surplus. 
Since the state started making emergency power buys, the surplus has fallen 
from $8.5 billion to about $3.2 billion, she said. 
Connell ordered an audit of the power buys, saying Gov. Gray Davis is 
withholding key financial information from her office and the Legislature. 
She said she would refuse to transfer $5.6 billion into a ``rainy day fund'' 
she said was set up to impress Wall Street as the state prepares to issue $10 
billion in revenue bonds to cover its power buys. 
Transferring the money would leave the state general fund $2.4 billion in 
debt, Connell said. 
Sandy Harrison, spokesman for the state Department of Finance, and Keely 
Bosler, of the Legislative Analyst's Office, said such transfers are routine 
and required by law. 
``The law says she has to do it. The law does not give her the power to 
demand that kind of audit information,'' Harrison said. 
Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the administration has released the 
financial information it can without jeopardizing negotiations for long-term 
power contracts with wholesalers. 
Also Wednesday, a federal judge ordered a major wholesaler, Reliant Energy 
Services, to continue selling power to California despite its fear that it 
will not be paid. 
The ISO buys power from companies like Reliant on behalf of utilities in 
attempts to fend off rolling blackouts like those that hit the state this 
week and during two days in January.

Reliant To Appeal Fed Judge Ruling To Sell Pwr To Calif

03/22/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) said Thursday it will 
immediately file with the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco in 
response to a federal judge's ruling late Wednesday that the company continue 
selling power to California regardless of whether it is paid. 
U.S. District Court Judge Frank Damrell granted California's Independent 
System Operator, which makes last minute power purchases in the spot market, 
a preliminary injunction against Reliant, saying Californians were at risk of 
irreparable harm if Reliant stopped selling power to the state.
The ISO, manager of the state's electricity grid, said the judge's ruling 
will allow the agency to keep the lights on in California. 
Reliant, which is owed more than $300 million from the state's cash-strapped 
utilities, supplies California with about 3,000 megawatts of electricity from 
power plants it owns in the state. 
Reliant spokesman Richard Wheatley said the state Department of Water 
Resources, the agency that buys California's bulk power needs on behalf of 
PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric, Edison International (EIX) unit 
Southern California Edison and Sempra Energy (SRE) unit San Diego Gas & 
Electric, should back the ISO's last minute power purchases. 
In a filing with the Securities and Commission, Reliant said it is owed $108 
million by the DWR for last minute power purchases the ISO made during the 
six weeks prior to the agreement Reliant made with the DWR. 
Damrell dismissed Reliant's claim, saying he does not have the authority to 
force the DWR to pay for that power. 
"We're going to immediately appeal Judge Damrell's order," Wheatley said. 
"Clearly the judge understands the implications of his order. We are required 
to do business with creditworthy entities. Unfortuantely the judge did not 
force the ISO to post a surety bond, which would allowed us to do business 
with the ISO." 
Gov. Gray Davis has said the state is not responsible for the last minute 
power purchases the ISO makes, despite a law passed authorizing the DWR to 
buy power on behalf of the utilities. 
Wheatley added that the company will also seek relief on the issue at the 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Damrell's ruling remains in effect 
until the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission rules on the matter. 
Separately, Wheatley said a short-term power supply contract that Reliant 
signed with the DWR expired Monday and the DWR has not renewed the contract. 
A spokesman for the DWR would not comment on the issue.

Federal judge orders major power wholesaler to sell to California

Updated: March 21, 2001 - 8:23 p.m. 
A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction Wednesday ordering a major 
electricity wholesaler to continue selling to California despite its fear 
that it will not get paid. 
U.S. District Judge Frank C. Damrell Jr. said Californians were at risk of 
irreparable harm if Reliant Energy Services stopped selling power to the 
Independent System Operator, which oversees the state's power grid. The ISO 
buys last-minute power on behalf of utilities to fill gaps in supply to try 
to fend off blackouts. 
Damrell dismissed Reliant's attempt to force the state Department of Water 
Resources to back the ISO's purchases for the state's two biggest utilities. 
The state has been spending about $50 million a day on power for Pacific Gas 
and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison, both denied credit by 
suppliers after amassing billions of dollars in debts.
The judge said he had no authority to force the DWR to pay for that power. 
Gov. Gray Davis has said the state isn't responsible for purchasing the 
costly last-minute power ISO buys for Edison and PG&E, despite a law 
authorizing state power purchases on the utilities' behalf. 
ISO attorney Charles Robinson said the ruling gives ISO operators "a tool to 
assist them in keeping the lights on in California." 
"Had the decision gone the other way, one could expect other generators to 
simply ignore emergency orders," Robinson said. 
Damrell's preliminary injunction will remain in effect until the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission rules on the matter. 
Damrell denied the ISO's request for preliminary injunctions against three 
other wholesalers, Dynegy, AES and Williams, who agreed to continue selling 
to the ISO pending the FERC ruling. 
Spokesmen for Reliant, Dynegy, AES and Williams were out of the office 
Wednesday night and didn't immediately return calls from The Associated Press 
seeking comment on the ruling. 
The ISO went to court in February after a federal emergency order requiring 
the power sales expired. The judge then issued a temporary restraining order, 
requiring the sales, but dropped it after the suppliers agreed to continue 
sales to California, pending his Wednesday ruling. 
The ISO said it would lose about 3,600 megawatts if the suppliers pulled out, 
enough power for about 2.7 million households. One megawatt is enough for 
roughly 750 homes. 
Grid officials said Reliant's share alone is about 3,000 megawatts. Reliant 
said the amount at issue actually is less than a fourth of that, because most 
of the power is committed under long-term contracts. 
Reliant, which provides about 9 percent of the state's power, worries it 
won't get paid due to the financial troubles of PG&E and Edison. 
PG&E and Edison say that together they have lost about $13 billion since June 
due to soaring wholesale electricity costs that California's 1996 
deregulation law bars them from passing onto customers. 
At the same time, the state has faced a tight electricity supply, due in part 
to California power plant shutdowns for maintenance and to a tight 
hydroelectric supply in the Pacific Northwest. 
Managers of the state power grid imposed rolling blackouts across the state 
Monday and Tuesday as supply fell short of demand. Wednesday, cooling 
temperatures and the completion of repairs at several power plants allowed 
the state to avoid blackouts.
State Controller Kathleen Connell said Wednesday that the energy crunch also 
imperils California's financial health.
Connell said the state's power-buying on behalf of Edison and PG&E is is 
gutting its budget surplus. Since the state started making emergency power 
buys in January, the surplus has fallen from $8.5 billion to about $3.2 
billion, she said. 
Connell ordered an audit of the state's power-buying, saying Davis is 
withholding key financial information from her office and the Legislature. 
She is refusing a request by Davis and the Legislature to transfer $5.6 
billion into a "rainy day fund" she said was set up to impress Wall Street as 
the state prepares to issue $10 billion in revenue bonds to cover its 
power-buying. 
Transferring the money would leave the state general fund $2.4 billion in 
debt, Connell said. 
Sandy Harrison, spokesman for the state Department of Finance, and Keely 
Bosler of the Legislative Analyst's Office, said such transfers are routine 
and required by law. 
They put the state's budget surplus at $5.6 billion. 
"The law says she has to do it. The law does not give her the power to demand 
that kind of audit information," Harrison said. 
He said the state's budget isn't in danger because it will be repaid with the 
$10 billion in long-term debt. 
Wells Fargo & Co. chief economist Sung Won Sohn said he sees little progress 
in efforts to fix the state's power problems and end state electricity 
purchases. 
"If we're going to pour money into a bottomless pit, I would worry about the 
state's finances," he said. "At some point we're going to run out of money."
The controller's criticism of fellow Democrat Davis won support from Assembly 
Republicans and Secretary of State Bill Jones, a Republican considering 
challenging Davis next year. 
Jones said he wants to announce his own plan to solve the state's energy 
woes, but can't unless Davis releases more financial details. 
Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio dismissed the criticism.
"Political grandstanding doesn't generate one more kilowatt of energy for 
California in this time of emergency," he said. 
Maviglio said the administration has released the financial information it 
can without jeopardizing negotiations for long-term power contracts with 
wholesalers. 
Also Wednesday, a report by Davis' chief power negotiator appears to show 
that as much as 75 percent of the state's power purchases will have to be on 
the expensive short-term market this summer, said Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Marina 
del Rey, chairwoman of the Senate Energy Committee. 
"The prices may be phenomenol," she said, particularly given predicted 
hydroelectric shortages due to drought in the Pacific Northwest. 
The report by David Freeman, who is negotiating the state's long-term power 
contracts, shows California has finalized 19 contracts and has 25 agreements 
in principle. Freeman said DWR is continuing to negotiate other contracts.
Bowen said FERC should impose short-term price caps or let generators to 
charge enough to make a reasonable profit "or we could be subject to enormous 
price-gouging this summer."

State falling short on pacts that provide low-cost energy 
Published Thursday, March 22, 2001, in the San Jose Mercury News 
BY CHRIS O'BRIEN AND JOHN WOOLFOLK 

Mercury News 

The state has signed low-cost contracts for just a third of the energy it 
needs this year, raising the prospect that California could be forced to buy 
much of its electricity this summer on the expensive spot market. 
A spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis conceded Wednesday that the state will be in 
trouble without more contracts, but insisted California will meet its needs 
through conservation and additional long-term deals for cheap electricity. 
The state, according to a report released Wednesday, has fallen far short of 
the governor's goal of filling almost all its electricity needs through such 
deals. In fact, the state has lined up contracts for about half the amount 
Davis had projected earlier this month. 
If the state has to rely heavily on the volatile spot market, where the price 
of electricity this summer could reach five times the state's contract price, 
pressure could mount to raise the cap on the electricity rates consumers pay. 
But Steven Maviglio, the governor's spokesman, said, ``The governor has said 
he's committed to work this in the existing rate structure, so that's the 
plan.'' 
In the report sent to state lawmakers, the state Department of Water 
Resources indicated that it had secured just more than 20 million 
megawatt-hours for this year, leaving it far short of the 60 million 
megawatt-hours needed. 
``This is just a progress report,'' Maviglio said. ``They did all this in 
three weeks, which is pretty amazing when you think about it, and we have a 
lot more to do.'' 
The state got into the power buying business in January, supplying it to the 
state's nearly bankrupt utilities. 
The state negotiated long-term contracts with generators to supply that power 
at a reduced rate. Based on the report, the state will pay an average of $68 
per megawatt-hour over the next 10 years -- significantly less than in 
December when prices spiked higher than $300 per megawatt-hour but not as low 
as the $55 Davis hoped to reach. 
Most of this power, however, won't be delivered until 2004. From 2004 to 
2006, the Department of Water Resources estimates, it has enough power under 
contract. Until then, the amount falls short. 
In 2001, it appears the state has about one-third of the power it needs. The 
gap closes to about half in 2002 and two-thirds in 2003. 
At a news conference in Los Angeles two weeks ago, Davis said the state would 
have to buy only 30 to 45 percent of the power it needs this summer on the 
open market. 
At the time, critics said with only two-thirds of the power under contract, a 
rate increase was almost inevitable. Even Davis' chief negotiator, S. David 
Freeman, offered a bleak assessment for the summer, saying that all available 
electricity has already been sold. 
``We'll be subject to extremely high prices,'' said Frank Wolak, a Stanford 
professor who sits on a market committee for the Independent System Operator, 
the agency that runs the state power grid. 
Wolak said there are two main hopes for avoiding a price increase this 
summer: Federal officials could cap the wholesale price, a step they've 
resisted, or Californians can conserve an unprecedented amount of power.

Crisis saps state surplus
POWER CRISIS 
Controller moves to block a transfer of funds, saying the $8.5 billion 
surplus has been cut more than half since January 
By Mike Taugher
TIMES STAFF WRITER 
The energy crisis has bled California's once-touted budget surplus by more 
than half since taxpayers began buying electricity two months ago, leading a 
top state finance official Wednesday to order an audit of the power purchases 
and block Gov. Gray Davis' plan to transfer funds into a reserve account. 
A booming economy last year produced a budget surplus that totaled $8.5 
billion in January. But that figure now stands at about $3.2 billion, 
according to Controller Kathleen Connell. 
"We started this year with a generous budget surplus," Connell said in a 
statement announcing her decision to block what Davis administration 
officials described as a routine transfer of surplus money. "The energy 
crisis has taken much of that away, and this transfer on top of the 
electricity purchases would put the fund at risk." 
Meanwhile, the Davis administration released a report by David Freeman, the 
governor's chief negotiator on power purchases, on the progress of executing 
long-term agreements meant to stabilize the power buys. 
According to the report, only about 40 percent of the electricity needed from 
the open market this year has been lined up. That means the state could be 
forced to continue buying a substantial amount of power on the highly 
expensive spot market and further drain its coffers. 
And a key regulatory panel is scheduled next week to issue a ruling that 
would determine how quickly state funds will be replenished when it decides 
what portion of electric bill payments should be allocated to the state 
treasury, a decision that could include a rate increase to fully repay 
taxpayers without further crippling the state's two largest electric 
utilities. 
The Public Utilities Commission also will consider whether it will force the 
utilities to pay alternative energy producers, whose shutdowns this week 
contributed to blackouts. 
Connell's action underscores a growing nervousness over the sheer volume of 
money that is being poured into energy buys, despite the fact that state 
officials plan to replenish the treasury with up to $10 billion in loans that 
will be repaid by electricity consumers. 
The state has committed to spending $4.2 billion to date to keep lights on 
since taxpayers were forced in mid-January to take over electricity buys from 
the financially crippled utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern 
California Edison. Tax money is going out at a clip of about $50 million a 
day. 
High prices already have brought PG&E and Edison to the brink of bankruptcy, 
and now the state's surplus is at risk, according to Connell. 
In addition to requesting an audit and announcing her intention to delay the 
transfer to the reserve account, Connell said she wanted the administration 
to send her office more information about the electricity purchases. 
Davis' representatives questioned Connell's authority in trying to block the 
funds transfer, which they called a routine accounting procedure, and accused 
her of making political hay. 
"It is not helpful to the taxpayers or ratepayers or the people who just want 
to keep the lights on, it isn't helpful to have the situation muddied like 
this," said Sandy Harrison, a Finance Department spokesperson. "We're sorry 
it came up in this manner." 
Connell and the administration have butted heads in recent weeks. The 
controller wants to post details of the state's electricity purchases on her 
Web site, a plan that have been delayed under pressure from Davis because of 
the governor's concerns that releasing those details will allow power 
generators and traders to sell at higher prices. 
Harrison said administration officials believe Connell lacks the authority 
either to block the funds transfer to a reserve account or to audit the state 
water resources department. 
Two days of widespread blackouts this week show how vulnerable the power grid 
is to financial glitches. Although several factors combined to produce the 
blackouts, state power officials say the outages could have been avoided if 
the utilities were paying their bills to alternative energy producers. 
Many of those producers, including clean-burning natural gas power plants, 
wind, solar and geothermal energy developers, shut down enough production to 
spell the difference between grid reliability and blackouts Monday and 
Tuesday. 
Davis called the utilities' failure to pay bills to those producers, known as 
qualifying facilities, "immoral." The QFs were either unable to buy gas from 
their suppliers or were frustrated with the utilities' failure to pay them. 
"The utilities hoarded billions of dollars since November without paying any 
money out," said Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio. "They've got the money -- 
we're pulling the trigger to make them pay it." 
The utilities, however, say they are doing all they can to conserve enough 
cash to continue operating. Together, they owe the QFs about $1.5 billion. 
Next week, the PUC is scheduled to consider whether to force the utilities to 
heed Davis' demand to pay the QFs, and it might also decide how much of 
ratepayers' bill payments will be used to refund taxpayers for power buys. 
PG&E says that under a formula proposed by the administration, the water 
resources department would receive about 40 percent of the money collected 
from ratepayers for power purchases. 
The rest of that money, about $240 million, would have to be divided among 
QFs, existing power contracts, operating PG&E's nuclear and hydroelectric 
plants, and what hour-by-hour purchases the utility still must make on the 
spot market, according to PG&E spokesman John Nelson. 
"There isn't enough to do that," he said. 
That is making it increasingly likely that electric bills will be hiked, 
according to a growing chorus of officials and experts. 
Unless rates are raised, Nelson said, the only entity that can absorb a lack 
of payment or a partial payment is the state treasury. Cutting off any others 
will lead to electricity becoming unavailable and more blackouts, he said. 
"If they do it under existing rates -- given that the existing pool of money 
is not enough -- who doesn't get paid or who gets a partial payment?" Nelson 
said. "What's the only entity left with wiggle room? The state." 
Rate hikes are also a sticking point in negotiations to bail out the 
utilities through purchase of their transmission lines and other assets, 
Maviglio said. 
"They want rate increases of significant magnitude, and we're not going 
there," he said. 
WE CAN TRIM STORY HERE IF NECESSARY, BUT KEEP TAGLINES AT BOTTOM 
About one-third the electricity needed by the customers of California's three 
major utility companies is produced by the companies themselves, one-third 
comes from alternative producers who use environmentally friendly techniques 
and one-third is bought on the open market. 
The state stepped in to buy the one-third needed from the open market after 
the utility companies ran out of cash and credit in January to make the 
purchases themselves. 
But that electricity has proven to be enormously expensive, and Davis has 
planned to lower those prices by committing to long-term purchases. 
Freeman's report on the progress of those long-term purchases, dated March 15 
but released this week, said the state has finalized 19 contracts with seven 
suppliers and reached 25 additional agreements.

Bill to pay small energy firms stalls
By Kevin Yamamura, Dale Kasler and Jim Sanders
Bee Staff Writers
(Published March 23, 2001) 
A quickly melded proposal that would assure payments for alternative energy 
suppliers whose money woes contributed to power blackouts this week stalled 
Thursday in a divided Legislature. 
The state Senate passed the bill, AB 8x, but with Republicans balking, it was 
rejected in the Assembly along party lines. Assembly leaders said they may 
try again today. 
For most of Thursday, lawmakers scrutinized legislation they had overhauled 
the night before to include Gov. Gray Davis' plan to force utilities to pay 
solar, wind and small gas-fired suppliers. Such providers, called "qualified 
facilities," or QFs, provide more than 20 percent of California's 
electricity, and their shutdowns were partly to blame for rolling blackouts 
Monday and Tuesday. 
Under the Democratic governor's plan, the state Public Utilities Commission 
would determine prices at which alternative generators may sell power, but 
legislation is needed to authorize the PUC action. 
Lawmakers faced time pressures Thursday. They wanted to pass the bill quickly 
so the PUC could act next week and legislators could embark Monday on an 
annual three-day lobbying trip in Washington, D.C. 
Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, D-Sherman Oaks, said the Republicans' 
rejection of AB 8x could jeopardize more than $4 billion the state has spent 
or allocated for electricity during the energy crisis. 
Hertzberg said producers of alternative energy, which are owed more than $1 
billion, have threatened to drag debt-ridden utilities into involuntary 
bankruptcy if the Legislature failed to pass the measure. 
"They said it, and I believe it," Hertzberg said. If such bankruptcies occur, 
he added, the state with its multibillion-dollar debt would become "just 
another creditor in a pile of creditors." 
But Assembly Republican leader Bill Campbell of Villa Park said the 
finger-pointing is unfair. Passage of AB 8x would not necessarily prevent 
bankruptcies, he said. 
One alternative energy provider won a crucial court ruling Thursday that 
staved off, at least for a while, threats by some creditors to haul one or 
both big utilities into bankruptcy court for nonpayment of bills. 
CalEnergy Co. Inc. won the right to sell its geothermal power, which was 
contracted to Southern California Edison, on the open market. CalEnergy said 
it is owed $45 million by Edison. 
If the Imperial County judge hadn't ruled in CalEnergy's favor, the company 
and seven other QFs "were fully prepared" to file an involuntary bankruptcy 
petition against Edison this morning, said David Sokol, chief executive of 
CalEnergy's parent, MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co. of Des Moines, Iowa. 
"That is currently off the table." 
An involuntary bankruptcy proceeding would take California's energy crisis 
into uncharted territory, although a bankruptcy judge would have the leeway 
to reject the filing. 
Freed from its contract with Edison, CalEnergy will move to sell its 
electricity "to people who will pay for it," Sokol said. 
Besides calming the bankruptcy movement temporarily, the ruling also could 
prompt other alternative energy providers -- hundreds of which have shut down 
because of nonpayment by Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co. -- to follow 
CalEnergy's example and find other buyers for their electricity, said Gary 
Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum, an association of generators. 
Assembly Republicans said they felt the Senate's decision to package three 
important energy issues into a single bill was an attempt to ramrod 
legislation through both houses. 
"We have to stand and say no," Campbell said during floor debate. 
Besides determining alternative generator payments, the bill would change an 
earlier law by capping the value of bonds the state may sell for power 
purchases at $10 billion. It also would extend to large businesses an 
existing rate cap in the San Diego Gas and Electric Co. service area. 
And it would earmark a portion of rates paid by utility customers to fund the 
state's ongoing power purchases. Within a week, the state will have spent 
$4.2 billion on power since January. 
Without the bill, some legislators fear, Pacific Gas and Electric and 
Southern California Edison would be reimbursed before the state. 
"They have got (some) gall to go to the PUC and say they're going to go to 
court to keep our money -- to keep our money to pay off their creditors," 
said Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco. 
Most of the bill's controversy, however, centered on how the PUC would treat 
gas-fired alternative generators. 
The commission issued a revised draft decision Wednesday that would impose 
prices for qualifying facilities at $79 a megawatt-hour for five-year 
contracts or $69 a megawatt-hour for 10 years. 
But those producers that use natural gas -- representing about two-thirds of 
the alternative energy providers in California -- spent Thursday arguing that 
Davis' plan to rescue them would all but guarantee that they would go out of 
business instead. 
The plan -- ordering Edison and PG&E to pay them a fixed price for their 
power -- would set rates well below the cost of natural gas, they said. 
Democratic lawmakers tried to assure such producers that the PUC would set 
prices that make business sense, even obtaining a letter to that effect from 
Loretta Lynch, who heads the commission. 
Davis has vowed to fine Edison and PG&E if they don't pay alternative 
producers for future deliveries. But Sokol said his company isn't convinced 
that Edison will pay. 
Calling Edison a "confrontive, in-your-face, nasty organization," Sokol said 
the utility was "sitting on $2 billion" and not paying its bills. Edison, in 
a Securities and Exchange Commission filing Thursday, said its debts outweigh 
its cash reserves by $722 million. 
The Senate sent the Assembly two other bills that deal specifically with 
supply and demand. The first, SB 5x, would spend about $1 billion on energy 
conservation and low-income assistance programs. The other, SB 28x, would 
streamline siting procedures for power plant construction. 
In separate energy-related matters Thursday, the Assembly approved: 
AB 21x, which would allow businesses, industries or other electrical 
customers to negotiate private contracts with energy providers. 
Nine energy bills designed to generate or save 665 megawatts of electricity 
-- including 345 megawatts this summer. One megawatt is enough electricity to 
light about 1,000 homes. 
The state put power emergencies behind it, after dropping out of a Stage 1 
alert late Wednesday. The California Independent System Operator, which 
manages the state's power transmission grid, was predicting no further alerts 
this week. It expected cooling temperatures and a regular dropoff in 
electricity use on Fridays to lessen demand, at the same time that more power 
plants were returning to service.

House panel ends energy hearings -- will it step in?
By David Whitney
Bee Washington Bureau
(Published March 23, 2001) 
WASHINGTON -- A key House panel wrapped up a series of hearings on the 
California electricity crisis Thursday and now will decide whether to come to 
the state's aid with legislation. 
But the panel's Texas chairman made clear that West Coast price controls 
won't be on the table. 
"Caps will not be in anything I am submitting," said Rep. Joe Barton, 
chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee's energy and air quality 
subcommittee. 
Some form of federal controls to hold down escalating wholesale prices this 
summer because of power shortages has been the most frequent appeal of 
witnesses who testified before the panel during roughly 30 hours of hearings 
over five days. 
Such controls have been sought by the governors of California, Oregon and 
Washington. As power shortages are forecast for other regions, states like 
New York also have appealed for temporary price controls to halt gouging. 
But the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which is responsible for 
enforcing reasonable wholesale rates under the Federal Power Act, has refused 
to impose them, and the Bush administration is bolstering that decision by 
opposing any legislation that would compel such action. 
Barton, in a brief hallway interview, declined to say what other legislative 
remedies he might propose to address the worsening California situation. 
He said he expects to submit a list of ideas to the White House today, and 
after receiving comment on it, sit down with other committee Republicans and 
Democrats next week to see if any legislation is in order. 
"If we are going to do anything to help California or the West this summer, 
we have to make it law within the next month or six weeks," Barton said. 
Even the panel's senior Democrat, Virginia Rep. Rick Boucher, was urging a 
"careful and deliberate approach" to the California crisis, which he said was 
largely of the state's own making. 
There are steps Congress might take to provide some help to the West, such as 
more money for conservation and relaxed federal regulation of air quality 
standards. That would permit older, more polluting generators to operate 
through a long, hot summer when electricity demand could exceed supply by 
about 3,000 megawatts, roughly the amount needed to power 3 million homes. 
But Alan Lloyd, chairman of the California Air Resources Board, said power 
production already is being maximized without sacrificing air quality. 
"Simply put, no essential electricity generation has been curtailed due to 
air emission limitations," he said. "California's programs to protect public 
health are not major factors in the electricity shortages experienced to 
date." 
The concern is that as shortages turn into more rolling blackouts, wholesale 
prices will jump even higher and steadily bleed the economies of California 
and the West Coast. 
William L. Massey, the lone member of the energy regulatory commission who 
supports price controls, said at a Tuesday hearing that without them the West 
Coast faces economic catastrophe this summer. 
It was evident from the comments of some Republicans that they think their 
party could capitalize politically from a difficult summer. 
"If they had a bad summer, it could show up in the polls," said Rep. Charlie 
Norwood, R-Ga. "And sometimes that's not a bad idea." 
One of the most dramatic exchanges during the weeklong hearings came Thursday 
with S. David Freeman, the former general manager of the Sacramento Municipal 
Utility District who now heads the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. 
He recently was named Gov. Gray Davis' chief negotiator with power generators 
for long-term contracts to stabilize future deliveries. 
"Don't feel sorry for California," Freeman said. "We're going to come out of 
this stronger than ever." 
But Freeman said it will be a year or two before all the fixes are in place, 
and in the meantime the region desperately needs Congress' help to force the 
FERC into controlling wholesale prices, which witnesses said are likely to 
rise from $7 billion last year to as much as $70 billion or more this year. 
"We recognize that the current administration and various legislators have 
their own opinion as to the California situation," Freeman said. "But my 
personal plea is that if the federal government is not going to help us, the 
least it should do is refrain from legislation that attempts to tell us what 
to do." 
Barton perked up at that idea. 
"Leave California alone, huh?" Barton said. "That might be a good motto."

Dan Walters: Crisis deepens: politicos panic


(Published March 23, 2001) 
That choking sound you hear is California's political class shifting into 
near-panic mode as it realizes that the energy crisis is on the verge of 
becoming a full-scale meltdown, with utilities forced into bankruptcy and 
consumers hammered by severe and prolonged power blackouts and soaring 
electricity bills. 
The Legislature, which had been content to allow Gov. Gray Davis to handle 
the crisis on his own, suddenly came to life Thursday, jolted by this week's 
unexpected rolling blackouts and threats by creditors to force the utilities 
into bankruptcy court. Lawmakers quickly fashioned a basketful of legislation 
aimed -- or so they hope -- at increasing power supplies, promoting 
conservation and relieving the financial pressure on utilities and 
electricity generators. But it may be too little, too late -- and Davis and 
other politicians are already pointing fingers of blame, aware that a 
political price will be paid if the apocalypse strikes. 
While Davis chants his mantra that he inherited a fatally flawed utility 
deregulation scheme from predecessor Pete Wilson, Republicans are blaming 
Davis for moving too slowly after the crisis first surfaced last summer, and 
even some of Davis' fellow Democrats are distancing themselves from the 
governor. 
"Deregulation was a product of a Republican governor, a Republican author and 
a Republican PUC (Public Utilities Commission) that was unduly impatient," 
Davis said at one point this week as the Capitol buzzed with private 
negotiations and public posturing. 
A day later, however, state Controller Kathleen Connell, a Democrat, issued a 
warning that Davis' power purchases, running at $50 million a day, had 
already drawn down state budget reserves by nearly two-thirds, and she 
refused to authorize additional transfers. It was a direct shot by Connell at 
Davis, an old rival, and came just a day after the governor had endorsed a 
Connell foe, Antonio Villaraigosa, in the duel for mayor of Los Angeles. 
Other Democrats didn't join Connell's direct challenge to Davis, but there 
is, nevertheless, a growing concern among Democratic legislators that the 
power purchases are costing many billions of dollars more than the governor 
had projected and could place the state budget in jeopardy. They're nervous 
because Davis has refused to reveal, even to legislators, exactly how much 
power the state is buying each day and how much it is paying. 
From the few details that have been disclosed, it's clear that the state is 
spending about $1.5 billion a month, which would wipe out the state's 
reserves by midsummer. It's also becoming increasingly clear that Davis 
probably can't make good on his promise to avoid major consumer rate 
increases, unless the state is willing to plunge deeply and semi-permanently 
into debt to underwrite wholesale costs, or unless federal authorities order 
huge refunds from power suppliers. 
Rates in areas served by private utilities have risen only slightly while the 
costs, first to utilities and later to the state, soared. Data from the 
administration and utilities, when collated, indicate that the state is in 
line to collect just 20 cents for every dollar it's spending on power 
purchases, and the gap will increase as summer heat drives up demand. 
Privately, some economists say that private utility rates will have to rise 
33 percent to 50 percent to cover costs of current power supplies, plus 
utilities' past debts to generators and the state's purchase of the 
utilities' transmission system, if that deal is made final. 
"It's ultimately going to break down, and the ratepayer is going to pay for 
it one way or the other," Republican Sen. Jim Battin said during one of 
Thursday's many committee hearings on utility legislation. No one disagreed 
with him.

Report says power wholesalers overcharged state $6 billion 



By Don Thompson
ASSOCIATED PRESS 
March 22, 2001 
SACRAMENTO ) Electricity wholesalers have overcharged California more than 
$6.2 billion by manipulating the energy market, according to a report by an 
economist working for power grid managers. 
The Independent System Operator planned to file the findings with federal 
regulators Thursday, and ask for a refund, said ISO spokesman Patrick 
Dorinson. 
In a related development, the state auditor said Thursday that the state's 
1996 deregulation law encouraged both buyers and sellers of electricity to 
"manipulate wholesale prices to their advantage" by underestimating both 
supply and demand.

Outages darken economic outlook in state, some say 
Out-of-state generators question power regulators' authority 
Allegheny Energy makes big California connection 
Enron stock slides despite earnings reassurance 
California's electricity crisis at-a-glance 
? 



The auditor's report lays out what it calls "a complex combination" of 
deficiencies and misjudgments it says led to the state's power problems. 
The ISO's filing came a day after the state controller complained that a 
relentless energy crisis is jeopardizing California's financial future. 
Since May, the companies manipulated the market by bidding at excessive 
prices, effectively withholding supplies or by not bidding at all when they 
had generation capability available, according to the ISO study. 
ISO Director of Market Analysis Anjali Sheffrin presented the findings at an 
energy conference at the University of California, Berkeley, last week. 
The companies have denied overcharging California and have said they expect 
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will determine their prices were 
justified. 
In a burst of activity after weeks of delay, both houses of the Legislature 
approved bills Thursday designed to ease the energy crisis. 
The state Senate approved measures to encourage energy conservation and speed 
up power plant construction. 
Topping that, the Assembly sent the Senate 14 energy-related bills, including 
$455 million in loans and grants to encourage energy efficiency and 
conservation and alternative energy projects by this summer. 
One of the Assembly bills would require new energy plants approved by the 
state to sell their power within California before they offer it to other 
states. 
"The (California) Energy Commission says for every day we delay this bill 
there are 20 megawatts that could be saved that we're not saving," said state 
Sen. Byron Sher, D-Stanford, as senators voted 28-10 to send his conservation 
measure to the Assembly. 
Senators also approved another Sher bill speeding up the siting of power 
plants. It went to the Assembly on a 37-1 vote. 
Meanwhile, a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction Wednesday ordering 
one of the companies named in the ISO filing, Reliant Energy Services, to 
continue selling to California despite its fear that it will not be paid. 
U.S. District Judge Frank C. Damrell Jr. said Californians were at risk of 
irreparable harm if Reliant stopped selling power to the ISO, which buys at 
the last minute on behalf of utilities to bolster supplies and try to fend 
off blackouts. 
Such blackouts struck the state twice this week, shutting off power to 
hundreds of thousands of people from San Diego to Oregon, snarling traffic 
and shutting down businesses. 
The state remained free of any power alerts Thursday morning, as power 
reserves stayed above 7 percent. 
Damrell dismissed Reliant's attempt to force the state Department of Water 
Resources to back the ISO's purchases for the state's two biggest utilities, 
Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co. 
The judge said he had no authority to force the DWR to pay for that power. 
The utilities have been denied credit after amassing billions of dollars in 
debt paying high prices for power that the state's energy deregulation law 
prevents them from passing on to consumers. 
Gov. Gray Davis has said the state isn't responsible for purchasing the 
costly last-minute power the ISO buys for Edison and PG&E, despite a law 
authorizing state power purchases on the utilities' behalf. 
ISO attorney Charles Robinson said the ruling gives ISO operators "a tool to 
assist them in keeping the lights on in California." 
"Had the decision gone the other way, one could expect other generators to 
simply ignore emergency orders," Robinson said. 
Damrell's preliminary injunction will remain in effect until the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission rules on the matter. 
In another development Wednesday, state Controller Kathleen Connell 
complained that the energy crunch is imperiling California's financial 
health. 
Connell said the state's power buying on behalf of Edison and PG&E is gutting 
its budget surplus. Since the state started making emergency power buys in 
January, the surplus has fallen from $8.5 billion to about $3.2 billion, she 
said. 
Connell ordered an audit of the state's power buying, saying Davis is 
withholding key financial information from her office and the Legislature. 
She is also refusing a request by Davis and the Legislature to transfer $5.6 
billion into a "rainy day fund" she said was set up to impress Wall Street as 
the state prepares to issue $10 billion in revenue bonds to cover its power 
buying. 
Transferring the money would leave the state general fund $2.4 billion in 
debt, Connell said. 
Sandy Harrison, spokesman for the state Department of Finance, and Keely 
Bosler of the Legislative Analyst's Office, said such transfers are routine 
and required by law. 
They put the state's budget surplus at $5.6 billion. 
Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio dismissed the criticism. 
"Political grandstanding doesn't generate one more kilowatt of energy for 
California in this time of emergency," he said. 
Connell is a candidate for mayor of Los Angeles in next month's election. 
The ISO study, meanwhile, covered five major in-state power suppliers ) 
Reliant, Dynegy, Williams/AES, Duke Energy and Mirant, as well as 16 power 
importers. All deliver power to customers of Edison, PG&E and San Diego Gas & 
Electric Co., the state's three largest investor-owned utilities. 
"All overcharged, but some excessively and some by moderate amounts," said 
ISO's Sheffrin. 
According to the report, the overcharging took place beginning last May, when 
the energy crisis began, and continued through last month. 
During that time, according to the report, energy suppliers commonly offered 
their electricity at twice the amount it cost them to produce. 
FERC member William L. Massey said he wasn't shocked to hear the amount 
overcharged added up to more than $5 billion. 
"Prices over the past 10 months in California have greatly exceeded the 
federal standards of just and reasonable prices, and I think they have 
exceeded the standards by possibly billions of dollars," he said. 
Chuck Griffin, spokesman for Atlanta-based Mirant said the company would 
justify their charges to FERC officials. 
"I think we're missing sometimes just how basic the problem is in California. 
Supply and demand are out of whack and some basic rules of economics kick in 
when that happens," he said.

Disappearing state surplus sparks alarm 



Controller puts hold on transfer of $5.6 billion to reserve funds
By Karen Kucher and Ed Mendel 
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITERS 
March 22, 2001 
The state's general fund surplus has dropped to $3.2 billion from $8.5 
billion since January largely because California's power purchases are 
devouring the money, state controller Kathleen Connell said yesterday. 
Connell said she wants to see more documentation about state power spending 
before approving the transfer of $5.6 billion from the general fund to a 
special reserve fund requested by Gov. Gray Davis. 
Connell said the state would have to borrow $2.4 billion to cover the 
transfer.

"We started this year with a generous budget surplus. The energy crisis has 
taken much of that away, and this transfer on top of the electricity 
purchases would put the (general) fund at risk," Connell said in a statement. 
Her action came on a day when state power supplies improved. After two days 
of forced outages this week, no rolling blackouts were ordered yesterday. 
Several power plants came back on line and imports from the Pacific Northwest 
provided enough electricity to meet demand yesterday, said Stephanie 
McCorkle, a spokeswoman with the California Independent System Operator, 
which manages most of the state's power grid. 
"Gradually more (electricity) generation comes on every day," McCorkle said. 
"By Monday, we should see somewhere around 2,200 megawatts back in service 
that was not on this Monday. That's if no other generation falls off." 
Meanwhile, Connell's move took some by surprise. 
A spokesman for the state Department of Finance said Connell is denying a 
routine transfer that is required by law. "It was just a routine accounting 
measure that we didn't anticipate becoming controversial," Sandy Harrison 
said. 
Connell announced the denial of the transfer a day after Davis endorsed one 
of her opponents, former Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa, in the race 
for Los Angeles mayor. 
Connell, who monitors California's cash flow, said she was "deeply concerned 
about putting the state's general fund in a deficit situation in light of the 
energy crisis." 
About two months ago, the state began spending about $50 million a day to buy 
power after Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison nearly 
went bankrupt. It is also purchasing power for customers of San Diego Gas and 
Electric. 
The Davis administration said earlier this week it soon will begin spending 
an additional $500 million on power purchases, bringing the total to $4.2 
billion. 
As that staggering sum continues to grow, the state won a court battle with 
an electricity supplier yesterday. A federal judge in Sacramento sided with 
the state and ordered the wholesaler to continue selling to California 
despite its fear that it will not get paid. 
Judge Frank C. Damrell Jr. said Californians were at risk of irreparable harm 
if Reliant Energy Services stopped selling power to the Independent System 
Operator. The ISO acquires last-minute power on behalf of utilities to fill 
gaps in supply to try to fend off blackouts. 
Damrell dismissed Reliant's attempt to force the state Department of Water 
Resources to back the ISO's purchases for the state's two biggest utilities. 
The judge said he had no authority to force the DWR to pay for the power. 
Davis has said the state isn't responsible for purchasing the costly 
last-minute power the ISO buys for Edison and PG&E, despite a law authorizing 
state power purchases on the utilities' behalf. 
Meanwhile, those who manage the power grid say the forecast for power 
supplies this week looks good, although conditions can change quickly. 
ISO managers continue to stress the importance of conservation. Utility 
customers across the state conserved about 900 megawatts of power Tuesday, 
which kept blackouts from being ordered that night. 
As the power crisis worsened this week, ISO managers wished aloud that they 
still could rely on business customers to shut down in exchange for lower 
energy rates. 
Such "interruptible" customers saved as much as 2,100 megawatts last spring, 
a figure that dropped to about 1,700 last summer and 1,400 at the end of the 
year. But in January, the state Public Utilities Commission told utilities 
they could no longer impose fines on business customers who refuse to shut 
down when asked. 
ISO managers realize the program was harming businesses with frequent 
interruptions of service -- but they still miss having that option, McCorkle 
said. 
"It would have made an enormous difference, but at the same time we 
understand the impact it was having on businesses," McCorkle said.

Outages darken economic outlook in state, some say 



By Dean Calbreath?
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER 
March 22, 2001 
Until this week, the San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce was predicting 
that the county was well-insulated from the growing threat of economic 
recession. 
But that was before the lights went out in the chamber's downtown 
headquarters Monday. 
Working by window light in his darkened office, chamber economist Kelly 
Cunningham rapidly erased his previous projections for 3.5 percent growth for 
San Diego County. Cunningham now feels the local economy could fall into a 
recession thanks to its shaky supply of energy.

"Blackouts are very disruptive to the economy," Cunningham said. "A business 
can absorb rising energy prices by cutting costs or raising its own prices. 
But an energy shutoff is much less predictable. It cuts into productivity." 
Those sentiments are being echoed throughout California, as business leaders 
and economists worry that rolling blackouts will darken the state's 
previously glowing economy. 
At the University of California Los Angeles, for instance, leading financial 
theorists will meet April 4 to discuss the question "Can California grow in 
the dark?" Although the topic was chosen before the recent string of power 
outages, the blackouts have given the issue new urgency. 
"These blackouts are not just a single episode," said UCLA economist Tom 
Lieser. "They are a bridge to what will happen this summer. If we don't fall 
into a recession in the second half of the year, we will fall pretty close." 
Tapan Munroe, an economist formerly with Pacific Gas and Electric, this week 
crossed out his projection for 2 percent statewide growth. After blackouts 
rolled toward his consulting offices in the Bay Area city of Moraga, Munroe 
decided the state will be lucky if it manages zero growth. 
"I'm a pretty optimistic guy by nature, but this has been sobering," Munroe 
said. "On Tuesday, one restaurant alone in San Francisco lost $20,000. 
Multiply that by all of the businesses that lost power in the state and 
you've got a serious problem." 
Two days of blackouts in San Diego County have hurt businesses large and 
small. Among the industries under threat is the local biotechnology sector, 
which requires a steady supply of electricity to power areas of laboratories 
that must remain temperature-controlled and sterile. 
Continued blackouts "could have a huge impact, not only in dollars, but 
multiple millions of dollars," said Tom Oster, vice president of operations 
for BioCom, the leading trade organization for the more than 200 biotechs in 
San Diego County. 
Idun Pharmaceuticals, a biotech near La Jolla Village Drive that has 67 
employees, had its power cut for about 40 minutes Tuesday. Though the company 
has a back-up generator, some segments of its laboratories and lab equipment 
were not supported by it. Chemists also had to turn off some sensitive lab 
equipment to avoid the possibility of a damaging power surge once the 
blackout was over. 
"We're not in a position as a small company to back up the whole facility," 
said Steven Mento, Idun's chief executive. "We haven't done a survey yet to 
determine whether we had losses, either in experiments or equipment damaged 
-- but we're hoping because the blackout was so short that damage will be 
minimal." 
Mento said rolling blackouts, coupled with continuing high energy costs, 
could cripple many small biotechs -- and even take a bite out of bigger, more 
established companies. 
"We generate new compounds in controlled environments on a daily basis, and 
when power goes off you can lose samples because of contamination and other 
issues," Mento said. "We are fortunate that our losses would be in having to 
repeat an experiment -- but this could be really critical for companies with 
drug manufacturing and issues of quality control." 
The wireless firms along Sorrento Valley have not been immune from blackouts. 
The lights went out at Qualcomm early this week, although executives declined 
to comment about the impact. 
No blackouts hit the big shipbuilding operations on the waterfront this week. 
But the National Steel and Shipbuilding Co. -- one of San Diego's largest 
employers -- already experienced a voluntary loss of power this year, its 
first since World War II. Since the shipyard does not have its own power 
supply, NASSCO executives fear the effect of unplanned outages. 
"Our average payroll totals half a million dollars a day," said NASSCO 
spokesman Jim Scott. "When you have a day's work disrupted, that can be 
pretty serious. We're currently in discussions about the possibility of 
buying from independent power suppliers, or setting up a power plant of our 
own." 
Small businesses, which constitute the bulk of employment in San Diego 
County, were hurt by disruptions as well -- costing them vital revenue at a 
time when their power bills have skyrocketed. 
At Fantastic Sam's, a hair salon in Chula Vista, Angelica Alcala estimated 
that business dropped 60 percent when the blackouts hit Tuesday. Among other 
things, Alcala had to alter her planned haircuts because she was relying on 
scissors instead of electric clippers. 
At the Family Fun Center in El Cajon, the management gave vouchers or refunds 
to the 15 or so video-game players who were in the midst of killing aliens or 
fighting ninja warriors as the power went down. 
Papa John's Pizza estimates that it may have lost several thousand dollars in 
business after six stores were blacked out Monday and four others lost power 
Tuesday. Brian Mills, who runs 23 Papa John's stores in the county, said his 
main concern was shutting down the computers so they would not be damaged by 
a power surge when the electricity was restored. 
Paul Ecke III, a member of the West Coast advisory panel for the Federal 
Reserve, said the potential impact of the energy crisis "is worse than any 
downturn in the stock market." 
Ecke, who runs the Paul Ecke Ranch flower operation in Encinitas, said the 
crisis could be particularly harmful for the state's agricultural sector, 
since farmers need electricity to pump water and natural gas to heat 
greenhouses. 
"What I'm really worried about is the energy thing is going to cast a shadow 
on California," he said. "If you're a business person thinking about moving 
to California right now, you're probably not going to do it because you're 
not sure you're going to have your lights on this summer." 
Besides the disruption to businesses, the energy crisis is also hurting the 
pocketbooks of hourly workers who have been sent home during the crisis. 
Under state law, employers are free to send hourly workers home without pay 
during such emergencies, although salaried workers must still be paid. 
Susan Kemp, an attorney with the California Chamber of Commerce, said there 
are ways of minimizing the impact on hourly workers. 
"You have to look at what time it is when the blackout occurs and how long 
you think it's going to last," Kemp said. "If it's around a meal time, you 
might send the workers out for a longer meal period if you think it's going 
to be an hour or hour and a half delay." 
But the potential for losing wages doesn't sit well with the hourly workers. 
"When you get sent home early and lose your wages, you have even less money 
to pay your inflated energy bills," said an hourly worker who was sent home 
during Monday's blackout.

Out-of-state generators question power regulators' authority 



By Karen Gaudette
ASSOCIATED PRESS 
March 22, 2001 
SAN FRANCISCO ) At least three major out-of-state electricity generators are 
challenging the authority of the California Public Utilities Commission to 
investigate whether they deliberately reduced power supplies to drive up 
prices. 
The PUC has asked for power plant maintenance records as it tries to 
determine whether Duke Energy, Dynegy Inc., Mirant Corp. and other 
wholesalers have manipulated the energy market at California's expense. 
At issue is who ultimately controls oversight of in-state plants that provide 
most of California's electricity. The plants, once owned by the state's 
largest utilities, were sold off as part of the state's 1996 attempt at 
deregulation. 








Report says power wholesalers overcharged California $5.5 billion 
Disappearing state surplus sparks alarm 
Outages darken economic outlook in state, some say 
Allegheny Energy makes big California connection 
Enron stock slides despite earnings reassurance 
California's electricity crisis at-a-glance 
? 



PUC President Loretta Lynch said the public deserves to know whether 
generators have unnecessarily taken plants off-line to create artificial 
shortages, forcing the utilities and now state bureaucrats to buy much higher 
priced power on the spot energy market. 
"What I do know is we have historically high levels of outages across the 
board," Lynch told The Associated Press. "Dynegy and Duke have been fighting 
the PUC in the PUC's quest to obtain documents about these outages." 
The PUC has the authority to regulate facilities within its borders, she 
added. "It doesn't matter where the headquarters of the company is." 
Duke, based in North Carolina, says it does matter ) and that since it and 
other wholesalers aren't headquartered in California, the PUC can't require 
it to turn over the maintenance records. 
"We have not given them proprietary information because they do not regulate 
us," said Duke's spokesman, Tom Williams. 
Dynegy did not return calls for comment Wednesday. 
The PUC also faces a new challenge in the legislature. A bill sponsored by 
Assemblywoman Carole Migden, D-San Francisco, which would have granted the 
PUC greater inspection authority over out-of-state generators, was amended 
this month to grant the authority to Independent System Operator instead. 
The ISO has managed the delivery of energy through most of the state's power 
grid but historically has done little regulating and has had no policing 
authority. 
This board, created during the state's 1996 attempt at deregulation, was 
redesigned in January. Now it has a five-member board appointed by Davis, 
replacing a 26-member ISO board composed of utility executives, marketers, 
power plant owners and others. 
The latest version of Migden's bill requires wholesalers to report monthly to 
the ISO about any plants that are off-line or working at reduced capacity, 
and gives the ISO power to audit these reports. 
But because the ISO board historically has made key decisions behind closed 
doors and is exempt from certain open-government regulations, government 
watchdogs are outraged by the switch. 
"The PUC's been no friend of ratepayers, but at least under the constitution 
and state law they're required to conduct their process in the open and the 
public can intervene," said Harvey Rosenfield of the Foundation for Taxpayer 
and Consumer Rights. 
Davis ordered last month that the ISO take the lead among state agencies to 
ensure adequate energy supplies. Alan LoFaso, an aide to Migden, said the 
amendment follows Davis' lead. 
Both LoFaso and the governor's spokesman, Steve Maviglio, downplayed the 
change. "I don't know if we have a preference" as to which state agency gets 
the authority to continue the probe, Maviglio said. 
The challenge by Duke Energy, Houston-based Dynegy Inc. and Mirant Corp. of 
Atlanta came in filings March 12 asking for a rehearing of the PUC's February 
resolution reasserting its legal authority to "examine the books, accounts, 
memoranda, contracts and records" of generators selling energy to utilities 
already subject to PUC regulation. 
Those utilities include Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California 
Edison Co., which have been nearly bankrupted buying power from wholesalers, 
as well as the financially troubled San Diego Gas and Electric

Allegheny Energy makes big California connection 



ASSOCIATED PRESS 
March 22, 2001 
HAGERSTOWN, Md. ) Allegheny Energy Inc. said Thursday it has agreed to sell 
$4.5 billion worth of power to California's electricity-purchasing agency 
over the next 10 years. 
The company said the contract call for Allegheny to provide up to 1,000 
megawatts that the Hagerstown-based company has secured from western 
generating plants through its new energy trading division, Allegheny Energy 
Global Markets ) formerly Merrill Lynch Global Energy Markets. 
"This is a win-win for both the state of California and Allegheny Energy. It 
provides a long-term source of fixed-price energy and should help to 
stabilize prices in California," said Michael P. Morrell, president of the 
Allegheny Energy Supply division.

Judge Frees Small Firm From Edison Contract 

By KEN ELLINGWOOD and DAN MORAIN, Times Staff Writers 

?????EL CENTRO--California's balance of electrical power shifted slightly 
Thursday when an Imperial County judge temporarily freed a small geothermal 
energy producer from its contract with Southern California Edison, allowing 
it to sell power on the open market.
?????The ruling by Superior Court Judge Donal B. Donnelly could lead to a 
mass exodus by hundreds of small energy producers that have been selling 
power to the state's financially troubled utilities for months without 
getting paid.
?????At the same time, it may have staved off plans by a group of the small 
generators to send Edison into involuntary bankruptcy as early as today.
?????In Sacramento, energy legislation pushed by Gov. Gray Davis passed in 
the state Senate but foundered in the Assembly. The measure was intended to 
ensure that the state gets repaid for the electricity that it has been buying 
on behalf of Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric, which say they lack the cash 
and credit to purchase power. The bill also was supposed to guarantee that 
the small, alternative energy producers--which together provide nearly a 
third of the state's power--get paid. But Assembly Republicans opposed it, 
saying it hadn't been given sufficient scrutiny.
?????The impact of the small producers was made clear in Imperial County, 
where Edison's failure to pay CalEnergy, the county's biggest property 
taxpayer, had outsize implications. CalEnergy had put county officials on 
notice that it was about to miss a $3.8-million property tax payment. The 
uncertainty had prompted the tiny Calipatria Unified School District to 
postpone a bond issue for badly needed school repairs.
?????Among CalEnergy Chairman David Sokol's first acts after the judge's 
ruling Thursday was to promise Imperial County Supervisor Wally J. Leimgruber 
that the company would pay its property taxes on time.
?????"That is great news," Leimgruber said.
?????Within hours of its court victory, CalEnergy had stopped transmitting 
geothermal power to Edison and begun selling it to El Paso Energy, a 
marketing company that purchased the energy at prevailing rates and resold it 
on the spot market.
?????Some of the more than 700 other small energy producers in the state said 
they were considering similar action against Edison and Pacific Gas & 
Electric.
?????"We absolutely need the right to sell to third parties," said Dean 
Vanech, president of Delta Power, a New Jersey company that owns five small 
gas-fired plants in California and is owed tens of millions of dollars by 
Edison.
?????Sokol praised the Imperial County judge and said his company simply 
wanted the authority to sell its power "to a credit-worthy company that, in 
fact, pays for the power."
?????An Edison spokesman said the company was disappointed with the ruling, 
but sympathized with CalEnergy and other small producers because 
"California's power crisis has placed [them] in financial distress, just as 
it has placed utilities in financial distress."
?????Edison expressed concern that the ruling would prompt CalEnergy and 
other small producers to sell their power out of state. Sokol said CalEnergy 
had specifically told El Paso Energy that it hoped its power would remain in 
California, "but if someone wants to pay a higher price out of state, we 
can't stop them."
?????Sokol said that Edison still owes CalEnergy $140 million and that the 
company--along with seven other small producers--had been prepared to file a 
petition in federal bankruptcy court in Los Angeles today forcing the utility 
into involuntary bankruptcy. He said his company no longer intends to do so, 
and he believed--but wasn't certain--that the other companies would shelve 
their plans.
?????Edison filed papers Thursday with the federal Securities and Exchange 
Commission showing that it owed $840 million to various small electricity 
producers, many of which rely on renewable energy sources such as geothermal 
steam, solar energy or wind.
?????The alternative energy producers--and utilities--strenuously objected to 
the legislation considered in Sacramento on Thursday. The bill, spelling out 
how the utilities are to pay the state and the small producers, passed the 
Senate on a 27-9 vote, the exact two-thirds margin required. But it stalled 
in the Assembly on a 46-23 party-line vote, well short of two-thirds.
?????"When I was a citizen back in Lancaster, I heard these stories about 
pieces of legislation that were cooked up late at night, that . . . were cut 
and pasted together and were rammed through by the Legislature," Assemblyman 
George Runner (R-Lancaster) said. "That's exactly what we have before us."
?????The alternative electricity generators, including oil companies, warned 
that they would lose money under the Davis proposal, while representatives of 
Edison and PG&E, which have amassed billions in debt in the worsening energy 
crisis, said the legislation would push them deeper into the hole.
?????"There isn't enough money," Edison attorney Ann Cohn testified at a 
Senate hearing on the bill Thursday. "It is a very simple question: Dollars 
going out cannot be greater than dollars coming in."
?????The bill, AB 8X, combined several proposals. First, it sought to clarify 
earlier legislation by spelling out that Edison and PG&E must pay the state 
all money collected from consumers for electricity that the state has been 
buying.
?????Additionally, the bill would turn over to the California Public 
Utilities Commission the thorny issue of how much to pay alternative energy 
producers for their electricity.
?????Wind, solar and geothermal producers might agree to the prices offered 
by the administration. But most of the alternative energy producers, 
including Chevron and British Petroleum, use natural gas to generate 
electricity through "cogeneration," a process of creating steam for both 
electric generation and heat. With natural gas prices high, they contend, 
they would lose money at the prices Davis is offering.

Lodi Defies Order for Blackouts 
Utility tells PG&E to 'pay the bills' 
Alan Gathright, Chronicle Staff Writer
Friday, March 23, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle 
URL: 
http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/03/23/M
N171303.DTL 
Let history show that the rebellion against rolling blackouts started when 
the Central Valley town of Lodi defied PG&E and refused to unplug its 
customers this week. 
Like several cities that own their own utilities, Lodi saw the energy crunch 
looming last fall and spent millions for long-term power contracts in an 
attempt to avoid blackouts. 
Now, Lodi and a Northern California municipal utility cooperative that 
includes Palo Alto, Santa Clara and Alameda are telling Pacific Gas and 
Electric Co. that it's unfair to force their customers to endure blackouts 
triggered by the near-bankrupt utility's failure to pay its debts. 
"The problem is not paying bills, so pay the bills," said Alan Vallow, 
director of the utility serving Lodi's 58,000 residents. "I won't arbitrarily 
screw my customers . . . so 5,000 PG&E customers can turn on their lights 
somewhere else." 
When PG&E relayed an order from state power regulators Monday and Tuesday for 
Lodi to black out some of its customers, a strategy intended to keep the 
West's power grid from collapsing, Lodi said no. 
So far, other cities in the Northern California Power Agency say they will 
continue to participate in rotating outages. 
But in a letter last Friday to PG&E, members of the agency and four other 
utility districts, including Sacramento's, warned they didn't believe long- 
standing agreements that allow them to use PG&E transmission lines to connect 
to the grid obliged them to endure rolling blackouts because of "PG&E's 
failure to pay its power obligations." 
They say the agreements require them to reduce power demand only in response 
to natural disasters or malfunctions damaging power lines or plants. 
The agencies asked for a meeting with PG&E President Gordon Smith before 
anticipated summer blackouts hit, "to develop a more rational program for 
allocation of risks associated with (power demand) load shedding before you 
call on us to participate in load shedding again." 
REFUSING TO SHARE BURDEN
PG&E officials accused Lodi of selfishly refusing to share the burden of the 
statewide energy crisis. 
"It is regrettable that after reaping the benefits of the (power grid) 
interconnection contract for many years, Lodi is suddenly unwilling to bear 
their share of the burden of the statewide energy crisis," said PG&E 
spokesman Ron Low. "When cities like Lodi do not follow the (state 
Independent System Operator's) order to curtail power, it hurts all of 
California and jeopardizes the entire power grid." 
Low also disagreed with accusations that this week's blackouts were triggered 
by PG&E's failure to pay its bills, noting that the ISO stated that 12,000 
megawatts of power were offline because of plant maintenance. 
But ISO spokeswoman Lisa Szot confirmed assertions by the municipal utilities 
that power generators had kept an additional 3,000 megawatts offline because 
they feared PG&E couldn't pay. 
Lodi's Vallow said he was legally obliged to serve city customers. Lodi 
residents are facing rate increases of as much as 15 percent under a power 
contract that the city secured in hopes of avoiding blackouts. The contract 
required Lodi to pay a $10 million premium above its typical $23 million 
annual energy bill. 
'THAT'S NOT FAIR' 
"I've been hearing (PG&E say), 'Gee, that's not fair. Where's the equity if 
everybody is doing rolling blackouts and you're not?' " Vallow said. "Well, I 
put my customers at financial risk to the tune of $10 million. And if they're 
not going to get to use that power they paid for, then by God, give us that 
money back." 
Vallow said he was willing to sell PG&E some of Lodi's power surplus, knowing 
Lodi might not be paid. 
"But I'm not willing to turn off 5,000 customers, so 5,000 customers 
somewhere else can turn their lights on," Vallow said. "The objective here, 
people, is to keep as many lights on as possible." 
Other city-owned utilities, while annoyed with the rolling blackouts, aren't 
going as far as Lodi. 
WEATHERING BLACKOUTS
"I certainly understand the frustrations of utilities like Lodi and actually 
share those frustrations in many cases," said John Roukema, assistant 
director of Santa Clara's utility. 
But he stressed that his agency had been able to weather blackouts without 
hurting residents or small business, because 17 major industrial power users 
had agreed to curtail demand during energy alerts. 
"The prudent thing to do at this time is to continue to do our share and 
participate in rolling blackouts, because a single problem could cause a 
catastrophic failure in the statewide system," Roukema said. 
In Alameda, residents endured blackouts this week despite the fact that city 
has secured reliable power supplies, said Matt McCabe, spokesman for Alameda 
Power & Telecom. 
"It was in the best of interests of Alamedans to maintain the stability and 
integrity of the grid," he said. "Now, if it becomes evident that the system 
is being jeopardized for financial reasons, then we should not have to 
subject Alamedans to rolling blackouts." 
In Palo Alto, which also had blackouts this week, utility officials told the 
City Council they were expecting a 30 to 40 percent rate hike this spring to 
pay new contracts guaranteeing a stable power supply, said Councilman Bern 
Beecham. The city hopes to avoid giving customers the double whammy of rate 
boosts and more blackouts with a program that gets industrial users to cut 
demand voluntarily during alerts. 
"When there's not enough generating capacity in the state to protect the 
integrity of the grid, that is in fact everybody's problem," Beecham said, 
but that doesn't mean Palo Alto is willing to endure blackouts to prop up 
PG&E's ailing finances. 
"We need to have some very frank discussions with PG&E about mutual 
obligations," Beecham said. 
Energy Tips 
With Californians facing electricity and natural gas shortages, PG&E has 
several tips to help conserve both: 
-- Set the furnace thermostat at 68 degrees or lower, health permitting. 
-- Wash only full loads in a dishwasher. If operating instructions allow, 
turn dishwasher off before the drying cycle and let dishes dry naturally. 
-- Use low-wattage or fluorescent lights. 
-- Fix defective plumbing and dripping faucets, which waste water and 
increase the gas or electric bill for heating the water. 
-- Plug gaps around pipes, ducts, fans and vents that go through walls, 
ceilings and floors. 
-- Keep furnaces clean, and clean or replace the filter regularly. 
-- Turn heaters down when using a fireplace, and close the damper when not 
using the fireplace. 
-- On sunny days, open drapes on windows facing south and let the sun shine 
in. At night, close the drapes to retain indoor heat.

Coming Down to the Wire 
State legislators battle over alternative energy bills 
Greg Lucas, Robert Salladay, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau
Friday, March 23, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle 
URL: 
http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/03/23/M
N113351.DTL 
Sacramento -- After several weeks of slow to no progress in attacking the 
state's energy mess, the Legislature erupted yesterday into a frenzy of 
energy activity. 
The sudden action on a series of energy bills -- including one to let 
businesses buy power directly from generators -- stemmed initially from the 
fear of bad publicity lawmakers might receive for a planned three-day junket 
next week to Washington, D.C. 
When a key bill bogged down in the Assembly late yesterday, Speaker Bob 
Hertzberg, D-Sherman Oaks, announced the trip was canceled. 
Another reason for the flurry of action was recognition that time is running 
out. 
Several alternative energy producers -- like wind farms and biomass plants - 
- said they were one day away from forcing the state's two biggest utilities 
into bankruptcy because they were owed more than $1 billion. 
The Legislature's action and a court ruling that could free alternative 
producers from unpaid contracts. 
"This is triage, members of the Senate," said Sen. Jim Costa, D-Fresno. "This 
is crisis activity we're engaged in." 
The Senate approved a bill aimed at helping state regulators get cash to some 
alternative energy producers. Most of them have been paid little or nothing 
since November by the utilities they sell electricity to. 
Senators passed a bill to help the Public Utilities Commission order 
utilities to pay solar, wind and other alternative energy producers who sign 
lower-priced contracts with the utilities. 
The bill failed in the Assembly because of GOP opposition, fanned in part by 
price concerns by the oil industry, a major co-generation producer. The 
Assembly is set to meet again today to try again pass the bill, which the PUC 
needs to issue its final order. 
The PUC's proposed order offers the first hint of financial relief for 
hundreds of alternative energy producers, known as ''qualified facilities" in 
the energy industry, who have been paid just pennies on the dollar by cash- 
strapped Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison. 
Lack of payments has caused many alternative generators to shutter their 
operations. 
The PUC's proposal, which will be considered at the commission's meeting 
Tuesday, offers generators a choice of agreeing to a five-year contract at 
$79 per megawatt or a 10-year deal at $69 per megawatt, Davis said. The going 
rate now is about $150 a megawatt hour. 
The order does not address money already owed to the more than 600 
alternative energy producers. 
Under the order, utilities would have to pay any generator who signed the new 
contracts within two weeks. 
But PG&E said it might not be able to afford do that. 
Operators of co-generation facilities say the contracts contemplated by the 
PUC don't cover their cost of producing energy because the sale price no 
longer would be pegged to the the price of natural gas. 
In a significant court decision affecting generators, one geothermal energy 
supplier in Imperial County won a lawsuit yesterday against Edison allowing 
the company to escape a contract requiring it to sell electricity to the 
utility. 
A superior court judge said CalEnergy, operator of the geothermal plant, 
could suspend deliveries to Edison and sell the 268 megawatt hours it 
generated on the open market. 
CalEnergy is owed $75 million by the utility. 
The court victory may ease mounting pressure from some qualified facilities, 
including CalEnergy, to drive one or both of the utilities into involuntary 
bankruptcy. 
The Assembly and Senate, meanwhile, rushed through a series of bills aimed at 
increasing energy conservation, and rushing the building of new power plants. 
Most significant for bigger residential and commercial utility customers is a 
measure passed by the Assembly to allow energy customers to buy power 
directly from generators. 
That right was eliminated in January when the state began buying power for 
the cash-strapped utilities. 
The bill approved unanimously yesterday would impose a yet to be determined 
exit fee on customers who leave the power grid to help cover the state's 
financial exposure. 
Tell Us What You Think 
Can you save 20 percent on your energy use? Gov. Gray Davis' administration 
is offering rebates for Californians who save on power starting in June, and

State's bill for energy could double this year 
Posted at 9:34 p.m. PST Thursday, March 22, 2001 
BY 
STEVE 
JOHNSON 
AND 
JOHN 
Warning that California is imperiled by the prices it is paying for 
electricity, a report Thursday said the state's annual power tab could wind 
up being 10 times what it was two years ago. 
At the current rate of spending, the report estimated that the total 
electricity bill in California this year could hit $70 billion, which is more 
than twice what it was last year and about 10 times what was paid in 1999 and 
1998. 
``The California electricity market has gone from being `dysfunctional' to 
precipitating a crisis,'' according to the report from the Independent System 
Operator. 
It added that the price being charged ``threatens any semblance of just and 
reasonable consumer rates, the financial viability of California's 
investor-owned utilities, the financial stability of California, of its 
neighboring states and of the nation.'' 
While power suppliers denied any wrongdoing, the report said the state 
appears to have been hit with ``excess'' charges totaling $6.87 billion since 
May, based on an assessment of the typical operating costs of power plant 
owners. Out of that total, $6.2 billion appeared to be excessive charges 
during times when power was not in particularly short supply, the agency 
said. 
The cost of power has become a growing concern now that the state has stepped 
in to buy it on behalf of Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California 
Edison, which claim to be so strapped for cash that they are on the verge of 
bankruptcy. 
In making public the report, which was sent to the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission, officials at the Independent System Operator were careful not to 
accuse any power companies of price gouging. While the prices appeared to be 
unreasonable, they said, the state needs to learn more about the specific 
operating costs of power plant operators before they could determine whether 
California was cheated. 
The officials said they were considering asking the federal agency, which 
oversees power wholesalers, to order the suppliers to make refunds. In the 
past two weeks, the federal agency has warned a number of suppliers that they 
may have to refund $135 million in apparent overcharges during January and 
February. 
But many experts question whether the federal agency is serious about 
demanding such refunds, so California officials also are reviewing the 
possibility of suing the suppliers or seeking criminal charges against some 
of them. ``We're working very closely with a number of agencies to review the 
information we currently have to determine what remedies may be available,'' 
said Charles Robinson, the Independent System Operator's general counsel. 
The report's suspicions were partly bolstered by another study made public 
Thursday by the state auditor. It said California's market structure 
encouraged bidding gamesmanship by both utilities and power sellers ``in an 
effort to manipulate wholesale prices to their advantage.'' But it stopped 
short of accusing power generators of profiting illegally. 
``There's clearly some evidence of market abuse,'' said state Auditor Elaine 
Howle. Even so, she added, ``that's not to say it's anything illegal. We 
hired consultants, they looked at some of the bidding, and they weren't 
comfortable going that far.'' 
Although no power companies were named in either report, officials with 
several suppliers insisted they have done nothing wrong. 
``We've conducted our business legally and ethically,'' said Richard 
Wheatley, spokesman for Reliant Energy, which runs five major California 
power plants. ``The ISO report appears to be nothing more than just another 
attempt to put blame at someone else's doorstep, when there's been very 
little action out of Sacramento to resolve the problems in the California 
marketplace.'' 
Duke Energy spokesman Jeremy Dreier said the company, which runs plants in 
Moss Landing and Morro Bay, sold most of its power last year and this year in 
relatively low-cost, long-term contracts, and was among the first to offer 
such deals to the state. He added that Duke increased production from its 
aging plants to meet surging demand. 
``The fact that we were among the first to bring long-term contracts to the 
table speaks volumes about how we're trying to serve this market,'' Dreier 
said. 
John Sousa of Dynegy Inc., which co-owns three major California plants, added 
that ``given the market conditions, the rates we charged were just and 
reasonable.''

Plan for alternate power plants stalls 
Posted at 10:03 p.m. PST Thursday, March 22, 2001 
BY DION NISSENBAUM AND JENNIFER BJORHUS 

Mercury News 


SACRAMENTO -- The state's prospects for plugging a critical electricity gap 
dimmed Thursday when the state Assembly rejected a rescue plan for 
alternative power companies and a state judge ruled that one such firm could 
stop selling energy in California. 
Both actions threaten the plan Gov. Gray Davis announced just Tuesday to keep 
these companies running and stave off more blackouts. With the state's 
troubled utilities failing to pay for their electricity, many alternative 
energy plants have been shutting down. 
The dual blows came on a day when tempers flared in the Capitol as lawmakers 
jarred by back-to-back blackouts launched bipartisan attacks on Pacific Gas & 
Electric Co. and Southern California Edison, which aren't paying wind, solar, 
biomass, geothermal and small gas-fired plants for their electricity. 
After Republicans shot down the measure meant to keep alternative energy 
companies in business, Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys, warned 
that the restless companies might act on their threat to force the utilities 
into bankruptcy. 
``They said it, and I understood them to mean it,'' he said. 
The failure overshadowed a burst of action in Sacramento where lawmakers 
approved a host of other measures. The Senate approved two key bills: one 
that would spend more than $1 billion to encourage Californians to conserve 
energy and one that would make it easier to build power plants. The Assembly 
approved 14 incremental bills. 
Six votes short 
But the Assembly fell six votes short of passing a hastily prepared bill 
meant to help prop up the nearly 700 alternative energy companies, many of 
which are now idle. 
Those closings sapped California of energy this week and helped cause two 
days of rolling blackouts -- the first since January. 
In response, Davis and lawmakers cobbled together a plan to set new, lower 
rates for alternative power and to fine the utilities if they refuse to pay 
these companies, which supply up to a third of the state's power. 
But Republicans refused to back the measure and said it contained too many 
complex parts that needed more time to analyze. 
``Everyone in this room knows that this piece of legislation has not had a 
good look,'' said Assemblyman George Runner, R-Lancaster. 
Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Santa Cruz, castigated the Republicans and 
implored them to accept an imperfect solution. 
``Ladies and gentlemen: Welcome to the NFL,'' he said. ``Welcome to the world 
where large, complex issues don't have a simple solution.'' 
Approval is needed before state regulators at the Public Utilities Commission 
can vote on the fine points of the plan. That was supposed to happen Tuesday. 
Much of the criticism focused on concerns raised by power plants that use 
natural gas to produce energy. Administrators from those plants said the 
Davis price caps would make it impossible for them to break even. 
The derailment came hours after the measure narrowly won approval in the 
state Senate. 
Hertzberg plans to search for a compromise today and canceled plans for the 
Assembly's annual trip to Washington. 
Thursday's actions were highlighted by angry attacks on the utilities by 
frustrated lawmakers. 
``I hope they do go bankrupt,'' shouted Senate President pro tem John Burton, 
D-San Francisco, during a debate on the energy crisis. ``Let them go belly 
up. I don't care any more.'' 
Legal decision adds twist 
The legislative failure was compounded by a legal decision in Southern 
California that further complicated the picture. 
A Superior Court judge in Imperial County cleared the way for CalEnergy 
Operating Corp. to break its contract with Edison and sell its 268 megawatts 
of power on the open market. The judge concluded that Edison had breached its 
contract by failing to pay CalEnergy since November. 
That ruling could pave the way for hundreds of others to follow suit and 
drain off power California needs to prevent blackouts. 
``It's not good,'' said V. John White, director of the Center for Energy 
Efficiency and Renewable Technologies. ``This is potentially going to change 
the dynamics of the situation, and probably not for the better.'' 
Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers 
Association, said it was unclear whether other companies would sue. 
``I think this is a very significant development,'' he said. ``We're sort of 
at a period where the industry's reaching the end of the rope.'' 
The ruling did have one silver lining: CalEnergy Chairman David Sokol said 
his company and seven others had planned to force Edison into bankruptcy if 
they lost in court. 
But he also warned, ``You stick a sharp stick in enough people's eyes, and 
they get pretty tired of it.'' 
The situation with generators supplying PG&E isn't as dire since the company 
has been making partial payments. 
Kent Burton, senior vice president for Covanta Energy Corp. in New Jersey, 
said, ``They've tried to be responsive.''

Davis to push backup diesel By Chris Bowman Bee Staff Writer (Published May 24, 2001)  In a major reversal of environmental policy, Gov. Gray Davis will announce a plan to relieve California's overloaded electricity grid this summer by paying businesses to run their high-polluting backup generators in advance of anticipated blackouts, a top energy adviser to the governor said Wednesday.  "The backup generators will help us get through the summer," said S. David Freeman, who recently resigned as general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power to lead Davis' drive for energy conservation.  Freeman said he would leave it to Davis to disclose details of the plan.  "The governor will announce what he's going to do," he said Wednesday in a wide-ranging interview on energy issues with The Bee.  Roger Salazar, the governor's deputy press secretary, would not confirm when or whether Davis would make such an announcement.  "I don't know that the governor has signed off on anything like that," Salazar said.  Under the plan, participating businesses would turn on backup generators and simultaneously disconnect from the electricity grid when power supplies are at Stage 3 -- nearly depleted.  The state would pay the companies for the much-needed power that would be saved by converting to diesel generation.  Deploying diesel-powered generators -- the dirtiest of internal combustion engines -- to forestall blackouts is another sign of the governor's struggle to get more megawatts flowing through California.  Earlier this week Davis lowered his estimate of the amount of new power that will come on line this summer from 5,000 megawatts to 4,000 megawatts. A megawatt is enough power for 750 to 1,000 households.  The diesel plan also marks a significant turnabout in the Davis administration's policy.  The governor and his appointees at the state Air Resources Board uniformly have rejected such proposals from industries, utilities and the operator of the state's electricity grid, arguing that routine use of the backup diesels would endanger public health.  San Diego Gas & Electric has one such proposal scheduled for a vote today by the Davis-appointed state Public Utilities Commission.  Environmentalists who have been catching word of the Davis plan this week argue that it would shatter the governor's repeated promises to stand firm on air quality standards during the energy crisis.  A letter signed Wednesday by several of the state's leading environmental organizations, including the American Lung Association of California, urged Davis to reconsider.  "Given your awareness of the public health threats of diesel emissions, please stop and have these proposals considered in a more thoughtful and public manner," the letter states.  Freeman argued, however, that the additional health threat from non-emergency use of diesel generators is "marginal" compared with the health and safety problems triggered by power outages.  "This is a no-brainer," Freeman said. "You've got human lives at stake here. This is a scary situation."  Freeman cited, for example, people on life-support systems that could go awry in blackouts.  But Sandra Spelliscy, attorney for the environmentalist Planning and Conservation League, countered, "If the health impacts are so marginal, why has the governor's own air quality enforcement agency opposed this?"  Industries ranging from hospitals to food processing plants and data management centers have diesel-powered generators -- some the size of locomotives -- that kick on when a storm or earthquake knocks out power.  Unlike diesel-powered trucks and buses, most diesel standby generators run with little or no pollution controls because they are intended only for emergencies.  Though the latest models run cleaner and more efficiently, most generators in use today produce about 500 times more emissions of smog-forming nitrogen oxides per megawatt-hour as a new natural gas-fired power plant, according to air board engineers. Further, the diesels spew high amounts of breathable soot particles that can cause cancer, the engineers say.  Davis' plan would limit the use of the generators to days when the grid operator declares a Stage 3 alert, meaning the power supplies are running low and rolling blackouts may be ordered to keep the state's entire grid from collapsing, according to Freeman.  Salazar, the governor's spokesman, said only, "Any backup generation involving diesel will have to be used as a last resort to prevent blackouts."  Environmentalists who are trying to head off the plan said it would have the state paying participating businesses at least 35 cents per kilowatt-hour, roughly three times the rate consumers typically pay for electricity. Freeman would not confirm the pay rate.  The Davis administration has offered generators willing to sell new power exclusively to the state 50 percent discounts on the air emission credits they would need to comply with smog rules.  For operators of existing power plants, the governor has agreed to have taxpayers pay the entire cost of polluting above allowable limits in order to keep the lights on.  The latest plan to pay companies to run the dirty diesels during energy alerts further loosens the environmental reins.

Bush-Davis meeting set for energy crisis By David Whitney Bee Washington Bureau (Published May 24, 2001)  WASHINGTON -- President Bush will meet next week with Gov. Gray Davis to talk about California's worsening electricity crisis amid a shifting political dynamic on Capitol Hill that increasingly favors some controls on West Coast wholesale electricity prices.  Details for the Bush-Davis meeting were still being worked out Wednesday, but the fact that the Republican president is meeting with the Democratic governor, who is often mentioned as a possible challenger in 2004, was seen as a sign that the White House is facing increasing political heat on the energy issue.  "California is a very big state," said White House spokesman Ari Fleischer. "It represents one-sixth of the United States. It's the sixth-largest economy in the world. And the president is very pleased to sit and talk with Governor Davis. It's important."  Davis' spokesman, Steve Maviglio, said electricity price caps will be at the top of the governor's agenda for the meeting on Tuesday or Wednesday. But Fleischer did not commit the president to that kind of meeting.  In his first visit to the state since the campaign last year, the president will spend Monday night in Los Angeles and Tuesday night in Fresno.  Until now, the White House has steadfastly refused to meet with any elected Democrat from California about the energy crisis despite repeated pleas from the Democratic congressional delegation.  Price controls have become the mantra of California Democratic lawmakers and a handful of Republicans, but the Bush administration has flatly dismissed them as counterproductive to increasing power generation in the megawatt-short state.  In recent weeks, however, there has been a developing shift in the attitude toward price controls on Capitol Hill. Bush's two nominees to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, whose names were forwarded to the Senate floor Wednesday for confirmation, declined to rule out price controls once they are seated on the panel.  And the apparent decision by Vermont Sen. James Jeffords to abandon the Republican Party would put Democrats in control of the Senate, moving Sen. Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico, a price-control advocate, to the helm of the key Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.  California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a committee Democrat, said Wednesday that she has talked to Bingaman and that he committed to moving her legislation to temporarily peg wholesale prices to the cost of production.  Four Republican House members from California have also endorsed some form of price-control legislation.  On Wednesday, Rep. Doug Ose, R-Sacramento, announced that he is introducing a bill that, while not technically a price cap, would give greater price relief for West Coast consumers than federal regulators or the Bush administration have been willing to offer.  Ose, chairman of the House Government Reform Committee's energy subcommittee, said his bill would extend throughout the West a price-mitigation plan approved last month by the FERC. But instead of that plan taking effect only during power emergencies as the commission directed, it would operate around the clock under Ose's bill to peg spot market prices at the cost of production of the least-efficient plant selling into the California market.  Ose said his bill would encourage generators to sell their power through long-term contracts rather than on the volatile spot market.  "I am looking for a middle ground," Ose said.

Energy Digest: GOP unveils plan to help utility By Jim Sanders Bee Capitol Bureau (Published May 24, 2001)  State Assembly efforts to develop a bipartisan proposal to help Southern California Edison pay off massive debts and avoid bankruptcy hit a dead end Wednesday when Republicans released a plan of their own.  The move could force Democrats to sidestep Republicans and vote along party lines on an alternative to Gov. Gray Davis' proposed $2.76 billion state purchase of power lines.  Assembly Republican leader Dave Cox of Fair Oaks said Wednesday's split was necessary because there are few differences between the governor's plan and the Democrats' plan.  The Republican plan rejects the notion of purchasing transmission lines or hydroelectric facilities.  Key components call for dedicating a portion of consumer rates to allow Edison to pay off $3.5 billion in debts. In return, ratepayers would receive either an equity stake in future power plants or the right to purchase electricity at discount rates.	








Few escape blame for crisis in poll By Dan Smith Bee Deputy Capitol Bureau Chief (Published May 24, 2001)  Utility companies and out-of-state power generators continue to get the lowest marks for their performance in California's energy crisis, but Gov. Gray Davis' grades have slipped dramatically over the past five months, according to a Field Poll released Wednesday.  And Californians, it turns out, blame plenty of people for the state's power woes -- except themselves.  Every player in the power drama gets poor marks except "residential energy consumers," which 39 percent of poll respondents say are doing a good or very good job to improve the energy situation. Only 22 percent think they are doing a poor or very poor job.  Public opinion of residential consumers' efforts has improved since January, when 32 percent thought they were doing a poor job and only 26 percent gave them high marks.  "The public sees themselves as conserving energy," said Field Poll Director Mark DiCamillo. "That's the only positive movement in the survey."  For Davis, who faces re-election next year, the movement is far from positive.  In the January poll, the Democratic governor received good marks from 41 percent of those surveyed, average grades from 31 percent and poor ratings from only 22 percent.  But when the Field Institute conducted its recent poll between May 11 and Sunday, opinions about Davis flip-flopped. After months of energy angst, a handful of power blackouts and two rate increases, only 27 percent think Davis is doing a good job, while 38 percent gave him failing grades. The poll also shows that Californians believe the crisis will continue by an average of a year and a half, well through the upcoming re-election battle.  "All the rhetoric Davis used with some positive effect early on is not going over well any more," DiCamillo said. "The public is starting to view this as a long-term problem, not some temporary policy shift."  Still, Davis fares far better than his adversaries in the crisis -- President Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney and the energy industry.  The public's view of energy interests, which was pretty dim in January, drops even lower in the May poll. Utility companies received bad ratings from half the public in January, but 57 percent now believe they are doing a poor or very poor job. Out-of-state energy generators, whom Davis has accused of gouging ratepayers, fell from 44 percent low ratings in January to 55 percent in the May poll.  Bush, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the state Public Utilities Commission are not far behind, drawing poor grades from more than half the public. Cheney, the architect of Bush's energy proposal, received low ratings from 43 percent. The January Field Poll did not ask about Bush and Cheney because they had not yet taken office.  Davis has repeatedly bashed FERC for not imposing wholesale price caps on electricity, and has called Cheney "grossly misinformed" on the state's energy problems. Cheney, in turn, has called Davis' energy proposals "harebrained" and "goofy."  The state Legislature receives poor marks from 41 percent of those polled, while only 16 percent believe it is doing a good job.

        New views emerging on power More elected officials support the concept of planned blackouts By John Hill Bee Capitol Bureau  (Published May 23, 2001)  If Californians are to be left in the dark, they should at least know when to break out the candles or send the workers home.  That's the growing sentiment among a range of elected officials, including Gov. Gray Davis, who are pushing the idea of planning power blackouts and giving businesses and residents ample warning.  On Tuesday, the Democratic governor's office said Davis supports longer public notice than the 24 hours called for under a proposal by the California Independent System Operator, which runs the state's power grid.  Assemblyman Mike Briggs, R-Fresno, introduced a bill that would lay out a blackout schedule for the summer. Businesses could make plans for the possible blackout days and also be assured that on all other days the lights would stay on.  Briggs called his plan an improvement on the existing system in which "every day is a potential blackout day."  A Senate committee, meanwhile, discussed planned blackouts as part of a strategy to gain leverage over electricity generators by declaring that the state will not pay above a certain amount for power. The state would ask Washington and Oregon to join the so-called "buyers' cartel."  If the power generators refused to sell at the lower prices, the state would gut it out with planned blackouts.  "Let's use the blackouts against the generators," Michael Shames, head of the San Diego-based Utility Consumers' Action Network, told the Energy, Utilities and Communications Committee. But Shames and others stressed the need for warnings of at least 12 hours and blackouts no longer than 90 minutes.  "Absent that management of blackouts, we don't see how the buyers' cartel could work," Shames said.  On a visit to Chicago on Monday, Davis said he talked to officials about the city's system for giving the public warning days before possible power blackouts, with definite notice right before.  "There is no reason to keep that secret from the public when their safety is likely to be jeopardized," Davis told reporters Tuesday. The governor said he plans to meet in the next few days with managers at ISO to explore the idea of a system like Chicago's.  The grid operator announced Monday that it will try to give the public at least a half-hour notice of outages, but many officials said Tuesday the public needs even more warning. Davis aides said the governor's plan will go beyond ISO's.  There are potential pitfalls. Criminals might make their own plans, taking advantage of deactivated alarms. And some say that a schedule of blackouts might increase the number of outages.  If people have been warned that a blackout is coming, and a last-minute supply of electricity makes it unnecessary, grid managers would have to decide whether to call it off, said Dorothy Rothrock, vice president of the California Manufacturers & Technology Association.  If they did, it would add uncertainty to future warnings, she said, possibly leading them to order unnecessary blackouts.  "Obviously, there are trade-offs," Rothrock said.  Still, the idea of planning blackouts seems to be gaining ground as a way for the state to get back some control of the energy crisis, sorely lacking in recent months.  "It would help us as Californians to say, 'The hell with you, George Bush, we're going to handle this ourselves,' " said Jim Overman, 68, of Elk Grove.  Overman said he has been burning up the phone lines trying to persuade anyone who will listen that scheduled blackouts will make everyone's lives easier.  Briggs said he has been told by constituents, including irrigators and food processors, that scheduled blackouts are the way to go.  Irrigators would know that they shouldn't plan on getting water on a day that their electronic gates might be closed.  Businesses could tell workers to stay home on a blackout day, or arrange for backup power generators, he said.  "We would be very interested in it," said Ed Yates, senior vice president of the California League of Food Processors.  Power blackouts are chaotic for processing plants, Yates said, requiring some plants to be re-sterilized and shutting down operations for more than a day.  Some processors might choose to close on days when they faced a blackout, he said, losing revenue but avoiding the loss of thousands of pounds of food.  "It doesn't solve the problem, but it helps manage a very difficult situation," he said.  Briggs said that his plan would result in possible blackout days every two weeks. The plan would assume that a certain number of customers would have to turned off to keep the grid operating. If the electricity shortage went above that amount, people might still face unanticipated blackouts, Briggs said.  One question is public safety. Some are queasy about burglars knowing when blackouts will occur. But pluses include the ability to arrange for temporary stop signs at road intersections, or families being able to arrange for a sick relative to be moved.  "If the police have only five minutes notice, they can't get to difficult intersections to direct traffic, they can't help paramedics, fire departments and ambulances get where they have to be," Davis said.  The manufacturers' association and other business groups haven't endorsed the idea yet, but say it's worth a look.  "It's preferable to random, rolling blackouts," Rothrock said.

        Californians' priorities for solving the crisis are outlined in a Field Poll * Related graphic   By Dan Smith Bee Deputy Capitol Bureau Chief  (Published May 23, 2001)  Californians have some clear ideas on how to solve the energy crisis: build more nuclear power plants, cap the wholesale price of electricity and relax air-quality standards to allow older plants to be upgraded.  And, according to a Field Poll released Tuesday, they're not so hot on the recently approved $13.4 billion bond authorization to pay for electricity, or the idea of Gov. Gray Davis seizing power plants through eminent domain.  Poll architects said responses may be somewhat colored by respondents' unfamiliarity with all the issues or skepticism on the causes of the state's power woes. Nearly 60 percent said it essentially is an artificial crisis created by power companies to make money.  But on one longstanding issue -- nuclear power -- the poll showed a clear preference and a dramatic shift in public opinion.  In the highest recorded support for nuclear power in California since before the Three Mile Island disaster in 1979, 59 percent say they favor more nuclear plants in the state to provide electricity.  Support among registered voters grows to 61 percent, with 33 percent opposed. Among Democrats, 53 percent support more nuclear plants, and three-fourths of Republicans and 55 percent of others agree.  "The change in attitude is very significant because they know this issue," Field Poll Director Mark DiCamillo said.  Californians' support for nuclear power reached nearly 70 percent in the mid-1970s in the aftermath of a nationwide energy crisis. But it plummeted to 37 percent in 1979 after the partial meltdown at Pennsylvania's Three Mile Island plant and fell to 33 percent in 1984 -- the last time Field surveyed the question.  In 1989, voters demanded that the Sacramento Municipal Utility District's Rancho Seco nuclear plant be shut down. The utility complied and has spent more than $200 million decommissioning it during the past 12 years.  Although the poll results are in line with some private surveys done recently by nuclear-energy advocates, opponents say the Field Poll opinions could be misleading because the issue has been dormant for so long. Not since the late '70s has an application for a nuclear plant been filed in the United States. Only two operate in California -- San Onofre in San Diego County and Diablo Canyon in San Luis Obispo.  "When the (poll) questions are on issues that people haven't thought about that much lately, you do get some aberrant results," said Bill Magavern, a lobbyist for the Sierra Club. "People right now are obviously concerned about electricity, but they haven't really thought about what it would be like to have a nuclear power plant in the neighborhood."  The Field Poll results lend support to at least one aspect in the national energy plan recently released by President Bush, who called for more nuclear power plants nationwide.  But poll respondents were even more insistent that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission should impose caps on wholesale energy prices despite opposition from the Bush administration. The poll showed 70 percent of all adults and 68 percent of registered voters -- including 57 percent of Bush's fellow Republicans -- support the price controls.  "It really does expose the Bush administration to long-term serious problems in California if they're perceived as not willing to help the state in this regard," DiCamillo said. "The public really thinks (price caps) should be imposed."  Republicans in the survey support price caps despite Bush opposition, and Democrats narrowly oppose the move by Democratic lawmakers and Davis to authorize the largest bond sale in national history to pay for power purchases.  Among all adults, 38 percent approve of the move, and 52 percent oppose it. Democrats disapprove of the bonds by a 46 percent to 44 percent margin.  Californians' desire for clean air is softening in the face of the energy crunch, respondents said.  By a margin of 51 percent to 41 percent, poll respondents say they would maintain air-quality standards rather than relax them to build plants. That support is down from a Field survey in January, when 59 percent said they'd rather maintain standards. Moreover, a majority (53 percent) say they would relax air-quality standards to get older plants back in operation, an increase from 47 percent in January.  Slight majorities support a state-run public power authority (54 percent) and state-owned power transmission lines (51 percent), but DiCamillo said that some poll respondents were probably not familiar with all the implications of those moves.  Responses to the idea of Davis seizing power plants if prices continue to rise this summer fell somewhat down partisan lines, with Democrats in favor, 50 percent to 42 percent, and Republicans opposed, 52 percent to 32 percent. Overall, the idea was rejected by 48 percent of adults and favored by 44 percent.  A strong majority of registered voters, 56 percent, oppose additional offshore oil and gas drilling to ease the energy crunch, and 38 percent favor it.

        Offshore drilling waits in the wings   (Published May 23, 2001)  WASHINGTON -- The release today of a piece of President Bush's energy policy has California lawmakers squirming.  A natural gas advisory panel is set to unveil a 56-page report looking at whether moratoriums on offshore oil and gas development should be lifted. It will also name specific sites for possible drilling.  Rep. Anna Eschoo, D-Palo Alto, said Tuesday that if the Bush administration tries to undo moratoriums protecting more than 170 million acres off the California coast, it would be like "targeting a missile at us."  So far, the Bush administration hasn't taken any direct action. The energy policy he released last week calls for more oil and gas development, but its only recommendation about offshore drilling was that the secretaries of interior and commerce re-examine current laws and executive orders "to determine if changes are needed."  Today's report is to urge selection of five of the most promising gas prospects in offshore areas covered by moratoriums in a pilot program aimed at eventual drilling. The report doesn't say where those five pilot areas should be. But Reps. Lois Capps, D-Santa Barbara, and Mike Thompson, D-Napa, are fearful that Morro Bay in San Louis Obispo County and the Eel River Basin in Humboldt County in their districts are likely choices.  -- David Whitney 	








Bush, Davis to meet, discuss state's energy crisis 	



By Finlay Lewis COPLEY NEWS SERVICE  May 23, 2001  WASHINGTON - After weeks of holding California and its electricity crisis at arm's length, President Bush will plunge into the problem next week during a two-day visit to the state that will include a possible energy summit with California Gov. Gray Davis.  White House press secretary Ari Fleischer told reporters Wednesday that the state's energy crisis will be "at the top of the list" when the president and the governor meet. The president's aides said that the time and place for the meeting are still being worked out.  Bush's visit to the state will be his first since last fall's campaign. With their party enjoying only a slim majority in the U.S. House, some California Republicans have expressed dismay over their state's absence from the president's extensive post-inaugural travel schedule, fearing that the energy crisis could cost some GOP lawmakers their seats in next year's elections. 	



Fleischer's announcement Wednesday of the meeting with Davis and its emphasis on energy caught many by surprise because the White House had given no hint until then that the president would address the issue during his upcoming trip to California.  However, Davis called the White House on Tuesday night proposing a meeting with the president specifically to discuss energy.  He followed up with two letters on Wednesday expressing the need for quicker action on the energy front: "Californians can't afford to wait four or five years for a permanent solution. We need relief today."  In the longer of two letters, Davis wrote: "You and I don't agree on everything. But here's something we do have in common: we both inherited an energy mess. And the people that elected us expect us to clean it up."  Davis also offered in the letters to "introduce" Bush to "business owners and everyday citizens who have been personally affected by this energy crisis."  Fleischer said Wednesday that Bush would meet with "business leaders and energy consumers."  Asked who initiated the meeting with Davis, Fleischer suggested the president's schedule had been drawn up independently of Davis' suggestions.  "This is a case of they both want to meet with each other, and we're very pleased to be able to make it work out," he said.  As for the meeting with the business leaders, Fleischer said, "The president has several events on his schedule that already include business leaders and energy consumers, and so it very well may happen that we're each suggesting similar things, which would be a healthy sign."  Bush's itinerary also includes a stop on Tuesday at the Camp Pendleton Marine Corps Base designed to showcase his order directing the military to cut their energy use by 10 percent at California facilities.  Fleischer said that the president wanted "to talk about how the federal government is going to be a strong partner to the state of California in the cause of energy conservation to help ease the burden in California as they go through the summer months when demand is high and blackouts are most at risk."  The White House released an outline of the president's California itinerary on Tuesday afternoon. It indicated that the visit would not give prominent attention to the state's energy woes.  Fleischer declined to say whether the president would expand on his energy plan in any way while in California.  Davis and other California Democrats have been sharply critical of the Bush administration for failing to take decisive action to help alleviate the electricity shortage's toll on the state and its citizens.  They are backing legislation due to come to a key vote on Thursday before the House Energy and Commerce Committee that would cap electricity rates in the state. The administration and most of the state's Republican lawmakers oppose the measure.  Last week, Bush showcased an administration task force report on the nation's energy challenges that stressed long-range solutions focused mainly on increasing the supply of fossil fuels and an expanded role for nuclear power. The report also suggested incentives to encourage energy conservation and greater fuel efficiency.  Bush's trip will begin on Monday when he flies from a Memorial Day event in Arizona to Los Angeles where he will spend the night. He will return to Washington on Wednesday night after a visit to the Fresno area.  Bush assumed office despite losing the nation's most populous state by a decisive margin and then launched into the most ambitious travel schedule of any modern president. It included stops in 27 states - not California.  (Lewis reported from Washington and Sweeney from Sacramento. 	






California Democrats seek price caps on electricity

By Finlay Lewis
COPLEY NEWS SERVICE 
May 22, 2001 
WASHINGTON - Accusing power generators of price gouging, a group of California House Democrats vowed Tuesday to try again this week to legislate price caps in order to bring down the energy bills in the state. 
Rep. Henry Waxman, a Los Angeles Democrat and author of the price-cap measure, said he would offer the measure as an amendment on Thursday. At that time the House Energy and Commerce Committee plans to complete work on a bill designed to reduce the number of blackouts expected in California this summer due to shortages in the supply of electrical power. 
Waxman and other Democrats seized on Republican fund-raising events on Monday and Tuesday nights involving President Bush and Vice President Cheney, charging the Republican administration with exacerbating the California situation by doing the bidding of the oil and gas industry in return for campaign contributions. 
"This is a contrived crisis in order to wreck our environmental protection laws," Waxman said. "It is a contrived crisis in order to produce 1000 percent increases in profits for some of these generators." 
On the agenda when the committee meets Thursday will be a bill by Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, that would allow California Gov. Gray Davis to temporarily waive some air pollution limits to increase power production in the state when blackouts are imminent. 
It also would include: 
  federal help to ease a power transmission bottleneck in the Central Valley; 
  mandated power savings at federal facilities; 
  state discretion in adjusting daylight savings time; 
  an easing of the ties of some small, independent power generators to large utilities. 
Earlier this month, a subcommittee chaired by Barton rejected Waxman's price-cap amendment as some California Republicans complained that the idea of limiting power rates was politically inspired and would do nothing to solve California's crisis. 
The Bush administration and the energy industry oppose price caps, saying that such an approach would distort the market and worsen the electricity shortage in California and many other western states by discouraging exploration and production. 
Waxman's plan would require federal regulators in many cases to tie wholesale power rates to production costs, plus a "reasonable" profit. 
At the press conference, Rep. Bob Filner, D-San Diego, derided Republican opposition to price caps. 
Referring to wholesale power generators, Filner argued, "They were making money at $30 a megawatt; now they are charging up to $2,000. Believe me: They can make money off the market with a cost-base rate. They have done it for 100 years. They can continue doing it." 
Rep. Jane Harman, D-Redondo Beach, said that California Republicans on the energy committee would suffer politically if they give into pressure from party leaders to oppose the price-cap bill. 
"There are no party affiliations for rate payers," said Harman, a committee member. "Republicans and Democrats have both seen the gouging of their rates in California." 






Mexico: No limit on number of new plants to be built 	
	




Energy chief says 'anyone who requests a permit will get it' By Diane Lindquist  UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER  May 22, 2001  Mexican Energy Secretary Ernesto Martens said yesterday that Mexico won't set any limit on the number of power plants in Baja California supplying electricity north of the border.  "Since there's a window of opportunity here because of the need in California for electricity, anyone who requests a permit will get it," Martens said after speaking at the Institute of the Americas' 10th annual Latin American Energy Conference in La Jolla.  Power plant construction in Baja California has become one of the most immediate solutions to California's electricity shortfalls. At least three plants being built in Baja California in the next four years will send electricity north of the border, where blackouts have interrupted normal activity.  One facility, a Sempra Energy Corp. power plant near Mexicali, will export all of its electrical output to consumers north of the border. The San Diego company's project gained quick approval from Mexican authorities because the facility is not subject to restrictions imposed on private companies that supply electricity to the Mexican market.  Other Mexican energy officials have said several other enterprises are interested in building similar facilities in Baja California.  Such a mushrooming of projects is prompting concern on both sides of the border that the plants might have harmful effects on natural resources and public health and safety.  In his speech, Martens emphasized Mexico's commitment to preserving the environment and local communities.  But afterward, he said Mexico will approve any number of Baja California projects to serve California consumers.  "I don't see any limit. The only limit is the ability of the interconnecting lines to transmit the electricity that is produced," he said.  With a capacity of only 400 megawatts each, the two transmission interconnections linking the electricity grids of California and Baja California will not be able to transmit all of the 1,500 megawatts of electricity for the California market produced by the new Baja California plants -- let alone any additional facilities.  Sempra, whose San Diego Gas & Electric subsidiary owns both the interconnecting lines, plans to upgrade the interconnector near Mexicali, spokesman Michael Clark said yesterday. The improvement will transmit electricity from Sempra's plant in Baja California to the company substation in Imperial Valley. The other connection links San Diego and Tijuana.  Clark said he doesn't know how the other companies building Baja California plants plan to transmit their electricity. Representatives of the firms could not be reached yesterday.  Even if the companies find a way to send electricity across the border, the California grid system presents another obstacle.  To prepare for the possibility of more demands on the Southern California grid, the Imperial Irrigation District is analyzing what capacity it has for transmitting supplies on its lines and how to assess tariffs for the service.  "It's become very important because of our proximity to Mexico," said district spokesman Ron Hull.  The ability to transmit electricity is only one force limiting plant construction in Baja California. Another is the supply of fuel to drive the facilities.  Sempra again is a key player in this area. It plans to build a North Baja Pipeline that will supply natural gas to its own and two other power plants in Baja California and the proposed Otay Mesa plant in San Diego. The pipeline won't provide fuel for any other facilities.  "It's fully subscribed," said Clark. "In the future if there is enough demand, the compression could be increased."  Energy Secretary Martens, however, hinted at the possibility of new natural gas supplies in Baja California. He said Mexico wants liquified natural gas facilities to be built in Rosarito Beach and Ensenada.  While several companies have expressed an interest in such an operation, Martens' comments were the first to indicate that two, and not one, might be approved for Baja California. 	





Potential governor candidate launches Northern California tour

(05-24) 00:01 PDT LIVERMORE, Calif. (AP) -- 
Republican William E. Simon Jr. says he won't decide until the first week of June whether to jump into the race for governor, although he appeared to be campaigning for the job this week. 
Trailed by a group of reporters Wednesday, the wealthy Pacific Palisades investment banker visited Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and took a few jabs at both Democratic Gov. Gray Davis and his potential GOP primary opponent, Secretary of State Bill Jones. 
"I think there's a leadership crisis in Sacramento," said Simon, who criticized Davis' handling of the state's power crisis. 
"You have the same elected people today trying to figure out a solution to the crisis that got us into the crisis," Simon said. 
Pressed to explain how he would end the crisis that has brought rolling blackouts and soaring power bills, Simon said he still is preparing his own plan. 
The son of Ford administration Treasury Secretary William E. Simon insisted he has yet to make a final decision on whether to run in 2002, adding he would make up his mind by June 4 after consulting with his family. 
Asked if he has any ties to companies profiting from the power crisis, Simon said he owns a "small piece" of a Texas-based company that makes equipment used in extracting or processing oil and natural gas. 
Before founding his investment banking firm with his father in 1988 he was an assistant U.S. attorney in New York. 
Simon started forming a campaign team in March, including John Herrington, former U.S. energy secretary under President Reagan and former chairman of the state Republican Party. 
Of potential primary opponent Jones, Simon said: "He seems like a perfectly nice fellow. ... I just don't think that he provides the contrast to Gray Davis that I do."

POLL: Californians dissatisfied with government handling of energy crisis 

Thursday, May 24, 2001 
?2001 Associated Press

(05-24) 06:22 PDT SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- 
Over the past four months, Californians have developed increasingly negative feelings toward state and federal officials and agencies involved in California's energy crisis, according to a Field Poll released Thursday. 
A large number of those surveyed are also fearful that Pacific Gas & Electric's bankruptcy filing will make it more difficult for the company to provide service to its customers. 
Fifty-seven percent of those questioned in May by the Field Institute, a San Francisco-based nonpartisan polling organization, gave California's private electric utilities a poor rating. That's more than the 40 percent of respondents who rated the utilities performance as poor in January. 
The same negative feelings held true for out-of-state energy providers. Fifty-five percent of respondents this month rated their performance as poor, a noticeable increase from the 44 percent of respondents who gave them a poor rating in January. 
Specifically, those surveyed were asked to rate the job being done by officials and groups working to improve the energy situation in the state. 
The poll found that: 
* The percentage of those surveyed who gave the state Public Utilities Commission a poor rating rose from 42 percent in January to 52 percent in May. 
* 41 percent of those surveyed gave the state legislature a poor rating in May, as opposed 36 percent in January. 
* 38 percent gave Gov. Gray Davis a poor rating in May for his handling of the state's energy woes, a sharp increase from 22 percent who gave him a poor rating in January. 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission also drew negative ratings from respondents. In May, 52 percent said FERC was doing a poor job, as opposed to 40 percent who gave the commission a rating of poor in January. 
Those surveyed were also asked if PG&E's bankruptcy would make it more difficult for the company to supply electricity to customers, and 49 percent said they thought it would. 
The poll, which questioned 1,015 California adults between May 11 and May 20, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points, the institute said.

Energy crisis to cast long shadow 
A look at what energy crisis means to future 
Mark Simon 
Thursday, May 24, 2001 
?2001 San Francisco Chronicle

What we need to do is tune in, turn off and drop out. 
Tune in to how you use energy. Turn off those things that use electricity. And drop out of the power grid by using alternative power sources and alternatives to power sources. 
That's the only thing we can do in the short term. 
In the long term, you can almost see what will be coming down the pike. 
As the state's energy problems worsen, as the state throws its surplus down a rathole, as our own utility bills skyrocket and as blackouts roll across the state, someone will write a statewide ballot initiative and get it on the ballot. 
It will do two things. 
First, it will undo the deregulation of the state's energy industry. It will try to put everything back the way it was. 
Second, it will punish the producers of power and energy. 
It will levy some new fee or tax or it will regulate the industry as a public utility or it will require that the state take over the industry entirely. 
Huge amounts of money will be spent against it. Opponents will outspend supporters by a substantial amount. 
TV ads will run constantly, predicting dire consequences if the initiative is approved. 
We'll be told it will be bad for business. Labor leaders will tell us that it will cost jobs. Experts will say it will have no effect on the problem, or make the problem worse. 
All of that will probably be true. 
The initiative will pass easily. 
It will pass because it will appear to address what are widely understood as the two main causes of the current energy crisis -- a badly bungled deregulation and unbelievably greedy energy producers. 
It will pass because the initiative's authors will understand that most of us are furious about the way this mess was created and that we're eager to take it out on the industry leaders we see as the leading villains. 
It will pass precisely because all the people who will tell us it shouldn't are the people who got us into this disaster in the first place, and we won't believe them. 
It's much harder to say whether the energy crisis will have more immediate political repercussions for some of the elected officials we might blame for the problem -- such as the state Legislature and Gov. Davis, who could have done something about this a year ago and chose not to. 
Yes, the latest polls make it clear that Californians are furious with Davis and the Legislature. 
But elections for office are not yes/no propositions -- you don't get to vote up or down on Davis. 
They are a contest between two major party candidates, which means elections are always a matter of comparisons -- Davis compared with his opponent. Someone has to come along and convince voters he or she can do the job better than Davis. 
There might, indeed, be such people. It's unlikely one of those people will appear on the ballot in 2002, however. 
The current political landscape is heavily populated with profiles in discouragement -- people who, fearful of losing, lack the nerve to run against a well-financed incumbent. 
The great irony here is that voters thought term limits would solve that problem -- rather than being stuck with a well-financed incumbent, we'd force him out of office. 
In reality, we're stuck with the well-financed incumbent until his term limits are up -- in six or eight years. 
That does nothing to solve the problems that might arise in those six to eight years. It has done nothing to embolden would-be candidates. Now, they just meekly wait their turn. 
And it has made a shambles of the legislative process by populating the Capitol with people who don't know what they're doing, only where they're going next. Meanwhile, the people who do know what they're doing have been kicked out office. 
It's no coincidence that the deregulation mess was made in a Legislature full of people elected during the term-limit era. 
A statewide initiative, brave candidates, ending term limits -- those are all things that will happen in the future. 
Right now, it's time to tune in, turn off and drop out. 
Tune in to what you are doing as an individual consumer -- cast a critical eye at your own habits. 
Turn off your appliances, your lights, your air conditioner and reduce your individual energy consumption. It's much easier than it appears. 
Energy consumption has dropped in my household by more than a third by switching off some lights, converting to fluorescent light bulbs, turning down the refrigerator and connecting some appliances to a power strip, so that they truly are turned off. 
Finally, drop out of the power grid. Look for other ways to power your home -- most notably solar power, which is readily available. 
Find other alternatives to high-consumption appliances, such as clotheslines. 
Drop out. 
They can't gouge you if they can't get to you.

Power tips 
Chronicle readers' suggestions for coping with California's energy crisis

I live in Sacramento, where we do use air-conditioning in the summer. I covered two skylights with aluminum foil to keep the heat out. Two east- facing windows have exterior roll-up blinds. . . . I adjusted my pool pump from six hours per day to two hours from 6 to 8 a.m. This saves electricity and puts the usage in the morning, which is not the peak usage. I keep my computer power strip and music/VCR power strip switched off. This alone saves about one kilowatt hour per day. I replaced four of my most used lights with fluorescent bulbs. You really don't need to change all of your bulbs, just the ones that are on for several hours per day. So far, I've cut about one-third of my usage, with very little lifestyle change. 
Martin R. Fraser 
Sacramento 
Household air conditioners are energy guzzlers. Consider, instead, the merits of an evaporative cooler (a.k.a. swamp cooler), ideal in low-humidity locales such as California. They consume only about 25 percent of what it would take to operate an air conditioner. 
Martha Kimmich 
Walnut Creek 
The suggestion that a frost-free refrigerator's compressor will run less if ice cubes are put in Tupperware because it won't waste energy trying to "defrost" trays of ice cubes is pure nonsense. The duration of the defrost cycle is controlled by a timer, which turns on a heater for a fixed duration of time daily. Putting ice in Tupperware will, in fact, prevent the cubes from "evaporating" (technically - sublimating) as they do when left in their trays for long periods, and as such is a good idea - but not because the compressor will run less. 
Jack Petit 
The five major league baseball teams in California need to move to a day- only schedule for the rest of the year. That will also mean no Monday night games for the NFL teams this fall or winter. . . . No more private and public tennis clubs leaving their lights on their courts late into the night. . . . Attempt to combine or limit the venues in which public meetings are held. Often these halls are overly well-lighted, with only a few citizens attending. Reduce hours amusement parks are opened, and reduce the amount of lighting in underused areas. Limit the hours movie theaters are open. The matinees are sparsely attended, but use a lot of power to light and cool the theater. 
Hugh Cavanaugh 
When is San Francisco going to catch up with the rest of America and begin to install high-density sodium vapor lamps (the "yellow light") in place of all of its outside public lighting? They use one-third the energy of "white light" and put out three times the light. Also, if the state would give building owners a tax incentive to install "motion sensor"-controlled lighting systems, all these empty office buildings' lights could safely be shut off at night when these large buildings are empty. 
Rollin W. Roberts 
Require that all businesses keep their doors shut when open for business. One day recently on upper Market Street when it was 55 degrees and windy, I took a tally and 60 percent of the businesses had their doors open. 
Bill Choisser 
San Francisco 
After your dishwasher has completed the wash cycle, open the door, pull out the racks and there will be a big whoosh of steam. The hot temperature of the dishes and glasses themselves (from the wash cycle) creates instant evaporation. In a minute your dishes are dry and cool. The only reason for a drying cycle is because they're enclosed. 
Dan Lucas 
(One reader) wrote she turns off all her large appliances, including TV/VCR,

Davis to order 1-hour notice of blackouts 
Plan also in works to give law enforcement even earlier alerts 
Lynda Gledhill, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau 
Thursday, May 24, 2001 
?2001 San Francisco Chronicle  
URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/05/24/MN2963.DTL&type=news  
Sacramento -- Gov. Gray Davis will issue an executive order today requiring that Californians be given at least one hour's notice before blackouts hit, according to a top administration official. 
The one-hour notice is double what the California Independent System Operator, managers of the state's electrical grid, proposed earlier this week. The ISO board is scheduled to discuss its plan at a meeting today. 
Details of Davis' plan were still being worked out, said the administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. But any plan would have to order the ISO to give more notice of potential blackouts. 
Davis also hopes to give 48-hour and then 24-hour notices of probable blackout scenarios. Administration officials said the two-day notice would go to law enforcement, while everyone would get a 24-hour warning. 
Business groups welcomed the executive order. 
"We need to plan, we need to make adjustments in business schedules," said Jeanne Cain, vice president for government relations for the California Chamber of Commerce. "There are concerns about employee safety issues. The more notice we have, the better we can accommodate the blackout." 
Carl Guardino, an ISO board member and president of the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group, has been pushing for an advanced notification plan and working with the governor. 
"Sixty minutes is twice as good" as 30 minutes, he said. 
With little doubt that blackouts will hit this summer, lawmakers have been searching for a way to make them easier on residents and businesses. 
"As much notice as possible would be helpful. It's helpful to have some advance notice for planning purposes, but small businesses will still be hurt by the blackouts," said Shirley Knight, assistant state director of the National Federation of Independent Business. 
"Most small businesses are in the service sector so they're open during the day, which means small-business owners aren't going to be able to recoup those blackout costs like a manufacturer might be able to," Knight said. 
But one consumer group said Davis should be doing more to stop the blackouts from happening in the first place. 
"It's like saying you're going to know a half hour earlier that an earthquake is coming," said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. "We should be stopping blackouts by standing up to the energy generators, rather than giving us an extra 30 minutes." 
'POWER WATCH' 
The Independent System Operator's proposed plan for forecasting potential blackouts envisions a system that would provide a 24-hour notice of high- demand days. A "Power Watch" would be declared whenever a Stage 1 or Stage 2 alert is likely, while a "Power Warning" would be issued whenever there is at least a 50 percent chance of a Stage 3 alert, when electricity reserves drop below 1.5 percent. 
Until now, the agency has refused to give more than a few minutes' warning of blackouts, saying it did not want to alarm people when there was still a chance that a last-minute purchase of power could stave off blackouts. 
Pacific Gas and Electric Co. said it would welcome the advance notice to be able to notify customers who rely on electricity for life-critical equipment and large businesses. 
"We welcome advance notice from the ISO that would allow us to communicate to customers about pending rotating outages," said Ron Low, a spokesman for 
PG&E.
The public safety aspect must be taken into account, said one consumer group. 
"Blackouts have serious consequences, not just economic," said Mindy Spatt, spokeswoman for The Utility Reform Network in San Francisco. "They create public safety hazards, and all of those issues cannot be addressed from warnings. But knowing in advance is better." 
E-MAIL ALERTS
The ISO also has been working to upgrade its Web site to provide the most current information about how much electricity is being used and how much is available. It will also establish a system this summer through which that information can be sent in an hourly e-mail. 
This information may make it easier for larger users of electricity to plan their operations. 
Enlightening advice to prepare for blackouts Here's some advice from PG&E and local utilities about how to prepare for blackouts: 
-- Have a flashlight and radio with fresh batteries available. If you light candles, observe the usual safety precautions. 
-- If the lights go out, check with neighbors to determine if your home alone is affected. It may be a downed power line or some other problem, in which case you should alert PG&E or your city electrical bureau. 
-- Unplug or turn off all appliances, TVs and computers. Leave one light on to warn you when the power comes back on. 
-- When the power returns, turn one appliance on at a time to prevent power surges. 
-- Don't plug a generator into the wall; when the lights return, it can send a high-voltage current through the system that can electrocute power workers. 
-- Don't open your refrigerator, so your food will remain cold. 
-- Tell children who are home alone to remain calm, turn off the TV and computers and not to use candles.

Californians angry across the board in energy crisis 
Poll rates Bush worse than Davis

Californians are increasingly unhappy with the way Gov. Gray Davis has handled the state's power crunch, but he has plenty of company in their energy doghouse, a Field Poll shows. 
The state's power companies, out-of-state energy providers, President Bush and the Legislature all come out worse than Davis in the survey. 
"Davis' ratings have gone down, but a lot of others are given lower ratings" when people are asked to rank how the politicians and institutions are handling the state's energy situation, said Mark DiCamillo, director of the Field Poll. 
Growing worries about the seriousness of the power problem have sent ratings skidding for anyone connected with the energy business. 
"Everyone has gotten tarred," DiCamillo said. 
A solid 57 percent of those surveyed believe that Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and the state's other private electric utilities have done a poor or very poor job with the energy problem, with out-of-state power providers ranked almost as low. But 54 percent also put Bush's efforts in the poor/very poor category, and 52 percent consigned the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to the same level. 
The growing disdain for the federal energy program probably can be linked with the president's refusal to back limits on energy prices, which are supported by a wide range of California residents, DiCamillo said. 
"To the extent that federal officials are seen as not bending on that issue, " he said, "I suspect that their ratings will continue to be rather dismal." 
The survey showed that Davis has had some success in his attempt to deflect the blame for California's energy woes from his office, but there are indications that that strategy may not work forever. 
Although 41 percent thought the governor was doing a good or very good job with the power crisis in January, that number fell to 27 percent in the new survey. The percentage of residents giving him poor or very poor marks jumped to 38 percent, up from 22 percent in January. 
The survey was conducted May 11 to May 20 of 1,015 California residents. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points. 
In the survey, Californians were quick to congratulate themselves on their own response to the energy problem. The poll showed that 39 percent believe residential energy consumers are doing a good or very good job responding to the problem, up from 26 percent in January. 
"People think they're making an effort to conserve," DiCamillo said. "In the public's eye, it's everyone else that is not doing what they should be doing." 
The survey also shows that the public has few illusions about the seriousness of the energy crunch. More than 80 percent believe it will be a year or more before the energy crisis is resolved, and more than half are convinced it will take at least two years to ensure a steady supply of electricity. 
"The gravity of the situation is such that the public is bracing itself for a long haul," DiCamillo said. "The state hasn't been able to fix the problem in a hurry, and people don't believe it's going to happen." 
The survey also showed that nearly half the state's residents believe that PG&E's bankruptcy will make it harder to continue to supply electricity to its customers while 59 percent say it would be a serious problem if businesses began to leave the state because of the possibility of blackouts. 
Concern about the continuing energy problem was strong across the state, DiCamillo said. 
"This is recognized as a major statewide issue," he said. "People think it will have an effect on them, regardless of where they live."

To encourage Oaklanders to take advantage of renewable energy, the city will waive fees and expedite plans for residents and business owners who want to install solar panels or other alternative energy generators. 
Previously, getting the necessary permits could take as long as eight weeks and cost more than $1,000. 
But under a measure proposed by Mayor Jerry Brown and approved Tuesday night by the Oakland City Council, the design review process will be waived if the equipment installation meets certain requirements, such as matching the pitch of a sloped roof. Permits will be free.

THE ENERGY CRUNCH 
New tips on power squeezing

If you want to wrap yourself in the flag these days, there's no better way than by promoting energy conservation. 
Scientists from the Lawrence Livermore and Lawrence Berkeley national laboratories held a news conference yesterday to highlight new technologies and information sources to help consumers and businesses cut down on electricity use this summer. 
Flanked by tiny models of buildings with white roofs (up to 45 degrees cooler than dark ones), big charts showing U.S. energy flow and an array of "energy vampire" devices such as battery chargers that suck power whenever they're plugged in, earnest researchers discussed ways Californians can reduce their electricity use by 20 percent this summer. 
Meeting the goal has a big payoff, besides the obvious one of averting blackouts: Under the governor's 20/20 Rebate Plan, those who conserve 20 percent this summer compared with the same months last year will not only shave that amount off their bills, but also get an equivalent rebate from the state -- essentially saving 40 percent. 
The technologies were a combination of new twists on humble objects and futuristic geeks-only inventions: 
-- WEB SITES. For folks who want to get a taste of the high-wire act lived every day by California grid operators, energycrisis.lbl.gov  gives real-time data on the current supply and demand for electricity in the state. When you see the purple line (forecast load) start to hover near the red line (potential capacity), you know it's time to turn off the lights and hit the Save button. 
Lawrence Berkeley Lab is sponsoring three Web pages -- savepower.lbl.gov , HomeEnergySaver.lbl.gov  and HomeImprovementTool.lbl.gov  -- that offer customized conservation tips based on the user's climate and type of house -- saving 8 percent by using clotheslines instead of a dryer, for example. 
-- LAMPS. Lawrence Berkeley scientists have created the eponymous "Berkeley lamp," expected to go on sale in July for under $150. It's a high-performance table lamp with two fluorescent bulbs that together use less than 110 watts, but provide light equivalent to 300 or 400 watts. The lamp provides both "uplight," for illuminating an entire room, and "downlight," for close tasks such as reading. To be manufactured by Light Corp. of Minnesota, it will be sold through the company's Web site at www.lightcorp.com . 
Another, existing lamp -- a floor-standing torchere that uses compact fluorescent bulbs instead of halogen bulbs -- is widely available in hardware and lighting stores from a variety of manufacturers. 
-- WINDOWS. "Low-emissivity" windows look as transparent as regular glass but reflect infrared light, reducing heat transmission. The technology is now available in about 40 percent of windows sold. Consumers can recognize energy- efficient windows by a government "Energy Star" label; more information is available at www.efficientwindows.org . 
-- SCI-FI CHANNEL. At Lawrence Livermore Lab, scientists have been working on technology that's not for average users, but could eventually bring us up to date with the Jetsons. 
Technologies include electromechanical (flywheel) batteries, which can bridge the gap when the power goes off, thereby protecting sensitive electronic equipment. 
Then there are solid oxide fuel cells, which produce energy from fuel without using combustion -- a technology of the future, both for vehicles and stationary power. 
The Livermore researchers are also studying ways to make geothermal energy (which accounts for 6 percent of California's supply) more efficient and methods to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions from diesel generators. 
Further out, scientists hope to be able to store electricity, so energy from wind farms, for example, could be used at the times it's needed the most, instead of only when the weather cooperates.

House panel calls off vote on Calif power bill WASHINGTON, (Reuters) - The U.S. Energy and Commerce Committee has called off, at least temporarily, a vote on legislation to aid California and other states during this summer's expected electricity shortage.  Rep. Billy Tauzin, the Louisiana Republican chairman of the committee, said lawmakers needed more time to seek a bipartisan deal to get agreement on immediate help for power-starved California and the West.  ``We may be on the verge of a very solid bipartisan agreement,'' Tauzin said.  He hoped that talks on Thursday would allow a vote on the pending legislation as early as today.  The legislation was written by Republicans to reduce demand and encourage more supply of power in California this summer. Many Democrats on the committee objected to the bill, saying it needed a provision to cap wholesale prices in the entire Western region or else it fails to help the situation.  Republican lawmakers, along with the Bush administration, strongly oppose price controls.	








Davis proposal for more diesel power draws environmental criticism LOS ANGELES (AP) -- California would get a little power and a lot of pollution from a proposal being considered by Gov. Gray Davis that would pay owners of backup generators to produce electricity.  The proposal, one of several options the governor is considering, would pay for diesel power -- which at its dirtiest is 500 times more polluting than the cleanest natural gas power plants -- when electricity supplies are stretched.  ``If backup generators were to be used, it would only be as a last resort to avoid blackouts,'' said Davis spokesman Roger Salazar. ``Unfortunately, we are in an emergency situation. Everything is on the table.''  California's persistent power shortage has led to rolling blackouts around the state several times this year, with more anticipated when hot summer weather prompts people to use air conditioning.  If all of the state's backup generators ran full time, they would produce about 425 tons of nitrogen dioxide per day. That's more than nine times the pollution power plants produced on an average day in 1999, according to state Air Resources Board data.  And the state would get only about 550 megawatts of electricity -- barely 1 percent of the state's peak power needs -- from the backup generators. That would be enough to power about 550,000 homes.  ``They could have a huge negative effect on air quality,'' said Ellen Garvey, executive officer for the Bay Area Air Quality Management Agency. ``It's one thing to run these generators during blackouts and emergency conditions, but using them for other purposes could be devastating.''  Business groups that support the proposal include the League of Food Processors, the California Manufacturers and Technology Association and San Diego Gas & Electric.  ``These generators could go a long way to taking some demand off the electric grid and putting some supply back into the power system,'' said Gino DiCaro, spokesman for the manufacturers and technology association.  Most of the state's 17,200 backup generators are small units that run on diesel fuel and lack pollution controls. Some are rentals, and others can be found at hospitals, office buildings, sewage treatment plants and university labs.  Unlike backup generators intended for home use, which are not regulated, industrial-sized units are limited in the number of hours they can operate. But since the state's power crunch began, regional air-quality regulators have issued emergency rules allowing them to run more frequently.  Diesel engines produce carcinogenic soot and oxides of nitrogen -- a building block of asthma-inducing smog.	










   Small generators fight for payment from utilities  Posted at 11:24 p.m. PDT Wednesday, May 23, 2001  BY JENNIFER BJORHUS   Mercury News    BAKERSFIELD -- A gray cat picks its way through the lot of Oildale Energy, a small natural gas-fired power plant on the city's gritty northeast edge. The clamor of machinery and trucks -- sounds that meant prosperity here -- is gone. Employees have painted Oildale's machinery, insulated the boilers and tweaked the motionless 13-ton turbine.  Now they wait.  ``It's kind of like a skeleton,'' says plant manager Mike Pankratz, surveying the octopus-tangle of pipes and tanks.  Choked by the $10 million Pacific Gas & Electric Co. owes it, Oildale shut down Feb. 6, taking its 40 megawatts of badly needed electricity with it. The hush here is the sound of small generators locked in one of the most serious issues of California's energy crisis -- one that state regulators plan to wrestle with today.  Oildale is part of a growing legion of small generators, from geothermal to gas-fired co-generation plants, battling California's utilities and state price controls they say are crippling them. These small generators, owed about $1.5 billion, supply up to a third of California's electricity.  At least 25 have sued Southern California Edison over unpaid bills. Four have sued PG&E. And PG&E's bankruptcy proceedings in San Francisco are clogged with motions from at least 19 small generators, including Oildale. In many cases, these companies want to end their long-term supply contracts with the utilities so they can sell their electricity on the more lucrative open market.  ``What this is, basically, is the revolt of the mice,'' said Bill Short with Ridgewood Power Management, a New Jersey firm that has shuttered three gas-fired generators in California and sued PG&E.  Officials to weigh debt  The companies are hoping for action from the California Public Utilities Commission, which is scheduled today to weigh whether to order the utilities to pay the back debt. Meanwhile, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali wades through motions filed by disgruntled generators and counter motions from PG&E.  The deteriorating finances of some of the approximately 690 small generators threatens California's fragile power supply just as the state heads into the summer months up to 3,700 megawatts short.  The deep and often unexpected economic impacts of California's energy crunch add up daily. In Oildale's case, the shutdown not only jeopardizes the jobs of its 10 anxious employees, but those of more than 150 employees at the refinery next door.  It's one of the biggest public policy botches in the energy crisis, some energy experts argue. California is shooting itself in the foot by not attending to the relatively clean and efficient small power suppliers in its own back yard, they say. Gas-fired co-generation plants, which provide power to nearby businesses and sell electricity to utilities, are some of the most efficient producers in the state. And many of the small generators harness renewable resources like the sun and garbage fumes, lessening the state's dependence on high-priced natural gas.  ``The idea that we're refusing to step in and help them while we're paying through the nose to pay Dynegy and Williams and everybody else, this is just nuts,'' said Severin Borenstein, director of the University of California Energy Institute, mentioning companies that own major power plants in the state. ``This is really a major blunder.''  The immediate crisis started in late January, Oildale's Pankratz explained. That's when PG&E told the plant it was not going to pay for electricity delivered in December. The news worried Oildale's gas supplier, Pankratz said, which halted the plant's supply.  Pankratz turned off the plant's turbine.  The move socked Golden Bear Oil Specialties, the refinery that looms over Oildale. Unable to operate without the cheap steam heat Oildale supplies, Golden Bear cannot heat the asphalt and industrial oils it produces. Golden Bear filed for bankruptcy April 23. Last week it announced plans to lay off 172 employees.  Golden Bear Chairman Carl Soderlind said Oildale, Golden Bear's exclusive source of steam heat for nearly 20 years, was a key reason his group bought the refinery four years ago. Having it go under was ``gut-wrenching,'' he said.  Power unavailable  The California Independent System Operator, keeper of the state's electricity grid, reports that 1,400 megawatts of power from small generators are off line. It estimates that about half of that -- 700 megawatts, or energy for as many as 700,000 homes -- is due to the financial squeeze of natural gas prices, money owed by the utilities or both. Others say financial problems have 1,100 megawatts off line.  Lawmakers haven't been much help. The state Assembly on March 22 rejected a hastily crafted rescue bill meant to help buttress these companies. The issue has languished in Sacramento.  Days later, the utilities commission ordered California's utilities to pay the generators for electricity delivered in the future -- which saved many of them -- but it did not order the utilities to pay the hefty back-due amounts. It also set a new rate for what utilities should pay the generators for electricity. That price is 22 percent lower and too low for business, some argue.  The commission's position has been that the small generators should abide by their existing contracts, said commission attorney Gary Cohen: ``To the extent that some of them are facing financial hardship, the commission may take a look at whether it can do anything to help them vis-a-vis the back debt.''  The lack of stronger action to support these generators baffles some critics.  ``It's like talking to a starving man on a desert island and saying, `How long can you hold up until the ship comes?' '' said V. John White, director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies.  Some of the companies have appealed to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, but regulators are waiting to see if the state and the courts can resolve the issue.  ``We're in what essentially amounts to an abusive relationship,'' said Short with Ridgewood, the independent generator that has sued PG&E.  Two courts have allowed generators fighting Edison to suspend their contracts. Five have lost their fights. Another five have won the right to put a lien on Edison's assets.  In PG&E's battle, three of the four lawsuits are on hold because of the bankruptcy. In the fourth, a judge allowed a generator out of the contract it had terminated before the bankruptcy.  As for Oildale, it wants PG&E to pay the $10.5 million it owes or Oildale wants to sell its electricity on the open market. It also wants PG&E to pay what it calls ``a fair market value'' for its electricity.  If Oildale can't sell on the open market soon, it will be forced into bankruptcy, its attorneys argue. Pankratz estimates his plant can hang in limbo only three more months.  PG&E is fighting to keep its small generators, which it says are exaggerating their damage. It reports that only a tiny fraction of its 300 generators are off line.  Increased costs  If the plants were released from their contracts, PG&E could not afford to pay the extra $284 million per month it estimates electricity would cost. The state Department of Water Resources -- and ultimately ratepayers -- would have to foot that bill.  A fast solution isn't likely from the bankruptcy court. The judge has made it clear the generators raise a host of complicated legal questions.  Meanwhile, the clock ticks.  ``We've all been a little tense,'' says Judy Andreatta, who has worked Oildale's front desk for 10 years and worries about her job. ``It's just so scary watching everything happen. Who'd ever think we'd lose power?'' 	








      Electricity notebook  FERC may renew price caps  May 24, 2001  From Register wire services  Federal regulators this week announced that they might reimpose caps on the cost of transporting natural gas into southern California.  The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Tuesday gave the public 20 days to comment on the possibility of reinstating caps, which were temporarily suspended by the commission this year. The price controls were lifted in an effort to expand the reach of deregulation.  This proposed action, said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., "could make a real difference."  "Since FERC engaged in this experimental lifting of the cap, the price of natural gas in Southern California has climbed to three times higher than the rest of the nation,'' said Feinstein. Currently, she said, the price in Southern California is $12.59 per million British Thermal Units and only $3.70 in the rest of the Western region. Gas fuels most electricity-generating plants in the state.  The commission also asked for comment on whether the caps should be limited to California or include other Western markets.   	







      Legislators search for a Plan B for Edison  Davis' tack is politically volatile. The aim still is to steer clear of bankruptcy.  May 24, 2001  By HANH KIM QUACH  and KATE BERRY The Orange County Register  SACRAMENTO Lawmakers this week will seek to swap the deal Gov. Gray Davis made to rescue the state's No. 2 utility from financial ruin with something more politically palatable.  Davis' deal, some have complained, is sweeter for Southern California Edison than for taxpayers. So at least four proposals are being floated to supplant that plan. But legislators are far from a consensus on any of them. Plans emerge, recede and are reconfigured daily.  Energy experts and bankruptcy lawyers warn that too much legislative fiddling could result in what neither side wants: bankruptcy for Edison.  Bankruptcy means the state would be stuck buying energy until both Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric - which is already in bankruptcy - complete the Chapter 11 process, which could take years, experts and lawmakers said.  The state's wallet would shrink, affecting its ability to build schools and roads. Ratepayers might be on the hook for an additional $1 billion for the company's legal fees, because bankruptcy would freeze its assets, said Brian Bennett, vice president of Edison International, the utility's parent company.  Southern California Edison has said it's willing to be flexible on the governor's plan, which calls for the state to buy Edison's transmission grid for $2.76 billion. Company officials wouldn't comment on the various alternatives.  "We understand that the transmission deal is the subject of controversy and are open to variations on it,'' Bennett said.  Steve Maviglio, Davis' spokesman, said the governor also remained committed to his deal.  "Edison is going to survive,'' said Mitch Wilk, a member of the state Public Utilities Commission from 1986 through 1991 and a past president of the agency. But the question is "whether it will survive via the (plan) that the governor negotiated or they do the same kind of thing PG&E did."  "There is still a very real risk that SCE will be forced into bankruptcy if the Legislature tinkers too much with the deal, or fails to move ahead promptly,'' Wilk said.  PG&E chose to file Chapter 11 last month because it was dissatisfied with the progress of negotiations with Davis on a state rescue of the company. PG&E's move was an embarrassment for Davis, who had vowed to keep the state's big utilities solvent.  "One of the principal chips Edison has with the state is not filing for bankruptcy,'' said Ed Feo, a lawyer involved with the PG&E case. "It would be a black eye for the state. As long as the company stays out of bankruptcy, they have something to trade."  Edison's creditors are still waiting to see how the utility fares with the Legislature. Some have agreed to defer receiving payments until the end of June.  Dean Vanech, president of New Jersey-based Carson Cogeneration, said a lot of things need to happen before he and other creditors feel ready to drag Edison into bankruptcy.  "In general, we would have to feel like there was absolutely no hope in a deal being made,'' Vanech said. But, he admitted, "there's a concern that a resolution will not be put on the table in any reasonable period of time.''Meanwhile, Edison has vigorously lobbied the Legislature to approve the transmission deal. The company has launched a public-relations campaign to persuade the public that it is in its interest, said John Bryson, chief executive of Edison International.  "Bankruptcy is a last resort,'' Bryson said in a recent interview. "We believe there will be a solution.''  But changes are necessary, said Senate Leader John Burton, D-San Francisco, "because people didn't like Plan A.''  Lawmakers cringed at some elements of the plan, which many thought was overly generous to Edison: limiting investigation of the utility's parent's company and guaranteeing the company an 11.6 percent annual return on investment.  Alternatives include: requiring power generators to accept up to one-third less than the collective $3.5 billion they're owed; taxing Edison on its property and using the tax to pay off its debts; and allowing Edison to build more power plants. The latest proposal would require the state to sell bonds to pay off Edison's debts and give the state the option to buy the transmission lines later. Most of the proposals would require an extra surcharge on ratepayers bills to pay off debts.  One hurdle the legislature faces: rallying two-thirds of each house behind one plan, necessary any time the state spends money. Republicans have been philosophically opposed to acquiring transmission lines, and half the alternatives include that element.  But Stanford University professor James Sweeney thinks compromise is possible. Lawmakers and the utility will strike a deal simply because a second bankruptcy would tarnish the image of the state's political leaders. Sweeney believes, however, the outcome might be more fair in court.  "Bankruptcies are messy ... but so is the political process,'' Sweeney said. "We're in a situation where the leadership (politically) seems not willing to bite the bullet. It may be better for our state to have a bankruptcy judge who is very strong and who isn't planning for a higher office.''   	








      Long Beach obtains lien on Edison's assets  The city is the fourth small supplier with an attachment on the utility.  May 24, 2001  By KATE BERRY The Orange County Register  The city of Long Beach became the fourth small power supplier to get a lien against the assets of Southern California Edison, a move that could push the utility closer to bankruptcy.  Last week, Edison was ordered to freeze at least $9 million in bank accounts to cover payments owed to Long Beach for power Edison bought from the city's trash-to-energy plant.  Getting a lien on the utility's assets ensures the city will be paid, even if the utility files for bankruptcy.  Stephen Pickett, Edison International's general counsel, said the utility plans to appeal.  Long Beach also is suing Edison International, the utility's parent company, for breach of contract, claiming the utility should not have transferred $4.7 billion to its parent company over a four-year period beginning in 1996, when deregulation was implemented.  "Edison International was required to honor the debts of its subsidiary,'' said Robert Shannon, Long Beach's city attorney.  So far, Edison has been sued by 27 small power suppliers, known as qualifying facilities, or QFs. The lawsuits either seek to put a lien on the utility's assets to recover unpaid debts or attempt to terminate 20-year contracts to provide power to Edison.  Edison owes QFs about $1 billion and is trying to combine the cases before a single judge in Los Angeles.  But Long Beach differs from other power suppliers because it wants to stay in its contract with Edison.  "We just want to be paid under our contract. We still want to deliver them power,'' said Shannon.  As a municipality, Long Beach also did not have to post a bond to obtain a lien as the other QFs must.  Ed Feo, a lawyer for wind, solar and biomass QFs, said liens on Edison's assets could have a domino effect.  "Two things will accelerate a bankruptcy filing by Edison: Either the deal to sell its transmission lines (to the state) is going nowhere and alternatives are not acceptable - or if attachments are made to the company's property that the utility doesn't want to run the risk of losing.''  Three other QFs have posted bonds to obtain liens against Edison. They include Caithness Energy, which got a lien on Edison's 56 percent interest in two qualifying facilities that make up the Mohave Generating Station in Laughlin, Nev.; IMC Chemicals, a unit of IMC Global Inc. of Northbrook, Ill., and that won a $7 million lien; and Herber Geothermal Co. and Second Imperial Geothermal Co., which is owned by Covanta Energy Corp., a former unit of Ogden Corp., based in Fairfield, N.J.   	







      Poll: 59% in state favor nuclear power  It's a reversal of views since the Three Mile Island accident.  May 24, 2001   The Associated Press  Fifty-nine percent of Californians now support building more nuclear plants, according to a poll released Wednesday.  The last time the Field Institute polled Californians about nuclear energy was 1984 - five years after the accident at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania - and it found 61 percent opposed to nuclear power.  "In my interpretation, the current energy crisis has some bearing on the public's changed attitudes on nuclear power," said Mark DiCamillo, spokesman for the nonpartisan polling organization.  "The public is searching for clean ways to add to the capacity."  The Field poll comes as the Bush administration pushes for a renewed look at nuclear power. No utilities have ordered any new nuclear power plants in the United States since 1978.  The poll of 1,015 California adults was taken May 11-20. The margin of error was plus or minus 3.2 percent.  Carl Zichella, the Sierra Club's regional staff director, said Californians have not thought about nuclear energy for about 20 years and do not have as much information as they did around Three Mile Island.  "I think this number really reflects a lack of knowledge on the part of the public about the problems that drove nuclear power underground," he said.  "The more people know about nuclear power, the less they're going to like it."  Getting a new nuclear plant built faces two major problems: financing and siting, said Rich Ferguson, research director for the Sacramento- based Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technology.  "We have just not seen any interest in the financial community to invest the billions of dollars," he said.   	





Filing for Hayward Project Includes Request for Expedited Review


PLEASANTON, Calif., May 23 /PRNewswire/ -- San Jose-based, Calpine
Corporation (NYSE: CPN) and San Francisco-based, Bechtel Enterprises Holdings,
Inc. today filed an Application For Certification (AFC) with the California
Energy Commission (CEC) for its proposed Russell City Energy Center in
Hayward, Calif.  The filing marks the beginning of an extensive CEC licensing
process required to build and operate an electricity generating facility in
California.  The filing included a request for expedited review that would
reduce the licensing review process period from 12 months to 6 months.


The proposed Russell City Energy Center would be a 600-megawatt, natural
gas-fired, combined-cycle electric generating facility located on
approximately 14 acres of land, zoned heavy industrial, at 3636 Enterprise
Avenue in Hayward.  The site is adjacent to the city of Hayward's wastewater
treatment plant, which would supply recycled water to the Energy Center. The
Russell City Energy Center would provide needed electricity for Hayward,
western Alameda County and the San Francisco Peninsula.


The modern technology used at the facility would allow for a greater than
90 percent reduction of certain emissions and is 40 percent more
fuel-efficient compared to older gas-fueled facilities in the Bay Area.


"The Russell City Energy Center will provide a vital new source of clean,
reliable electricity in the region," said Curt Hildebrand, vice president and
general manager of the Calpine/Bechtel Joint Development.  "We look forward to
working with the City of Hayward, Alameda County and the California Energy
Commission to develop a model Energy Center."


Submittal of the AFC represents the culmination of more than six months of
extensive engineering, technical and environmental studies.


"We are hopeful that the considerable groundwork that we have laid thus
far will make this project eligible for the six month CEC review process,"
Hildebrand added.  "We are seeking the expedited review to do everything we
can to help solve the state's energy crisis as quickly as possible."


Once the CEC determines that the application is complete, and determine
whether the project qualifies for the expedited review process, the official
review will begin.  As lead agency, the CEC will work with environmental and
government agencies in conducting its review and will hold local workshops and
hearings to encourage community participation. The expedited review process
would require the same environmental and technical standards as the longer
review period.  Based upon the successful licensing of the project,
construction could begin in summer of 2002, with commercial operation by
summer of 2004.


Copies of the AFC filings will be available through the CEC and at local
libraries. Summaries of the study will be posted on the Russell City Energy
Center website (www.russellcityenergycenter.com).  To receive additional
information on the CEC process, visit their website at www.energy.ca.gov.  For
more information on the Russell City Energy Center, call 510-704-8475.

California Governor Signs Bill to Speed Up Approval for Power Plants



LOS ANGELES, May 22, 2001 (Xinhua via COMTEX) -- Governor of California Gray
Davis on Tuesday signed a bill to speed up the process of approving construction
of new power plants as a way to fight the ongoing power shortage.

"California is in a war with energy producers, and the best long-term weapon is
to build more power plants," Davis said at a signing ceremony in Elk Grove,
California.


The bill will shorten the application process for a new or remodeled power
plant, as well as the time that local governments have to review proposals.


Davis said the new bill will speed up two energy projects that are in the
process right now, including a 900-megawatt plant in Palm Springs and a gas
storage project in Lodi that will store up to 12 billion cubic feet of natural
gas.


California has been suffering from a power crisis since last year, which has
caused repeated blackouts and sent the power rate spiraling.


The crisis is largely blamed on the 1996 deregulation law that forces the
utilities to buy electricity from the wholesale market at higher rates than they
charge the customers. And the repairs of generators in some power plants and the
warming weather have made things worse.


After the heavily indebted utilities could no longer afford to buying power
anymore, the state government has used more than 7 billion dollars of tax money
so far this year to buy electricity on behalf of them.


Among other measures to ease the power shortage, the state government has called
for residents to conserve electricity as much as they can, especially during the
peak-hours during the day.Residents have been told to brace for a worse
situation during the incoming summer.

Lockyer: Probe may spark suit 
Criminal charges could follow evidence of price gouging 
By Steve Geissinger
SACRAMENTO BUREAU 
SACRAMENTO -- State Attorney General Bill Lockyer said Wednesday his investigation of alleged multibillion-dollar price gouging by power generators has laid the foundation for a successful civil case that could win huge refunds. 
"But the whole house hasn't been built," Lockyer said in an interview with ANG Newspapers. 
The attorney general said the probe he expects to complete in the next eight weeks also may yet yield criminal charges, which could result in power company officials being locked up "with my tattooed dude." 
Lockyer, a former East Bay legislator, rattled electricity suppliers earlier this week when he told the Wall Street Journal: "I would love to personally escort (Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth) Lay to an 8 x 10 cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says, 'Hi, my name is Spike, honey.'" 
Houston-based Enron, like other energy-trading firms, has denied wrongdoing in the California market. It dismissed Lockyer's comment as not warranting a response butquietlyprotested to the Davis administration. Other power companies have expressed outrage. 
"I was trying to convey a message to ... the out-of-state energy generators," Lockyer said. "I decided to make the point with the energy generators that they've got a serious fight on their hands." 
The attorney general, however, conceded he has "felt guilty about it ever since because I'm a prosecutor and I take pride in being careful about these sorts of accusations or claims." 
"But I know it won't be in print unless I find some sort of colorful way to ... pump up the rhetoric," he said. 
"We don't care if they're multi-millionaires. We don't care if they run big corporations. They're buccaneers. They're ripping us off. 
"Now, while we're still in the legal analysis of whether it's legal or illegal greed, it's clearly immoral. There's no debate about that." 
Lockyer said his investigators are scrutinizing tens of thousands of transactions and hundreds of thousands of documents to determine the strength of the state's case. 
"I think there is strong evidence that lays the foundation for a successful civil action, but the whole house hasn't been built," Lockyer said. 
A civil case could result in refunds that "disgorge the obscene profits," he said. 
The California Independent System Operator, which manages the state's electric transmission grid, estimates that power suppliers may have overcharged California by $6.8 billion since early last year. 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has so far tentatively ordered California suppliers to make only tens of millions of dollars in refunds as part of that agency's ongoing probe. 
Lockyer said criminal charges will be filed if investigators find that company officials intentionally engaged in unfair business practices. 
The attorney general said he hopes to complete the work within the next eight weeks despite what he called stalling tactics such as those by three energy firms -- Reliant and Dynegy of Houston and Mirant of Atlanta. 
The three companies agreed Tuesday to surrender copies of internal documents that had been subpoenaed two months ago by Lockyer as part of the probe. 
"They've been throwing $500-an-hour lawyers at us in high volume to drag their feet and stall our investigation," Lockyer said. 
The attorney general's comments come amid a flurry of lawsuits and allegations by California officials against power suppliers, as well as ongoing probes. 
Besides the attorney and FERC, the Legislature, state Public Utilities Commission, Cal-ISO and the California Electricity Oversight Board are all conducting investigations.

Davis to push backup diesel
By Chris Bowman
Bee Staff Writer
(Published May 24, 2001) 
In a major reversal of environmental policy, Gov. Gray Davis will announce a 
plan to relieve California's overloaded electricity grid this summer by 
paying businesses to run their high-polluting backup generators in advance of 
anticipated blackouts, a top energy adviser to the governor said Wednesday. 
"The backup generators will help us get through the summer," said S. David 
Freeman, who recently resigned as general manager of the Los Angeles 
Department of Water and Power to lead Davis' drive for energy conservation. 
Freeman said he would leave it to Davis to disclose details of the plan. 
"The governor will announce what he's going to do," he said Wednesday in a 
wide-ranging interview on energy issues with The Bee. 
Roger Salazar, the governor's deputy press secretary, would not confirm when 
or whether Davis would make such an announcement. 
"I don't know that the governor has signed off on anything like that," 
Salazar said. 
Under the plan, participating businesses would turn on backup generators and 
simultaneously disconnect from the electricity grid when power supplies are 
at Stage 3 -- nearly depleted. 
The state would pay the companies for the much-needed power that would be 
saved by converting to diesel generation. 
Deploying diesel-powered generators -- the dirtiest of internal combustion 
engines -- to forestall blackouts is another sign of the governor's struggle 
to get more megawatts flowing through California. 
Earlier this week Davis lowered his estimate of the amount of new power that 
will come on line this summer from 5,000 megawatts to 4,000 megawatts. A 
megawatt is enough power for 750 to 1,000 households. 
The diesel plan also marks a significant turnabout in the Davis 
administration's policy. 
The governor and his appointees at the state Air Resources Board uniformly 
have rejected such proposals from industries, utilities and the operator of 
the state's electricity grid, arguing that routine use of the backup diesels 
would endanger public health. 
San Diego Gas & Electric has one such proposal scheduled for a vote today by 
the Davis-appointed state Public Utilities Commission. 
Environmentalists who have been catching word of the Davis plan this week 
argue that it would shatter the governor's repeated promises to stand firm on 
air quality standards during the energy crisis. 
A letter signed Wednesday by several of the state's leading environmental 
organizations, including the American Lung Association of California, urged 
Davis to reconsider. 
"Given your awareness of the public health threats of diesel emissions, 
please stop and have these proposals considered in a more thoughtful and 
public manner," the letter states. 
Freeman argued, however, that the additional health threat from non-emergency 
use of diesel generators is "marginal" compared with the health and safety 
problems triggered by power outages. 
"This is a no-brainer," Freeman said. "You've got human lives at stake here. 
This is a scary situation." 
Freeman cited, for example, people on life-support systems that could go awry 
in blackouts. 
But Sandra Spelliscy, attorney for the environmentalist Planning and 
Conservation League, countered, "If the health impacts are so marginal, why 
has the governor's own air quality enforcement agency opposed this?" 
Industries ranging from hospitals to food processing plants and data 
management centers have diesel-powered generators -- some the size of 
locomotives -- that kick on when a storm or earthquake knocks out power. 
Unlike diesel-powered trucks and buses, most diesel standby generators run 
with little or no pollution controls because they are intended only for 
emergencies. 
Though the latest models run cleaner and more efficiently, most generators in 
use today produce about 500 times more emissions of smog-forming nitrogen 
oxides per megawatt-hour as a new natural gas-fired power plant, according to 
air board engineers. Further, the diesels spew high amounts of breathable 
soot particles that can cause cancer, the engineers say. 
Davis' plan would limit the use of the generators to days when the grid 
operator declares a Stage 3 alert, meaning the power supplies are running low 
and rolling blackouts may be ordered to keep the state's entire grid from 
collapsing, according to Freeman. 
Salazar, the governor's spokesman, said only, "Any backup generation 
involving diesel will have to be used as a last resort to prevent blackouts." 
Environmentalists who are trying to head off the plan said it would have the 
state paying participating businesses at least 35 cents per kilowatt-hour, 
roughly three times the rate consumers typically pay for electricity. Freeman 
would not confirm the pay rate. 
The Davis administration has offered generators willing to sell new power 
exclusively to the state 50 percent discounts on the air emission credits 
they would need to comply with smog rules. 
For operators of existing power plants, the governor has agreed to have 
taxpayers pay the entire cost of polluting above allowable limits in order to 
keep the lights on. 
The latest plan to pay companies to run the dirty diesels during energy 
alerts further loosens the environmental reins.

Bush-Davis meeting set for energy crisis
By David Whitney
Bee Washington Bureau
(Published May 24, 2001) 
WASHINGTON -- President Bush will meet next week with Gov. Gray Davis to talk 
about California's worsening electricity crisis amid a shifting political 
dynamic on Capitol Hill that increasingly favors some controls on West Coast 
wholesale electricity prices. 
Details for the Bush-Davis meeting were still being worked out Wednesday, but 
the fact that the Republican president is meeting with the Democratic 
governor, who is often mentioned as a possible challenger in 2004, was seen 
as a sign that the White House is facing increasing political heat on the 
energy issue. 
"California is a very big state," said White House spokesman Ari Fleischer. 
"It represents one-sixth of the United States. It's the sixth-largest economy 
in the world. And the president is very pleased to sit and talk with Governor 
Davis. It's important." 
Davis' spokesman, Steve Maviglio, said electricity price caps will be at the 
top of the governor's agenda for the meeting on Tuesday or Wednesday. But 
Fleischer did not commit the president to that kind of meeting. 
In his first visit to the state since the campaign last year, the president 
will spend Monday night in Los Angeles and Tuesday night in Fresno. 
Until now, the White House has steadfastly refused to meet with any elected 
Democrat from California about the energy crisis despite repeated pleas from 
the Democratic congressional delegation. 
Price controls have become the mantra of California Democratic lawmakers and 
a handful of Republicans, but the Bush administration has flatly dismissed 
them as counterproductive to increasing power generation in the 
megawatt-short state. 
In recent weeks, however, there has been a developing shift in the attitude 
toward price controls on Capitol Hill. Bush's two nominees to the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission, whose names were forwarded to the Senate floor 
Wednesday for confirmation, declined to rule out price controls once they are 
seated on the panel. 
And the apparent decision by Vermont Sen. James Jeffords to abandon the 
Republican Party would put Democrats in control of the Senate, moving Sen. 
Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico, a price-control advocate, to the helm of the key 
Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. 
California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a committee Democrat, said Wednesday that 
she has talked to Bingaman and that he committed to moving her legislation to 
temporarily peg wholesale prices to the cost of production. 
Four Republican House members from California have also endorsed some form of 
price-control legislation. 
On Wednesday, Rep. Doug Ose, R-Sacramento, announced that he is introducing a 
bill that, while not technically a price cap, would give greater price relief 
for West Coast consumers than federal regulators or the Bush administration 
have been willing to offer. 
Ose, chairman of the House Government Reform Committee's energy subcommittee, 
said his bill would extend throughout the West a price-mitigation plan 
approved last month by the FERC. But instead of that plan taking effect only 
during power emergencies as the commission directed, it would operate around 
the clock under Ose's bill to peg spot market prices at the cost of 
production of the least-efficient plant selling into the California market. 
Ose said his bill would encourage generators to sell their power through 
long-term contracts rather than on the volatile spot market. 
"I am looking for a middle ground," Ose said.

Energy Digest: GOP unveils plan to help utility
By Jim Sanders
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published May 24, 2001) 
State Assembly efforts to develop a bipartisan proposal to help Southern 
California Edison pay off massive debts and avoid bankruptcy hit a dead end 
Wednesday when Republicans released a plan of their own. 
The move could force Democrats to sidestep Republicans and vote along party 
lines on an alternative to Gov. Gray Davis' proposed $2.76 billion state 
purchase of power lines. 
Assembly Republican leader Dave Cox of Fair Oaks said Wednesday's split was 
necessary because there are few differences between the governor's plan and 
the Democrats' plan. 
The Republican plan rejects the notion of purchasing transmission lines or 
hydroelectric facilities. 
Key components call for dedicating a portion of consumer rates to allow 
Edison to pay off $3.5 billion in debts. In return, ratepayers would receive 
either an equity stake in future power plants or the right to purchase 
electricity at discount rates.






Few escape blame for crisis in poll
By Dan Smith
Bee Deputy Capitol Bureau Chief
(Published May 24, 2001) 
Utility companies and out-of-state power generators continue to get the 
lowest marks for their performance in California's energy crisis, but Gov. 
Gray Davis' grades have slipped dramatically over the past five months, 
according to a Field Poll released Wednesday. 
And Californians, it turns out, blame plenty of people for the state's power 
woes -- except themselves. 
Every player in the power drama gets poor marks except "residential energy 
consumers," which 39 percent of poll respondents say are doing a good or very 
good job to improve the energy situation. Only 22 percent think they are 
doing a poor or very poor job. 
Public opinion of residential consumers' efforts has improved since January, 
when 32 percent thought they were doing a poor job and only 26 percent gave 
them high marks. 
"The public sees themselves as conserving energy," said Field Poll Director 
Mark DiCamillo. "That's the only positive movement in the survey." 
For Davis, who faces re-election next year, the movement is far from 
positive. 
In the January poll, the Democratic governor received good marks from 41 
percent of those surveyed, average grades from 31 percent and poor ratings 
from only 22 percent. 
But when the Field Institute conducted its recent poll between May 11 and 
Sunday, opinions about Davis flip-flopped. After months of energy angst, a 
handful of power blackouts and two rate increases, only 27 percent think 
Davis is doing a good job, while 38 percent gave him failing grades. The poll 
also shows that Californians believe the crisis will continue by an average 
of a year and a half, well through the upcoming re-election battle. 
"All the rhetoric Davis used with some positive effect early on is not going 
over well any more," DiCamillo said. "The public is starting to view this as 
a long-term problem, not some temporary policy shift." 
Still, Davis fares far better than his adversaries in the crisis -- President 
Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney and the energy industry. 
The public's view of energy interests, which was pretty dim in January, drops 
even lower in the May poll. Utility companies received bad ratings from half 
the public in January, but 57 percent now believe they are doing a poor or 
very poor job. Out-of-state energy generators, whom Davis has accused of 
gouging ratepayers, fell from 44 percent low ratings in January to 55 percent 
in the May poll. 
Bush, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the state Public Utilities 
Commission are not far behind, drawing poor grades from more than half the 
public. Cheney, the architect of Bush's energy proposal, received low ratings 
from 43 percent. The January Field Poll did not ask about Bush and Cheney 
because they had not yet taken office. 
Davis has repeatedly bashed FERC for not imposing wholesale price caps on 
electricity, and has called Cheney "grossly misinformed" on the state's 
energy problems. Cheney, in turn, has called Davis' energy proposals 
"harebrained" and "goofy."

New views emerging on power
More elected officials support the concept of planned blackouts
By John Hill
Bee Capitol Bureau 
(Published May 23, 2001)

If Californians are to be left in the dark, they should at least know when to 
break out the candles or send the workers home. 
That's the growing sentiment among a range of elected officials, including 
Gov. Gray Davis, who are pushing the idea of planning power blackouts and 
giving businesses and residents ample warning. 
On Tuesday, the Democratic governor's office said Davis supports longer 
public notice than the 24 hours called for under a proposal by the California 
Independent System Operator, which runs the state's power grid. 
Assemblyman Mike Briggs, R-Fresno, introduced a bill that would lay out a 
blackout schedule for the summer. Businesses could make plans for the 
possible blackout days and also be assured that on all other days the lights 
would stay on. 
Briggs called his plan an improvement on the existing system in which "every 
day is a potential blackout day." 
A Senate committee, meanwhile, discussed planned blackouts as part of a 
strategy to gain leverage over electricity generators by declaring that the 
state will not pay above a certain amount for power. The state would ask 
Washington and Oregon to join the so-called "buyers' cartel." 
If the power generators refused to sell at the lower prices, the state would 
gut it out with planned blackouts. 
"Let's use the blackouts against the generators," Michael Shames, head of the 
San Diego-based Utility Consumers' Action Network, told the Energy, Utilities 
and Communications Committee. But Shames and others stressed the need for 
warnings of at least 12 hours and blackouts no longer than 90 minutes. 
"Absent that management of blackouts, we don't see how the buyers' cartel 
could work," Shames said. 
On a visit to Chicago on Monday, Davis said he talked to officials about the 
city's system for giving the public warning days before possible power 
blackouts, with definite notice right before. 
"There is no reason to keep that secret from the public when their safety is 
likely to be jeopardized," Davis told reporters Tuesday. The governor said he 
plans to meet in the next few days with managers at ISO to explore the idea 
of a system like Chicago's. 
The grid operator announced Monday that it will try to give the public at 
least a half-hour notice of outages, but many officials said Tuesday the 
public needs even more warning. Davis aides said the governor's plan will go 
beyond ISO's. 
There are potential pitfalls. Criminals might make their own plans, taking 
advantage of deactivated alarms. And some say that a schedule of blackouts 
might increase the number of outages. 
If people have been warned that a blackout is coming, and a last-minute 
supply of electricity makes it unnecessary, grid managers would have to 
decide whether to call it off, said Dorothy Rothrock, vice president of the 
California Manufacturers & Technology Association. 
If they did, it would add uncertainty to future warnings, she said, possibly 
leading them to order unnecessary blackouts. 
"Obviously, there are trade-offs," Rothrock said. 
Still, the idea of planning blackouts seems to be gaining ground as a way for 
the state to get back some control of the energy crisis, sorely lacking in 
recent months. 
"It would help us as Californians to say, 'The hell with you, George Bush, 
we're going to handle this ourselves,' " said Jim Overman, 68, of Elk Grove. 
Overman said he has been burning up the phone lines trying to persuade anyone 
who will listen that scheduled blackouts will make everyone's lives easier. 
Briggs said he has been told by constituents, including irrigators and food 
processors, that scheduled blackouts are the way to go. 
Irrigators would know that they shouldn't plan on getting water on a day that 
their electronic gates might be closed. 
Businesses could tell workers to stay home on a blackout day, or arrange for 
backup power generators, he said. 
"We would be very interested in it," said Ed Yates, senior vice president of 
the California League of Food Processors. 
Power blackouts are chaotic for processing plants, Yates said, requiring some 
plants to be re-sterilized and shutting down operations for more than a day. 
Some processors might choose to close on days when they faced a blackout, he 
said, losing revenue but avoiding the loss of thousands of pounds of food. 
"It doesn't solve the problem, but it helps manage a very difficult 
situation," he said. 
Briggs said that his plan would result in possible blackout days every two 
weeks. The plan would assume that a certain number of customers would have to 
turned off to keep the grid operating. If the electricity shortage went above 
that amount, people might still face unanticipated blackouts, Briggs said. 
One question is public safety. Some are queasy about burglars knowing when 
blackouts will occur. But pluses include the ability to arrange for temporary 
stop signs at road intersections, or families being able to arrange for a 
sick relative to be moved. 
"If the police have only five minutes notice, they can't get to difficult 
intersections to direct traffic, they can't help paramedics, fire departments 
and ambulances get where they have to be," Davis said. 
The manufacturers' association and other business groups haven't endorsed the 
idea yet, but say it's worth a look. 
"It's preferable to random, rolling blackouts," Rothrock said.

Californians' priorities for solving the crisis are outlined in a Field Poll
?Related graphic

Bee Deputy Capitol Bureau Chief 
(Published May 23, 2001)

Californians have some clear ideas on how to solve the energy crisis: build 
more nuclear power plants, cap the wholesale price of electricity and relax 
air-quality standards to allow older plants to be upgraded. 
And, according to a Field Poll released Tuesday, they're not so hot on the 
recently approved $13.4 billion bond authorization to pay for electricity, or 
the idea of Gov. Gray Davis seizing power plants through eminent domain. 
Poll architects said responses may be somewhat colored by respondents' 
unfamiliarity with all the issues or skepticism on the causes of the state's 
power woes. Nearly 60 percent said it essentially is an artificial crisis 
created by power companies to make money. 
But on one longstanding issue -- nuclear power -- the poll showed a clear 
preference and a dramatic shift in public opinion. 
In the highest recorded support for nuclear power in California since before 
the Three Mile Island disaster in 1979, 59 percent say they favor more 
nuclear plants in the state to provide electricity. 
Support among registered voters grows to 61 percent, with 33 percent opposed. 
Among Democrats, 53 percent support more nuclear plants, and three-fourths of 
Republicans and 55 percent of others agree. 
"The change in attitude is very significant because they know this issue," 
Field Poll Director Mark DiCamillo said. 
Californians' support for nuclear power reached nearly 70 percent in the 
mid-1970s in the aftermath of a nationwide energy crisis. But it plummeted to 
37 percent in 1979 after the partial meltdown at Pennsylvania's Three Mile 
Island plant and fell to 33 percent in 1984 -- the last time Field surveyed 
the question. 
In 1989, voters demanded that the Sacramento Municipal Utility District's 
Rancho Seco nuclear plant be shut down. The utility complied and has spent 
more than $200 million decommissioning it during the past 12 years. 
Although the poll results are in line with some private surveys done recently 
by nuclear-energy advocates, opponents say the Field Poll opinions could be 
misleading because the issue has been dormant for so long. Not since the late 
'70s has an application for a nuclear plant been filed in the United States. 
Only two operate in California -- San Onofre in San Diego County and Diablo 
Canyon in San Luis Obispo. 
"When the (poll) questions are on issues that people haven't thought about 
that much lately, you do get some aberrant results," said Bill Magavern, a 
lobbyist for the Sierra Club. "People right now are obviously concerned about 
electricity, but they haven't really thought about what it would be like to 
have a nuclear power plant in the neighborhood." 
The Field Poll results lend support to at least one aspect in the national 
energy plan recently released by President Bush, who called for more nuclear 
power plants nationwide. 
But poll respondents were even more insistent that the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission should impose caps on wholesale energy prices despite 
opposition from the Bush administration. The poll showed 70 percent of all 
adults and 68 percent of registered voters -- including 57 percent of Bush's 
fellow Republicans -- support the price controls. 
"It really does expose the Bush administration to long-term serious problems 
in California if they're perceived as not willing to help the state in this 
regard," DiCamillo said. "The public really thinks (price caps) should be 
imposed." 
Republicans in the survey support price caps despite Bush opposition, and 
Democrats narrowly oppose the move by Democratic lawmakers and Davis to 
authorize the largest bond sale in national history to pay for power 
purchases. 
Among all adults, 38 percent approve of the move, and 52 percent oppose it. 
Democrats disapprove of the bonds by a 46 percent to 44 percent margin. 
Californians' desire for clean air is softening in the face of the energy 
crunch, respondents said. 
By a margin of 51 percent to 41 percent, poll respondents say they would 
maintain air-quality standards rather than relax them to build plants. That 
support is down from a Field survey in January, when 59 percent said they'd 
rather maintain standards. Moreover, a majority (53 percent) say they would 
relax air-quality standards to get older plants back in operation, an 
increase from 47 percent in January. 
Slight majorities support a state-run public power authority (54 percent) and 
state-owned power transmission lines (51 percent), but DiCamillo said that 
some poll respondents were probably not familiar with all the implications of 
those moves. 
Responses to the idea of Davis seizing power plants if prices continue to 
rise this summer fell somewhat down partisan lines, with Democrats in favor, 
50 percent to 42 percent, and Republicans opposed, 52 percent to 32 percent. 
Overall, the idea was rejected by 48 percent of adults and favored by 44 
percent. 
A strong majority of registered voters, 56 percent, oppose additional 
offshore oil and gas drilling to ease the energy crunch, and 38 percent favor 
it.

Offshore drilling waits in the wings


(Published May 23, 2001)

WASHINGTON -- The release today of a piece of President Bush's energy policy 
has California lawmakers squirming. 
A natural gas advisory panel is set to unveil a 56-page report looking at 
whether moratoriums on offshore oil and gas development should be lifted. It 
will also name specific sites for possible drilling. 
Rep. Anna Eschoo, D-Palo Alto, said Tuesday that if the Bush administration 
tries to undo moratoriums protecting more than 170 million acres off the 
California coast, it would be like "targeting a missile at us." 
So far, the Bush administration hasn't taken any direct action. The energy 
policy he released last week calls for more oil and gas development, but its 
only recommendation about offshore drilling was that the secretaries of 
interior and commerce re-examine current laws and executive orders "to 
determine if changes are needed." 
Today's report is to urge selection of five of the most promising gas 
prospects in offshore areas covered by moratoriums in a pilot program aimed 
at eventual drilling. The report doesn't say where those five pilot areas 
should be. But Reps. Lois Capps, D-Santa Barbara, and Mike Thompson, D-Napa, 
are fearful that Morro Bay in San Louis Obispo County and the Eel River Basin 
in Humboldt County in their districts are likely choices.

Bush, Davis to meet, discuss state's energy crisis 

By Finlay Lewis
COPLEY NEWS SERVICE 
May 23, 2001 
WASHINGTON ) After weeks of holding California and its electricity crisis at 
arm's length, President Bush will plunge into the problem next week during a 
two-day visit to the state that will include a possible energy summit with 
California Gov. Gray Davis. 
White House press secretary Ari Fleischer told reporters Wednesday that the 
state's energy crisis will be "at the top of the list" when the president and 
the governor meet. The president's aides said that the time and place for the 
meeting are still being worked out. 
Bush's visit to the state will be his first since last fall's campaign. With 
their party enjoying only a slim majority in the U.S. House, some California 
Republicans have expressed dismay over their state's absence from the 
president's extensive post-inaugural travel schedule, fearing that the energy 
crisis could cost some GOP lawmakers their seats in next year's elections. 

Fleischer's announcement Wednesday of the meeting with Davis and its emphasis 
on energy caught many by surprise because the White House had given no hint 
until then that the president would address the issue during his upcoming 
trip to California. 
However, Davis called the White House on Tuesday night proposing a meeting 
with the president specifically to discuss energy. 
He followed up with two letters on Wednesday expressing the need for quicker 
action on the energy front: "Californians can't afford to wait four or five 
years for a permanent solution. We need relief today." 
In the longer of two letters, Davis wrote: "You and I don't agree on 
everything. But here's something we do have in common: we both inherited an 
energy mess. And the people that elected us expect us to clean it up." 
Davis also offered in the letters to "introduce" Bush to "business owners and 
everyday citizens who have been personally affected by this energy crisis." 
Fleischer said Wednesday that Bush would meet with "business leaders and 
energy consumers." 
Asked who initiated the meeting with Davis, Fleischer suggested the 
president's schedule had been drawn up independently of Davis' suggestions. 
"This is a case of they both want to meet with each other, and we're very 
pleased to be able to make it work out," he said. 
As for the meeting with the business leaders, Fleischer said, "The president 
has several events on his schedule that already include business leaders and 
energy consumers, and so it very well may happen that we're each suggesting 
similar things, which would be a healthy sign." 
Bush's itinerary also includes a stop on Tuesday at the Camp Pendleton Marine 
Corps Base designed to showcase his order directing the military to cut their 
energy use by 10 percent at California facilities. 
Fleischer said that the president wanted "to talk about how the federal 
government is going to be a strong partner to the state of California in the 
cause of energy conservation to help ease the burden in California as they go 
through the summer months when demand is high and blackouts are most at 
risk." 
The White House released an outline of the president's California itinerary 
on Tuesday afternoon. It indicated that the visit would not give prominent 
attention to the state's energy woes. 
Fleischer declined to say whether the president would expand on his energy 
plan in any way while in California. 
Davis and other California Democrats have been sharply critical of the Bush 
administration for failing to take decisive action to help alleviate the 
electricity shortage's toll on the state and its citizens. 
They are backing legislation due to come to a key vote on Thursday before the 
House Energy and Commerce Committee that would cap electricity rates in the 
state. The administration and most of the state's Republican lawmakers oppose 
the measure. 
Last week, Bush showcased an administration task force report on the nation's 
energy challenges that stressed long-range solutions focused mainly on 
increasing the supply of fossil fuels and an expanded role for nuclear power. 
The report also suggested incentives to encourage energy conservation and 
greater fuel efficiency. 
Bush's trip will begin on Monday when he flies from a Memorial Day event in 
Arizona to Los Angeles where he will spend the night. He will return to 
Washington on Wednesday night after a visit to the Fresno area. 
Bush assumed office despite losing the nation's most populous state by a 
decisive margin and then launched into the most ambitious travel schedule of 
any modern president. It included stops in 27 states ) not California.

California Democrats seek price caps on electricity

By Finlay Lewis
COPLEY NEWS SERVICE 
May 22, 2001 
WASHINGTON ) Accusing power generators of price gouging, a group of 
California House Democrats vowed Tuesday to try again this week to legislate 
price caps in order to bring down the energy bills in the state. 
Rep. Henry Waxman, a Los Angeles Democrat and author of the price-cap 
measure, said he would offer the measure as an amendment on Thursday. At that 
time the House Energy and Commerce Committee plans to complete work on a bill 
designed to reduce the number of blackouts expected in California this summer 
due to shortages in the supply of electrical power. 
Waxman and other Democrats seized on Republican fund-raising events on Monday 
and Tuesday nights involving President Bush and Vice President Cheney, 
charging the Republican administration with exacerbating the California 
situation by doing the bidding of the oil and gas industry in return for 
campaign contributions. 
"This is a contrived crisis in order to wreck our environmental protection 
laws," Waxman said. "It is a contrived crisis in order to produce 1000 
percent increases in profits for some of these generators." 
On the agenda when the committee meets Thursday will be a bill by Rep. Joe 
Barton, R-Texas, that would allow California Gov. Gray Davis to temporarily 
waive some air pollution limits to increase power production in the state 
when blackouts are imminent. 
It also would include: 
  federal help to ease a power transmission bottleneck in the Central Valley; 
  mandated power savings at federal facilities; 
  state discretion in adjusting daylight savings time; 
  an easing of the ties of some small, independent power generators to large 
utilities. 
Earlier this month, a subcommittee chaired by Barton rejected Waxman's 
price-cap amendment as some California Republicans complained that the idea 
of limiting power rates was politically inspired and would do nothing to 
solve California's crisis. 
The Bush administration and the energy industry oppose price caps, saying 
that such an approach would distort the market and worsen the electricity 
shortage in California and many other western states by discouraging 
exploration and production. 
Waxman's plan would require federal regulators in many cases to tie wholesale 
power rates to production costs, plus a "reasonable" profit. 
At the press conference, Rep. Bob Filner, D-San Diego, derided Republican 
opposition to price caps. 
Referring to wholesale power generators, Filner argued, "They were making 
money at $30 a megawatt; now they are charging up to $2,000. Believe me: They 
can make money off the market with a cost-base rate. They have done it for 
100 years. They can continue doing it." 
Rep. Jane Harman, D-Redondo Beach, said that California Republicans on the 
energy committee would suffer politically if they give into pressure from 
party leaders to oppose the price-cap bill. 
"There are no party affiliations for rate payers," said Harman, a committee 
member. "Republicans and Democrats have both seen the gouging of their rates 
in California." 





Mexico: No limit on number of new plants to be built 



Energy chief says 'anyone who requests a permit will get it'
By Diane Lindquist 
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER 
May 22, 2001 
Mexican Energy Secretary Ernesto Martens said yesterday that Mexico won't set 
any limit on the number of power plants in Baja California supplying 
electricity north of the border. 
"Since there's a window of opportunity here because of the need in California 
for electricity, anyone who requests a permit will get it," Martens said 
after speaking at the Institute of the Americas' 10th annual Latin American 
Energy Conference in La Jolla. 
Power plant construction in Baja California has become one of the most 
immediate solutions to California's electricity shortfalls. At least three 
plants being built in Baja California in the next four years will send 
electricity north of the border, where blackouts have interrupted normal 
activity. 
One facility, a Sempra Energy Corp. power plant near Mexicali, will export 
all of its electrical output to consumers north of the border. The San Diego 
company's project gained quick approval from Mexican authorities because the 
facility is not subject to restrictions imposed on private companies that 
supply electricity to the Mexican market. 
Other Mexican energy officials have said several other enterprises are 
interested in building similar facilities in Baja California. 
Such a mushrooming of projects is prompting concern on both sides of the 
border that the plants might have harmful effects on natural resources and 
public health and safety. 
In his speech, Martens emphasized Mexico's commitment to preserving the 
environment and local communities. 
But afterward, he said Mexico will approve any number of Baja California 
projects to serve California consumers. 
"I don't see any limit. The only limit is the ability of the interconnecting 
lines to transmit the electricity that is produced," he said. 
With a capacity of only 400 megawatts each, the two transmission 
interconnections linking the electricity grids of California and Baja 
California will not be able to transmit all of the 1,500 megawatts of 
electricity for the California market produced by the new Baja California 
plants -- let alone any additional facilities. 
Sempra, whose San Diego Gas & Electric subsidiary owns both the 
interconnecting lines, plans to upgrade the interconnector near Mexicali, 
spokesman Michael Clark said yesterday. The improvement will transmit 
electricity from Sempra's plant in Baja California to the company substation 
in Imperial Valley. The other connection links San Diego and Tijuana. 
Clark said he doesn't know how the other companies building Baja California 
plants plan to transmit their electricity. Representatives of the firms could 
not be reached yesterday. 
Even if the companies find a way to send electricity across the border, the 
California grid system presents another obstacle. 
To prepare for the possibility of more demands on the Southern California 
grid, the Imperial Irrigation District is analyzing what capacity it has for 
transmitting supplies on its lines and how to assess tariffs for the service. 
"It's become very important because of our proximity to Mexico," said 
district spokesman Ron Hull. 
The ability to transmit electricity is only one force limiting plant 
construction in Baja California. Another is the supply of fuel to drive the 
facilities. 
Sempra again is a key player in this area. It plans to build a North Baja 
Pipeline that will supply natural gas to its own and two other power plants 
in Baja California and the proposed Otay Mesa plant in San Diego. The 
pipeline won't provide fuel for any other facilities. 
"It's fully subscribed," said Clark. "In the future if there is enough 
demand, the compression could be increased." 
Energy Secretary Martens, however, hinted at the possibility of new natural 
gas supplies in Baja California. He said Mexico wants liquified natural gas 
facilities to be built in Rosarito Beach and Ensenada. 
While several companies have expressed an interest in such an operation, 
Martens' comments were the first to indicate that two, and not one, might be 
approved for Baja California. 




Potential governor candidate launches Northern California tour

(05-24) 00:01 PDT LIVERMORE, Calif. (AP) -- 
Republican William E. Simon Jr. says he won't decide until the first week of 
June whether to jump into the race for governor, although he appeared to be 
campaigning for the job this week. 
Trailed by a group of reporters Wednesday, the wealthy Pacific Palisades 
investment banker visited Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and took a 
few jabs at both Democratic Gov. Gray Davis and his potential GOP primary 
opponent, Secretary of State Bill Jones. 
"I think there's a leadership crisis in Sacramento," said Simon, who 
criticized Davis' handling of the state's power crisis. 
"You have the same elected people today trying to figure out a solution to 
the crisis that got us into the crisis," Simon said. 
Pressed to explain how he would end the crisis that has brought rolling 
blackouts and soaring power bills, Simon said he still is preparing his own 
plan. 
The son of Ford administration Treasury Secretary William E. Simon insisted 
he has yet to make a final decision on whether to run in 2002, adding he 
would make up his mind by June 4 after consulting with his family. 
Asked if he has any ties to companies profiting from the power crisis, Simon 
said he owns a "small piece" of a Texas-based company that makes equipment 
used in extracting or processing oil and natural gas. 
Before founding his investment banking firm with his father in 1988 he was an 
assistant U.S. attorney in New York. 
Simon started forming a campaign team in March, including John Herrington, 
former U.S. energy secretary under President Reagan and former chairman of 
the state Republican Party. 
Of potential primary opponent Jones, Simon said: "He seems like a perfectly 
nice fellow. ... I just don't think that he provides the contrast to Gray 
Davis that I do."

POLL: Californians dissatisfied with government handling of energy crisis

(05-24) 06:22 PDT SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- 
Over the past four months, Californians have developed increasingly negative 
feelings toward state and federal officials and agencies involved in 
California's energy crisis, according to a Field Poll released Thursday. 
A large number of those surveyed are also fearful that Pacific Gas & 
Electric's bankruptcy filing will make it more difficult for the company to 
provide service to its customers. 
Fifty-seven percent of those questioned in May by the Field Institute, a San 
Francisco-based nonpartisan polling organization, gave California's private 
electric utilities a poor rating. That's more than the 40 percent of 
respondents who rated the utilities performance as poor in January. 
The same negative feelings held true for out-of-state energy providers. 
Fifty-five percent of respondents this month rated their performance as poor, 
a noticeable increase from the 44 percent of respondents who gave them a poor 
rating in January. 
Specifically, those surveyed were asked to rate the job being done by 
officials and groups working to improve the energy situation in the state. 
The poll found that: 
* The percentage of those surveyed who gave the state Public Utilities 
Commission a poor rating rose from 42 percent in January to 52 percent in 
May. 
* 41 percent of those surveyed gave the state legislature a poor rating in 
May, as opposed 36 percent in January. 
* 38 percent gave Gov. Gray Davis a poor rating in May for his handling of 
the state's energy woes, a sharp increase from 22 percent who gave him a poor 
rating in January. 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission also drew negative ratings from 
respondents. In May, 52 percent said FERC was doing a poor job, as opposed to 
40 percent who gave the commission a rating of poor in January. 
Those surveyed were also asked if PG&E's bankruptcy would make it more 
difficult for the company to supply electricity to customers, and 49 percent 
said they thought it would. 
The poll, which questioned 1,015 California adults between May 11 and May 20, 
has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points, the institute 
said.

Energy crisis to cast long shadow 
A look at what energy crisis means to future

NS121240.DTL&type=news 
What we need to do is tune in, turn off and drop out. 
Tune in to how you use energy. Turn off those things that use electricity. 
And drop out of the power grid by using alternative power sources and 
alternatives to power sources. 
That's the only thing we can do in the short term. 
In the long term, you can almost see what will be coming down the pike. 
As the state's energy problems worsen, as the state throws its surplus down a 
rathole, as our own utility bills skyrocket and as blackouts roll across the 
state, someone will write a statewide ballot initiative and get it on the 
ballot. 
It will do two things. 
First, it will undo the deregulation of the state's energy industry. It will 
try to put everything back the way it was. 
Second, it will punish the producers of power and energy. 
It will levy some new fee or tax or it will regulate the industry as a public 
utility or it will require that the state take over the industry entirely. 
Huge amounts of money will be spent against it. Opponents will outspend 
supporters by a substantial amount. 
TV ads will run constantly, predicting dire consequences if the initiative is 
approved. 
We'll be told it will be bad for business. Labor leaders will tell us that it 
will cost jobs. Experts will say it will have no effect on the problem, or 
make the problem worse. 
All of that will probably be true. 
The initiative will pass easily. 
It will pass because it will appear to address what are widely understood as 
the two main causes of the current energy crisis -- a badly bungled 
deregulation and unbelievably greedy energy producers. 
It will pass because the initiative's authors will understand that most of us 
are furious about the way this mess was created and that we're eager to take 
it out on the industry leaders we see as the leading villains. 
It will pass precisely because all the people who will tell us it shouldn't 
are the people who got us into this disaster in the first place, and we won't 
believe them. 
It's much harder to say whether the energy crisis will have more immediate 
political repercussions for some of the elected officials we might blame for 
the problem -- such as the state Legislature and Gov. Davis, who could have 
done something about this a year ago and chose not to. 
Yes, the latest polls make it clear that Californians are furious with Davis 
and the Legislature. 
But elections for office are not yes/no propositions -- you don't get to vote 
up or down on Davis. 
They are a contest between two major party candidates, which means elections 
are always a matter of comparisons -- Davis compared with his opponent. 
Someone has to come along and convince voters he or she can do the job better 
than Davis. 
There might, indeed, be such people. It's unlikely one of those people will 
appear on the ballot in 2002, however. 
The current political landscape is heavily populated with profiles in 
discouragement -- people who, fearful of losing, lack the nerve to run 
against a well-financed incumbent. 
The great irony here is that voters thought term limits would solve that 
problem -- rather than being stuck with a well-financed incumbent, we'd force 
him out of office. 
In reality, we're stuck with the well-financed incumbent until his term 
limits are up -- in six or eight years. 
That does nothing to solve the problems that might arise in those six to 
eight years. It has done nothing to embolden would-be candidates. Now, they 
just meekly wait their turn. 
And it has made a shambles of the legislative process by populating the 
Capitol with people who don't know what they're doing, only where they're 
going next. Meanwhile, the people who do know what they're doing have been 
kicked out office. 
It's no coincidence that the deregulation mess was made in a Legislature full 
of people elected during the term-limit era. 
A statewide initiative, brave candidates, ending term limits -- those are all 
things that will happen in the future. 
Right now, it's time to tune in, turn off and drop out. 
Tune in to what you are doing as an individual consumer -- cast a critical 
eye at your own habits. 
Turn off your appliances, your lights, your air conditioner and reduce your 
individual energy consumption. It's much easier than it appears. 
Energy consumption has dropped in my household by more than a third by 
switching off some lights, converting to fluorescent light bulbs, turning 
down the refrigerator and connecting some appliances to a power strip, so 
that they truly are turned off. 
Finally, drop out of the power grid. Look for other ways to power your home 
-- most notably solar power, which is readily available. 
Find other alternatives to high-consumption appliances, such as clotheslines. 
Drop out. 
They can't gouge you if they can't get to you.

I live in Sacramento, where we do use air-conditioning in the summer. I 
covered two skylights with aluminum foil to keep the heat out. Two east- 
facing windows have exterior roll-up blinds. . . . I adjusted my pool pump 
from six hours per day to two hours from 6 to 8 a.m. This saves electricity 
and puts the usage in the morning, which is not the peak usage. I keep my 
computer power strip and music/VCR power strip switched off. This alone saves 
about one kilowatt hour per day. I replaced four of my most used lights with 
fluorescent bulbs. You really don't need to change all of your bulbs, just 
the ones that are on for several hours per day. So far, I've cut about 
one-third of my usage, with very little lifestyle change.

Household air conditioners are energy guzzlers. Consider, instead, the merits 
of an evaporative cooler (a.k.a. swamp cooler), ideal in low-humidity locales 
such as California. They consume only about 25 percent of what it would take 
to operate an air conditioner. 
Martha Kimmich 
Walnut Creek 
The suggestion that a frost-free refrigerator's compressor will run less if 
ice cubes are put in Tupperware because it won't waste energy trying to 
"defrost" trays of ice cubes is pure nonsense. The duration of the defrost 
cycle is controlled by a timer, which turns on a heater for a fixed duration 
of time daily. Putting ice in Tupperware will, in fact, prevent the cubes 
from "evaporating" (technically - sublimating) as they do when left in their 
trays for long periods, and as such is a good idea - but not because the 
compressor will run less. 
Jack Petit 
The five major league baseball teams in California need to move to a day- 
only schedule for the rest of the year. That will also mean no Monday night 
games for the NFL teams this fall or winter. . . . No more private and public 
tennis clubs leaving their lights on their courts late into the night. . . . 
Attempt to combine or limit the venues in which public meetings are held. 
Often these halls are overly well-lighted, with only a few citizens 
attending. Reduce hours amusement parks are opened, and reduce the amount of 
lighting in underused areas. Limit the hours movie theaters are open. The 
matinees are sparsely attended, but use a lot of power to light and cool the 
theater. 
Hugh Cavanaugh 
When is San Francisco going to catch up with the rest of America and begin to 
install high-density sodium vapor lamps (the "yellow light") in place of all 
of its outside public lighting? They use one-third the energy of "white 
light" and put out three times the light. Also, if the state would give 
building owners a tax incentive to install "motion sensor"-controlled 
lighting systems, all these empty office buildings' lights could safely be 
shut off at night when these large buildings are empty. 
Rollin W. Roberts 
Require that all businesses keep their doors shut when open for business. One 
day recently on upper Market Street when it was 55 degrees and windy, I took 
a tally and 60 percent of the businesses had their doors open. 
Bill Choisser 
San Francisco 
After your dishwasher has completed the wash cycle, open the door, pull out 
the racks and there will be a big whoosh of steam. The hot temperature of the 
dishes and glasses themselves (from the wash cycle) creates instant 
evaporation. In a minute your dishes are dry and cool. The only reason for a 
drying cycle is because they're enclosed. 
Dan Lucas 
(One reader) wrote she turns off all her large appliances, including TV/VCR, 
at the breaker box, when not in use. These appliances do not use power when 
the switches are off, except maybe a clock. Most circuit breakers are not 
rated for switching purposes. They are for over-current protection only. Over 
time you will damage them with continual on/off switching.

Davis to order 1-hour notice of blackouts 
Plan also in works to give law enforcement even earlier alerts

N2963.DTL&type=news 
Sacramento -- Gov. Gray Davis will issue an executive order today requiring 
that Californians be given at least one hour's notice before blackouts hit, 
according to a top administration official. 
The one-hour notice is double what the California Independent System 
Operator, managers of the state's electrical grid, proposed earlier this 
week. The ISO board is scheduled to discuss its plan at a meeting today. 
Details of Davis' plan were still being worked out, said the administration 
official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. But any plan would have to 
order the ISO to give more notice of potential blackouts. 
Davis also hopes to give 48-hour and then 24-hour notices of probable 
blackout scenarios. Administration officials said the two-day notice would go 
to law enforcement, while everyone would get a 24-hour warning. 
Business groups welcomed the executive order. 
"We need to plan, we need to make adjustments in business schedules," said 
Jeanne Cain, vice president for government relations for the California 
Chamber of Commerce. "There are concerns about employee safety issues. The 
more notice we have, the better we can accommodate the blackout." 
Carl Guardino, an ISO board member and president of the Silicon Valley 
Manufacturing Group, has been pushing for an advanced notification plan and 
working with the governor. 
"Sixty minutes is twice as good" as 30 minutes, he said. 
With little doubt that blackouts will hit this summer, lawmakers have been 
searching for a way to make them easier on residents and businesses. 
"As much notice as possible would be helpful. It's helpful to have some 
advance notice for planning purposes, but small businesses will still be hurt 
by the blackouts," said Shirley Knight, assistant state director of the 
National Federation of Independent Business. 
"Most small businesses are in the service sector so they're open during the 
day, which means small-business owners aren't going to be able to recoup 
those blackout costs like a manufacturer might be able to," Knight said. 
But one consumer group said Davis should be doing more to stop the blackouts 
from happening in the first place. 
"It's like saying you're going to know a half hour earlier that an earthquake 
is coming," said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer 
Rights. "We should be stopping blackouts by standing up to the energy 
generators, rather than giving us an extra 30 minutes." 
'POWER WATCH' 
The Independent System Operator's proposed plan for forecasting potential 
blackouts envisions a system that would provide a 24-hour notice of high- 
demand days. A "Power Watch" would be declared whenever a Stage 1 or Stage 2 
alert is likely, while a "Power Warning" would be issued whenever there is at 
least a 50 percent chance of a Stage 3 alert, when electricity reserves drop 
below 1.5 percent. 
Until now, the agency has refused to give more than a few minutes' warning of 
blackouts, saying it did not want to alarm people when there was still a 
chance that a last-minute purchase of power could stave off blackouts. 
Pacific Gas and Electric Co. said it would welcome the advance notice to be 
able to notify customers who rely on electricity for life-critical equipment 
and large businesses. 
"We welcome advance notice from the ISO that would allow us to communicate to 
customers about pending rotating outages," said Ron Low, a spokesman for 
PG&E.
The public safety aspect must be taken into account, said one consumer group. 
"Blackouts have serious consequences, not just economic," said Mindy Spatt, 
spokeswoman for The Utility Reform Network in San Francisco. "They create 
public safety hazards, and all of those issues cannot be addressed from 
warnings. But knowing in advance is better." 
E-MAIL ALERTS
The ISO also has been working to upgrade its Web site to provide the most 
current information about how much electricity is being used and how much is 
available. It will also establish a system this summer through which that 
information can be sent in an hourly e-mail. 
This information may make it easier for larger users of electricity to plan 
their operations. 
Enlightening advice to prepare for blackouts Here's some advice from PG&E and 
local utilities about how to prepare for blackouts: 
-- Have a flashlight and radio with fresh batteries available. If you light 
candles, observe the usual safety precautions. 
-- If the lights go out, check with neighbors to determine if your home alone 
is affected. It may be a downed power line or some other problem, in which 
case you should alert PG&E or your city electrical bureau. 
-- Unplug or turn off all appliances, TVs and computers. Leave one light on 
to warn you when the power comes back on. 
-- When the power returns, turn one appliance on at a time to prevent power 
surges. 
-- Don't plug a generator into the wall; when the lights return, it can send 
a high-voltage current through the system that can electrocute power workers. 
-- Don't open your refrigerator, so your food will remain cold. 
-- Tell children who are home alone to remain calm, turn off the TV and 
computers and not to use candles.

Californians angry across the board in energy crisis 
Poll rates Bush worse than Davis 
John Wildermuth, Chronicle Political Writer

Californians are increasingly unhappy with the way Gov. Gray Davis has 
handled the state's power crunch, but he has plenty of company in their 
energy doghouse, a Field Poll shows. 
The state's power companies, out-of-state energy providers, President Bush 
and the Legislature all come out worse than Davis in the survey. 
"Davis' ratings have gone down, but a lot of others are given lower ratings" 
when people are asked to rank how the politicians and institutions are 
handling the state's energy situation, said Mark DiCamillo, director of the 
Field Poll. 
Growing worries about the seriousness of the power problem have sent ratings 
skidding for anyone connected with the energy business. 
"Everyone has gotten tarred," DiCamillo said. 
A solid 57 percent of those surveyed believe that Pacific Gas and Electric 
Co. and the state's other private electric utilities have done a poor or very 
poor job with the energy problem, with out-of-state power providers ranked 
almost as low. But 54 percent also put Bush's efforts in the poor/very poor 
category, and 52 percent consigned the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
to the same level. 
The growing disdain for the federal energy program probably can be linked 
with the president's refusal to back limits on energy prices, which are 
supported by a wide range of California residents, DiCamillo said. 
"To the extent that federal officials are seen as not bending on that issue, 
" he said, "I suspect that their ratings will continue to be rather dismal." 
The survey showed that Davis has had some success in his attempt to deflect 
the blame for California's energy woes from his office, but there are 
indications that that strategy may not work forever. 
Although 41 percent thought the governor was doing a good or very good job 
with the power crisis in January, that number fell to 27 percent in the new 
survey. The percentage of residents giving him poor or very poor marks jumped 
to 38 percent, up from 22 percent in January. 
The survey was conducted May 11 to May 20 of 1,015 California residents. It 
has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points. 
In the survey, Californians were quick to congratulate themselves on their 
own response to the energy problem. The poll showed that 39 percent believe 
residential energy consumers are doing a good or very good job responding to 
the problem, up from 26 percent in January. 
"People think they're making an effort to conserve," DiCamillo said. "In the 
public's eye, it's everyone else that is not doing what they should be 
doing." 
The survey also shows that the public has few illusions about the seriousness 
of the energy crunch. More than 80 percent believe it will be a year or more 
before the energy crisis is resolved, and more than half are convinced it 
will take at least two years to ensure a steady supply of electricity. 
"The gravity of the situation is such that the public is bracing itself for a 
long haul," DiCamillo said. "The state hasn't been able to fix the problem in 
a hurry, and people don't believe it's going to happen." 
The survey also showed that nearly half the state's residents believe that 
PG&E's bankruptcy will make it harder to continue to supply electricity to 
its customers while 59 percent say it would be a serious problem if 
businesses began to leave the state because of the possibility of blackouts. 
Concern about the continuing energy problem was strong across the state, 
DiCamillo said. 
"This is recognized as a major statewide issue," he said. "People think it 
will have an effect on them, regardless of where they live."

To encourage Oaklanders to take advantage of renewable energy, the city will 
waive fees and expedite plans for residents and business owners who want to 
install solar panels or other alternative energy generators. 
Previously, getting the necessary permits could take as long as eight weeks 
and cost more than $1,000. 
But under a measure proposed by Mayor Jerry Brown and approved Tuesday night 
by the Oakland City Council, the design review process will be waived if the 
equipment installation meets certain requirements, such as matching the pitch 
of a sloped roof. Permits will be free.

THE ENERGY CRUNCH 
New tips on power squeezing

U190766.DTL&type=news 
If you want to wrap yourself in the flag these days, there's no better way 
than by promoting energy conservation. 
Scientists from the Lawrence Livermore and Lawrence Berkeley national 
laboratories held a news conference yesterday to highlight new technologies 
and information sources to help consumers and businesses cut down on 
electricity use this summer. 
Flanked by tiny models of buildings with white roofs (up to 45 degrees cooler 
than dark ones), big charts showing U.S. energy flow and an array of "energy 
vampire" devices such as battery chargers that suck power whenever they're 
plugged in, earnest researchers discussed ways Californians can reduce their 
electricity use by 20 percent this summer. 
Meeting the goal has a big payoff, besides the obvious one of averting 
blackouts: Under the governor's 20/20 Rebate Plan, those who conserve 20 
percent this summer compared with the same months last year will not only 
shave that amount off their bills, but also get an equivalent rebate from the 
state -- essentially saving 40 percent. 
The technologies were a combination of new twists on humble objects and 
futuristic geeks-only inventions: 
-- WEB SITES. For folks who want to get a taste of the high-wire act lived 
every day by California grid operators, energycrisis.lbl.gov gives real-time 
data on the current supply and demand for electricity in the state. When you 
see the purple line (forecast load) start to hover near the red line 
(potential capacity), you know it's time to turn off the lights and hit the 
Save button. 
Lawrence Berkeley Lab is sponsoring three Web pages -- savepower.lbl.gov, 
HomeEnergySaver.lbl.gov and HomeImprovementTool.lbl.gov -- that offer 
customized conservation tips based on the user's climate and type of house -- 
saving 8 percent by using clotheslines instead of a dryer, for example. 
-- LAMPS. Lawrence Berkeley scientists have created the eponymous "Berkeley 
lamp," expected to go on sale in July for under $150. It's a high-performance 
table lamp with two fluorescent bulbs that together use less than 110 watts, 
but provide light equivalent to 300 or 400 watts. The lamp provides both 
"uplight," for illuminating an entire room, and "downlight," for close tasks 
such as reading. To be manufactured by Light Corp. of Minnesota, it will be 
sold through the company's Web site at www.lightcorp.com. 
Another, existing lamp -- a floor-standing torchere that uses compact 
fluorescent bulbs instead of halogen bulbs -- is widely available in hardware 
and lighting stores from a variety of manufacturers. 
-- WINDOWS. "Low-emissivity" windows look as transparent as regular glass but 
reflect infrared light, reducing heat transmission. The technology is now 
available in about 40 percent of windows sold. Consumers can recognize 
energy- efficient windows by a government "Energy Star" label; more 
information is available at www.efficientwindows.org. 
-- SCI-FI CHANNEL. At Lawrence Livermore Lab, scientists have been working on 
technology that's not for average users, but could eventually bring us up to 
date with the Jetsons. 
Technologies include electromechanical (flywheel) batteries, which can bridge 
the gap when the power goes off, thereby protecting sensitive electronic 
equipment. 
Then there are solid oxide fuel cells, which produce energy from fuel without 
using combustion -- a technology of the future, both for vehicles and 
stationary power. 
The Livermore researchers are also studying ways to make geothermal energy 
(which accounts for 6 percent of California's supply) more efficient and 
methods to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions from diesel generators. 
Further out, scientists hope to be able to store electricity, so energy from 
wind farms, for example, could be used at the times it's needed the most, 
instead of only when the weather cooperates.

House panel calls off vote on Calif power bill
WASHINGTON, (Reuters) - The U.S. Energy and Commerce Committee has called 
off, at least temporarily, a vote on legislation to aid California and other 
states during this summer's expected electricity shortage. 
Rep. Billy Tauzin, the Louisiana Republican chairman of the committee, said 
lawmakers needed more time to seek a bipartisan deal to get agreement on 
immediate help for power-starved California and the West. 
``We may be on the verge of a very solid bipartisan agreement,'' Tauzin said. 
He hoped that talks on Thursday would allow a vote on the pending legislation 
as early as today. 
The legislation was written by Republicans to reduce demand and encourage 
more supply of power in California this summer. Many Democrats on the 
committee objected to the bill, saying it needed a provision to cap wholesale 
prices in the entire Western region or else it fails to help the situation. 
Republican lawmakers, along with the Bush administration, strongly oppose 
price controls.






Davis proposal for more diesel power draws environmental criticism
LOS ANGELES (AP) -- California would get a little power and a lot of 
pollution from a proposal being considered by Gov. Gray Davis that would pay 
owners of backup generators to produce electricity. 
The proposal, one of several options the governor is considering, would pay 
for diesel power -- which at its dirtiest is 500 times more polluting than 
the cleanest natural gas power plants -- when electricity supplies are 
stretched. 
``If backup generators were to be used, it would only be as a last resort to 
avoid blackouts,'' said Davis spokesman Roger Salazar. ``Unfortunately, we 
are in an emergency situation. Everything is on the table.'' 
California's persistent power shortage has led to rolling blackouts around 
the state several times this year, with more anticipated when hot summer 
weather prompts people to use air conditioning. 
If all of the state's backup generators ran full time, they would produce 
about 425 tons of nitrogen dioxide per day. That's more than nine times the 
pollution power plants produced on an average day in 1999, according to state 
Air Resources Board data. 
And the state would get only about 550 megawatts of electricity -- barely 1 
percent of the state's peak power needs -- from the backup generators. That 
would be enough to power about 550,000 homes. 
``They could have a huge negative effect on air quality,'' said Ellen Garvey, 
executive officer for the Bay Area Air Quality Management Agency. ``It's one 
thing to run these generators during blackouts and emergency conditions, but 
using them for other purposes could be devastating.'' 
Business groups that support the proposal include the League of Food 
Processors, the California Manufacturers and Technology Association and San 
Diego Gas & Electric. 
``These generators could go a long way to taking some demand off the electric 
grid and putting some supply back into the power system,'' said Gino DiCaro, 
spokesman for the manufacturers and technology association. 
Most of the state's 17,200 backup generators are small units that run on 
diesel fuel and lack pollution controls. Some are rentals, and others can be 
found at hospitals, office buildings, sewage treatment plants and university 
labs. 
Unlike backup generators intended for home use, which are not regulated, 
industrial-sized units are limited in the number of hours they can operate. 
But since the state's power crunch began, regional air-quality regulators 
have issued emergency rules allowing them to run more frequently. 
Diesel engines produce carcinogenic soot and oxides of nitrogen -- a building 
block of asthma-inducing smog.











Small generators fight for payment from utilities 
Posted at 11:24 p.m. PDT Wednesday, May 23, 2001 
BY JENNIFER BJORHUS 

Mercury News 


BAKERSFIELD -- A gray cat picks its way through the lot of Oildale Energy, a 
small natural gas-fired power plant on the city's gritty northeast edge. The 
clamor of machinery and trucks -- sounds that meant prosperity here -- is 
gone. Employees have painted Oildale's machinery, insulated the boilers and 
tweaked the motionless 13-ton turbine. 
Now they wait. 
``It's kind of like a skeleton,'' says plant manager Mike Pankratz, surveying 
the octopus-tangle of pipes and tanks. 
Choked by the $10 million Pacific Gas & Electric Co. owes it, Oildale shut 
down Feb.?6, taking its 40 megawatts of badly needed electricity with it. The 
hush here is the sound of small generators locked in one of the most serious 
issues of California's energy crisis -- one that state regulators plan to 
wrestle with today. 
Oildale is part of a growing legion of small generators, from geothermal to 
gas-fired co-generation plants, battling California's utilities and state 
price controls they say are crippling them. These small generators, owed 
about $1.5 billion, supply up to a third of California's electricity. 
At least 25 have sued Southern California Edison over unpaid bills. Four have 
sued PG&E. And PG&E's bankruptcy proceedings in San Francisco are clogged 
with motions from at least 19 small generators, including Oildale. In many 
cases, these companies want to end their long-term supply contracts with the 
utilities so they can sell their electricity on the more lucrative open 
market. 
``What this is, basically, is the revolt of the mice,'' said Bill Short with 
Ridgewood Power Management, a New Jersey firm that has shuttered three 
gas-fired generators in California and sued PG&E. 
Officials to weigh debt 
The companies are hoping for action from the California Public Utilities 
Commission, which is scheduled today to weigh whether to order the utilities 
to pay the back debt. Meanwhile, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali wades 
through motions filed by disgruntled generators and counter motions from 
PG&E. 
The deteriorating finances of some of the approximately 690 small generators 
threatens California's fragile power supply just as the state heads into the 
summer months up to 3,700 megawatts short. 
The deep and often unexpected economic impacts of California's energy crunch 
add up daily. In Oildale's case, the shutdown not only jeopardizes the jobs 
of its 10 anxious employees, but those of more than 150 employees at the 
refinery next door. 
It's one of the biggest public policy botches in the energy crisis, some 
energy experts argue. California is shooting itself in the foot by not 
attending to the relatively clean and efficient small power suppliers in its 
own back yard, they say. Gas-fired co-generation plants, which provide power 
to nearby businesses and sell electricity to utilities, are some of the most 
efficient producers in the state. And many of the small generators harness 
renewable resources like the sun and garbage fumes, lessening the state's 
dependence on high-priced natural gas. 
``The idea that we're refusing to step in and help them while we're paying 
through the nose to pay Dynegy and Williams and everybody else, this is just 
nuts,'' said Severin Borenstein, director of the University of California 
Energy Institute, mentioning companies that own major power plants in the 
state. ``This is really a major blunder.'' 
The immediate crisis started in late January, Oildale's Pankratz explained. 
That's when PG&E told the plant it was not going to pay for electricity 
delivered in December. The news worried Oildale's gas supplier, Pankratz 
said, which halted the plant's supply. 
Pankratz turned off the plant's turbine. 
The move socked Golden Bear Oil Specialties, the refinery that looms over 
Oildale. Unable to operate without the cheap steam heat Oildale supplies, 
Golden Bear cannot heat the asphalt and industrial oils it produces. Golden 
Bear filed for bankruptcy April 23. Last week it announced plans to lay off 
172 employees. 
Golden Bear Chairman Carl Soderlind said Oildale, Golden Bear's exclusive 
source of steam heat for nearly 20 years, was a key reason his group bought 
the refinery four years ago. Having it go under was ``gut-wrenching,'' he 
said. 
Power unavailable 
The California Independent System Operator, keeper of the state's electricity 
grid, reports that 1,400 megawatts of power from small generators are off 
line. It estimates that about half of that -- 700 megawatts, or energy for as 
many as 700,000 homes -- is due to the financial squeeze of natural gas 
prices, money owed by the utilities or both. Others say financial problems 
have 1,100 megawatts off line. 
Lawmakers haven't been much help. The state Assembly on March?22 rejected a 
hastily crafted rescue bill meant to help buttress these companies. The issue 
has languished in Sacramento. 
Days later, the utilities commission ordered California's utilities to pay 
the generators for electricity delivered in the future -- which saved many of 
them -- but it did not order the utilities to pay the hefty back-due amounts. 
It also set a new rate for what utilities should pay the generators for 
electricity. That price is 22 percent lower and too low for business, some 
argue. 
The commission's position has been that the small generators should abide by 
their existing contracts, said commission attorney Gary Cohen: ``To the 
extent that some of them are facing financial hardship, the commission may 
take a look at whether it can do anything to help them vis-a-vis the back 
debt.'' 
The lack of stronger action to support these generators baffles some critics. 
``It's like talking to a starving man on a desert island and saying, `How 
long can you hold up until the ship comes?'?'' said V. John White, director 
of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies. 
Some of the companies have appealed to the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission, but regulators are waiting to see if the state and the courts can 
resolve the issue. 
``We're in what essentially amounts to an abusive relationship,'' said Short 
with Ridgewood, the independent generator that has sued PG&E. 
Two courts have allowed generators fighting Edison to suspend their 
contracts. Five have lost their fights. Another five have won the right to 
put a lien on Edison's assets. 
In PG&E's battle, three of the four lawsuits are on hold because of the 
bankruptcy. In the fourth, a judge allowed a generator out of the contract it 
had terminated before the bankruptcy. 
As for Oildale, it wants PG&E to pay the $10.5 million it owes or Oildale 
wants to sell its electricity on the open market. It also wants PG&E to pay 
what it calls ``a fair market value'' for its electricity. 
If Oildale can't sell on the open market soon, it will be forced into 
bankruptcy, its attorneys argue. Pankratz estimates his plant can hang in 
limbo only three more months. 
PG&E is fighting to keep its small generators, which it says are exaggerating 
their damage. It reports that only a tiny fraction of its 300 generators are 
off line. 
Increased costs 
If the plants were released from their contracts, PG&E could not afford to 
pay the extra $284 million per month it estimates electricity would cost. The 
state Department of Water Resources -- and ultimately ratepayers -- would 
have to foot that bill. 
A fast solution isn't likely from the bankruptcy court. The judge has made it 
clear the generators raise a host of complicated legal questions. 
Meanwhile, the clock ticks. 
``We've all been a little tense,'' says Judy Andreatta, who has worked 
Oildale's front desk for 10 years and worries about her job. ``It's just so 
scary watching everything happen. Who'd ever think we'd lose power?''













Electricity notebook 
FERC may renew price caps 
May 24, 2001 
From Register wire services 
Federal regulators this week announced that they might reimpose caps on the 
cost of transporting natural gas into southern California. 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Tuesday gave the public 20 days 
to comment on the possibility of reinstating caps, which were temporarily 
suspended by the commission this year. The price controls were lifted in an 
effort to expand the reach of deregulation. 
This proposed action, said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., "could make a 
real difference." 
"Since FERC engaged in this experimental lifting of the cap, the price of 
natural gas in Southern California has climbed to three times higher than the 
rest of the nation,'' said Feinstein. Currently, she said, the price in 
Southern California is $12.59 per million British Thermal Units and only 
$3.70 in the rest of the Western region. Gas fuels most 
electricity-generating plants in the state. 
The commission also asked for comment on whether the caps should be limited 
to California or include other Western markets. 













Legislators search for a Plan B for Edison 
Davis' tack is politically volatile. The aim still is to steer clear of 
bankruptcy. 
May 24, 2001 
By HANH KIM QUACH 
and KATE BERRY
The Orange County Register 
SACRAMENTO Lawmakers this week will seek to swap the deal Gov. Gray Davis 
made to rescue the state's No. 2 utility from financial ruin with something 
more politically palatable. 
Davis' deal, some have complained, is sweeter for Southern California Edison 
than for taxpayers. So at least four proposals are being floated to supplant 
that plan. But legislators are far from a consensus on any of them. Plans 
emerge, recede and are reconfigured daily. 
Energy experts and bankruptcy lawyers warn that too much legislative fiddling 
could result in what neither side wants: bankruptcy for Edison. 
Bankruptcy means the state would be stuck buying energy until both Edison and 
Pacific Gas & Electric - which is already in bankruptcy - complete the 
Chapter 11 process, which could take years, experts and lawmakers said. 
The state's wallet would shrink, affecting its ability to build schools and 
roads. Ratepayers might be on the hook for an additional $1 billion for the 
company's legal fees, because bankruptcy would freeze its assets, said Brian 
Bennett, vice president of Edison International, the utility's parent 
company. 
Southern California Edison has said it's willing to be flexible on the 
governor's plan, which calls for the state to buy Edison's transmission grid 
for $2.76 billion. Company officials wouldn't comment on the various 
alternatives. 
"We understand that the transmission deal is the subject of controversy and 
are open to variations on it,'' Bennett said. 
Steve Maviglio, Davis' spokesman, said the governor also remained committed 
to his deal. 
"Edison is going to survive,'' said Mitch Wilk, a member of the state Public 
Utilities Commission from 1986 through 1991 and a past president of the 
agency. But the question is "whether it will survive via the (plan) that the 
governor negotiated or they do the same kind of thing PG&E did." 
"There is still a very real risk that SCE will be forced into bankruptcy if 
the Legislature tinkers too much with the deal, or fails to move ahead 
promptly,'' Wilk said. 
PG&E chose to file Chapter 11 last month because it was dissatisfied with the 
progress of negotiations with Davis on a state rescue of the company. PG&E's 
move was an embarrassment for Davis, who had vowed to keep the state's big 
utilities solvent. 
"One of the principal chips Edison has with the state is not filing for 
bankruptcy,'' said Ed Feo, a lawyer involved with the PG&E case. "It would be 
a black eye for the state. As long as the company stays out of bankruptcy, 
they have something to trade." 
Edison's creditors are still waiting to see how the utility fares with the 
Legislature. Some have agreed to defer receiving payments until the end of 
June. 
Dean Vanech, president of New Jersey-based Carson Cogeneration, said a lot of 
things need to happen before he and other creditors feel ready to drag Edison 
into bankruptcy. 
"In general, we would have to feel like there was absolutely no hope in a 
deal being made,'' Vanech said. But, he admitted, "there's a concern that a 
resolution will not be put on the table in any reasonable period of 
time.''Meanwhile, Edison has vigorously lobbied the Legislature to approve 
the transmission deal. The company has launched a public-relations campaign 
to persuade the public that it is in its interest, said John Bryson, chief 
executive of Edison International. 
"Bankruptcy is a last resort,'' Bryson said in a recent interview. "We 
believe there will be a solution.'' 
But changes are necessary, said Senate Leader John Burton, D-San Francisco, 
"because people didn't like Plan A.'' 
Lawmakers cringed at some elements of the plan, which many thought was overly 
generous to Edison: limiting investigation of the utility's parent's company 
and guaranteeing the company an 11.6 percent annual return on investment. 
Alternatives include: requiring power generators to accept up to one-third 
less than the collective $3.5 billion they're owed; taxing Edison on its 
property and using the tax to pay off its debts; and allowing Edison to build 
more power plants. The latest proposal would require the state to sell bonds 
to pay off Edison's debts and give the state the option to buy the 
transmission lines later. Most of the proposals would require an extra 
surcharge on ratepayers bills to pay off debts. 
One hurdle the legislature faces: rallying two-thirds of each house behind 
one plan, necessary any time the state spends money. Republicans have been 
philosophically opposed to acquiring transmission lines, and half the 
alternatives include that element. 
But Stanford University professor James Sweeney thinks compromise is 
possible. Lawmakers and the utility will strike a deal simply because a 
second bankruptcy would tarnish the image of the state's political leaders. 
Sweeney believes, however, the outcome might be more fair in court. 
"Bankruptcies are messy ... but so is the political process,'' Sweeney said. 
"We're in a situation where the leadership (politically) seems not willing to 
bite the bullet. It may be better for our state to have a bankruptcy judge 
who is very strong and who isn't planning for a higher office.'' 














Long Beach obtains lien on Edison's assets 
The city is the fourth small supplier with an attachment on the utility. 
May 24, 2001 
By KATE BERRY
The Orange County Register 
The city of Long Beach became the fourth small power supplier to get a lien 
against the assets of Southern California Edison, a move that could push the 
utility closer to bankruptcy. 
Last week, Edison was ordered to freeze at least $9 million in bank accounts 
to cover payments owed to Long Beach for power Edison bought from the city's 
trash-to-energy plant. 
Getting a lien on the utility's assets ensures the city will be paid, even if 
the utility files for bankruptcy. 
Stephen Pickett, Edison International's general counsel, said the utility 
plans to appeal. 
Long Beach also is suing Edison International, the utility's parent company, 
for breach of contract, claiming the utility should not have transferred $4.7 
billion to its parent company over a four-year period beginning in 1996, when 
deregulation was implemented. 
"Edison International was required to honor the debts of its subsidiary,'' 
said Robert Shannon, Long Beach's city attorney. 
So far, Edison has been sued by 27 small power suppliers, known as qualifying 
facilities, or QFs. The lawsuits either seek to put a lien on the utility's 
assets to recover unpaid debts or attempt to terminate 20-year contracts to 
provide power to Edison. 
Edison owes QFs about $1 billion and is trying to combine the cases before a 
single judge in Los Angeles. 
But Long Beach differs from other power suppliers because it wants to stay in 
its contract with Edison. 
"We just want to be paid under our contract. We still want to deliver them 
power,'' said Shannon. 
As a municipality, Long Beach also did not have to post a bond to obtain a 
lien as the other QFs must. 
Ed Feo, a lawyer for wind, solar and biomass QFs, said liens on Edison's 
assets could have a domino effect. 
"Two things will accelerate a bankruptcy filing by Edison: Either the deal to 
sell its transmission lines (to the state) is going nowhere and alternatives 
are not acceptable - or if attachments are made to the company's property 
that the utility doesn't want to run the risk of losing.'' 
Three other QFs have posted bonds to obtain liens against Edison. They 
include Caithness Energy, which got a lien on Edison's 56 percent interest in 
two qualifying facilities that make up the Mohave Generating Station in 
Laughlin, Nev.; IMC Chemicals, a unit of IMC Global Inc. of Northbrook, Ill., 
and that won a $7 million lien; and Herber Geothermal Co. and Second Imperial 
Geothermal Co., which is owned by Covanta Energy Corp., a former unit of 
Ogden Corp., based in Fairfield, N.J. 













Poll: 59% in state favor nuclear power 
It's a reversal of views since the Three Mile Island accident. 
May 24, 2001 

The Associated Press 
Fifty-nine percent of Californians now support building more nuclear plants, 
according to a poll released Wednesday. 
The last time the Field Institute polled Californians about nuclear energy 
was 1984 - five years after the accident at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania 
- and it found 61 percent opposed to nuclear power. 
"In my interpretation, the current energy crisis has some bearing on the 
public's changed attitudes on nuclear power," said Mark DiCamillo, spokesman 
for the nonpartisan polling organization. 
"The public is searching for clean ways to add to the capacity." 
The Field poll comes as the Bush administration pushes for a renewed look at 
nuclear power. No utilities have ordered any new nuclear power plants in the 
United States since 1978. 
The poll of 1,015 California adults was taken May 11-20. The margin of error 
was plus or minus 3.2 percent. 
Carl Zichella, the Sierra Club's regional staff director, said Californians 
have not thought about nuclear energy for about 20 years and do not have as 
much information as they did around Three Mile Island. 
"I think this number really reflects a lack of knowledge on the part of the 
public about the problems that drove nuclear power underground," he said. 
"The more people know about nuclear power, the less they're going to like 
it." 
Getting a new nuclear plant built faces two major problems: financing and 
siting, said Rich Ferguson, research director for the Sacramento- based 
Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technology. 
"We have just not seen any interest in the financial community to invest the 
billions of dollars," he said. 






Filing for Hayward Project Includes Request for Expedited Review


PLEASANTON, Calif., May 23 /PRNewswire/ -- San Jose-based, Calpine
Corporation (NYSE: CPN) and San Francisco-based, Bechtel Enterprises Holdings,
Inc. today filed an Application For Certification (AFC) with the California
Energy Commission (CEC) for its proposed Russell City Energy Center in
Hayward, Calif.  The filing marks the beginning of an extensive CEC licensing
process required to build and operate an electricity generating facility in
California.  The filing included a request for expedited review that would
reduce the licensing review process period from 12 months to 6 months.


The proposed Russell City Energy Center would be a 600-megawatt, natural
gas-fired, combined-cycle electric generating facility located on
approximately 14 acres of land, zoned heavy industrial, at 3636 Enterprise
Avenue in Hayward.  The site is adjacent to the city of Hayward's wastewater
treatment plant, which would supply recycled water to the Energy Center. The
Russell City Energy Center would provide needed electricity for Hayward,
western Alameda County and the San Francisco Peninsula.


The modern technology used at the facility would allow for a greater than
90 percent reduction of certain emissions and is 40 percent more
fuel-efficient compared to older gas-fueled facilities in the Bay Area.


"The Russell City Energy Center will provide a vital new source of clean,
reliable electricity in the region," said Curt Hildebrand, vice president and
general manager of the Calpine/Bechtel Joint Development.  "We look forward to
working with the City of Hayward, Alameda County and the California Energy
Commission to develop a model Energy Center."


Submittal of the AFC represents the culmination of more than six months of
extensive engineering, technical and environmental studies.


"We are hopeful that the considerable groundwork that we have laid thus
far will make this project eligible for the six month CEC review process,"
Hildebrand added.  "We are seeking the expedited review to do everything we
can to help solve the state's energy crisis as quickly as possible."


Once the CEC determines that the application is complete, and determine
whether the project qualifies for the expedited review process, the official
review will begin.  As lead agency, the CEC will work with environmental and
government agencies in conducting its review and will hold local workshops and
hearings to encourage community participation. The expedited review process
would require the same environmental and technical standards as the longer
review period.  Based upon the successful licensing of the project,
construction could begin in summer of 2002, with commercial operation by
summer of 2004.


Copies of the AFC filings will be available through the CEC and at local
libraries. Summaries of the study will be posted on the Russell City Energy
Center website (www.russellcityenergycenter.com).  To receive additional
information on the CEC process, visit their website at www.energy.ca.gov.  For
more information on the Russell City Energy Center, call 510-704-8475.

California Governor Signs Bill to Speed Up Approval for Power Plants



LOS ANGELES, May 22, 2001 (Xinhua via COMTEX) -- Governor of California Gray
Davis on Tuesday signed a bill to speed up the process of approving 
construction
of new power plants as a way to fight the ongoing power shortage.

"California is in a war with energy producers, and the best long-term weapon 
is
to build more power plants," Davis said at a signing ceremony in Elk Grove,
California.


The bill will shorten the application process for a new or remodeled power
plant, as well as the time that local governments have to review proposals.


Davis said the new bill will speed up two energy projects that are in the
process right now, including a 900-megawatt plant in Palm Springs and a gas
storage project in Lodi that will store up to 12 billion cubic feet of natural
gas.


California has been suffering from a power crisis since last year, which has
caused repeated blackouts and sent the power rate spiraling.


The crisis is largely blamed on the 1996 deregulation law that forces the
utilities to buy electricity from the wholesale market at higher rates than 
they
charge the customers. And the repairs of generators in some power plants and 
the
warming weather have made things worse.


After the heavily indebted utilities could no longer afford to buying power
anymore, the state government has used more than 7 billion dollars of tax 
money
so far this year to buy electricity on behalf of them.


Among other measures to ease the power shortage, the state government has 
called
for residents to conserve electricity as much as they can, especially during 
the
peak-hours during the day.Residents have been told to brace for a worse
situation during the incoming summer.








From the Oakland Tribune 5/24
 
Lockyer: Probe may spark suit 
Criminal charges could follow evidence of price gouging 
By Steve Geissinger
SACRAMENTO BUREAU 
SACRAMENTO -- State Attorney General Bill Lockyer said Wednesday his 
investigation of alleged multibillion-dollar price gouging by power 
generators has laid the foundation for a successful civil case that could win 
huge refunds. 
"But the whole house hasn't been built," Lockyer said in an interview with 
ANG Newspapers. 
The attorney general said the probe he expects to complete in the next eight 
weeks also may yet yield criminal charges, which could result in power 
company officials being locked up "with my tattooed dude." 
Lockyer, a former East Bay legislator, rattled electricity suppliers earlier 
this week when he told the Wall Street Journal: "I would love to personally 
escort (Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth) Lay to an 8 x 10 cell that he could 
share with a tattooed dude who says, 'Hi, my name is Spike, honey.'" 
Houston-based Enron, like other energy-trading firms, has denied wrongdoing 
in the California market. It dismissed Lockyer's comment as not warranting a 
response butquietlyprotested to the Davis administration. Other power 
companies have expressed outrage. 
"I was trying to convey a message to ... the out-of-state energy generators," 
Lockyer said. "I decided to make the point with the energy generators that 
they've got a serious fight on their hands." 
The attorney general, however, conceded he has "felt guilty about it ever 
since because I'm a prosecutor and I take pride in being careful about these 
sorts of accusations or claims." 
"But I know it won't be in print unless I find some sort of colorful way to 
... pump up the rhetoric," he said. 
"We don't care if they're multi-millionaires. We don't care if they run big 
corporations. They're buccaneers. They're ripping us off. 
"Now, while we're still in the legal analysis of whether it's legal or 
illegal greed, it's clearly immoral. There's no debate about that." 
Lockyer said his investigators are scrutinizing tens of thousands of 
transactions and hundreds of thousands of documents to determine the strength 
of the state's case. 
"I think there is strong evidence that lays the foundation for a successful 
civil action, but the whole house hasn't been built," Lockyer said. 
A civil case could result in refunds that "disgorge the obscene profits," he 
said. 
The California Independent System Operator, which manages the state's 
electric transmission grid, estimates that power suppliers may have 
overcharged California by $6.8 billion since early last year. 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has so far tentatively ordered 
California suppliers to make only tens of millions of dollars in refunds as 
part of that agency's ongoing probe. 
Lockyer said criminal charges will be filed if investigators find that 
company officials intentionally engaged in unfair business practices. 
The attorney general said he hopes to complete the work within the next eight 
weeks despite what he called stalling tactics such as those by three energy 
firms -- Reliant and Dynegy of Houston and Mirant of Atlanta. 
The three companies agreed Tuesday to surrender copies of internal documents 
that had been subpoenaed two months ago by Lockyer as part of the probe. 
"They've been throwing $500-an-hour lawyers at us in high volume to drag 
their feet and stall our investigation," Lockyer said. 
The attorney general's comments come amid a flurry of lawsuits and 
allegations by California officials against power suppliers, as well as 
ongoing probes. 
Besides the attorney and FERC, the Legislature, state Public Utilities 
Commission, Cal-ISO and the California Electricity Oversight Board are all 
conducting investigations.

Davis to push backup diesel
By Chris Bowman
Bee Staff Writer
(Published May 24, 2001) 
In a major reversal of environmental policy, Gov. Gray Davis will announce a 
plan to relieve California's overloaded electricity grid this summer by 
paying businesses to run their high-polluting backup generators in advance of 
anticipated blackouts, a top energy adviser to the governor said Wednesday. 
"The backup generators will help us get through the summer," said S. David 
Freeman, who recently resigned as general manager of the Los Angeles 
Department of Water and Power to lead Davis' drive for energy conservation. 
Freeman said he would leave it to Davis to disclose details of the plan. 
"The governor will announce what he's going to do," he said Wednesday in a 
wide-ranging interview on energy issues with The Bee. 
Roger Salazar, the governor's deputy press secretary, would not confirm when 
or whether Davis would make such an announcement. 
"I don't know that the governor has signed off on anything like that," 
Salazar said. 
Under the plan, participating businesses would turn on backup generators and 
simultaneously disconnect from the electricity grid when power supplies are 
at Stage 3 -- nearly depleted. 
The state would pay the companies for the much-needed power that would be 
saved by converting to diesel generation. 
Deploying diesel-powered generators -- the dirtiest of internal combustion 
engines -- to forestall blackouts is another sign of the governor's struggle 
to get more megawatts flowing through California. 
Earlier this week Davis lowered his estimate of the amount of new power that 
will come on line this summer from 5,000 megawatts to 4,000 megawatts. A 
megawatt is enough power for 750 to 1,000 households. 
The diesel plan also marks a significant turnabout in the Davis 
administration's policy. 
The governor and his appointees at the state Air Resources Board uniformly 
have rejected such proposals from industries, utilities and the operator of 
the state's electricity grid, arguing that routine use of the backup diesels 
would endanger public health. 
San Diego Gas & Electric has one such proposal scheduled for a vote today by 
the Davis-appointed state Public Utilities Commission. 
Environmentalists who have been catching word of the Davis plan this week 
argue that it would shatter the governor's repeated promises to stand firm on 
air quality standards during the energy crisis. 
A letter signed Wednesday by several of the state's leading environmental 
organizations, including the American Lung Association of California, urged 
Davis to reconsider. 
"Given your awareness of the public health threats of diesel emissions, 
please stop and have these proposals considered in a more thoughtful and 
public manner," the letter states. 
Freeman argued, however, that the additional health threat from non-emergency 
use of diesel generators is "marginal" compared with the health and safety 
problems triggered by power outages. 
"This is a no-brainer," Freeman said. "You've got human lives at stake here. 
This is a scary situation." 
Freeman cited, for example, people on life-support systems that could go awry 
in blackouts. 
But Sandra Spelliscy, attorney for the environmentalist Planning and 
Conservation League, countered, "If the health impacts are so marginal, why 
has the governor's own air quality enforcement agency opposed this?" 
Industries ranging from hospitals to food processing plants and data 
management centers have diesel-powered generators -- some the size of 
locomotives -- that kick on when a storm or earthquake knocks out power. 
Unlike diesel-powered trucks and buses, most diesel standby generators run 
with little or no pollution controls because they are intended only for 
emergencies. 
Though the latest models run cleaner and more efficiently, most generators in 
use today produce about 500 times more emissions of smog-forming nitrogen 
oxides per megawatt-hour as a new natural gas-fired power plant, according to 
air board engineers. Further, the diesels spew high amounts of breathable 
soot particles that can cause cancer, the engineers say. 
Davis' plan would limit the use of the generators to days when the grid 
operator declares a Stage 3 alert, meaning the power supplies are running low 
and rolling blackouts may be ordered to keep the state's entire grid from 
collapsing, according to Freeman. 
Salazar, the governor's spokesman, said only, "Any backup generation 
involving diesel will have to be used as a last resort to prevent blackouts." 
Environmentalists who are trying to head off the plan said it would have the 
state paying participating businesses at least 35 cents per kilowatt-hour, 
roughly three times the rate consumers typically pay for electricity. Freeman 
would not confirm the pay rate. 
The Davis administration has offered generators willing to sell new power 
exclusively to the state 50 percent discounts on the air emission credits 
they would need to comply with smog rules. 
For operators of existing power plants, the governor has agreed to have 
taxpayers pay the entire cost of polluting above allowable limits in order to 
keep the lights on. 
The latest plan to pay companies to run the dirty diesels during energy 
alerts further loosens the environmental reins.

Bush-Davis meeting set for energy crisis
By David Whitney
Bee Washington Bureau
(Published May 24, 2001) 
WASHINGTON -- President Bush will meet next week with Gov. Gray Davis to talk 
about California's worsening electricity crisis amid a shifting political 
dynamic on Capitol Hill that increasingly favors some controls on West Coast 
wholesale electricity prices. 
Details for the Bush-Davis meeting were still being worked out Wednesday, but 
the fact that the Republican president is meeting with the Democratic 
governor, who is often mentioned as a possible challenger in 2004, was seen 
as a sign that the White House is facing increasing political heat on the 
energy issue. 
"California is a very big state," said White House spokesman Ari Fleischer. 
"It represents one-sixth of the United States. It's the sixth-largest economy 
in the world. And the president is very pleased to sit and talk with Governor 
Davis. It's important." 
Davis' spokesman, Steve Maviglio, said electricity price caps will be at the 
top of the governor's agenda for the meeting on Tuesday or Wednesday. But 
Fleischer did not commit the president to that kind of meeting. 
In his first visit to the state since the campaign last year, the president 
will spend Monday night in Los Angeles and Tuesday night in Fresno. 
Until now, the White House has steadfastly refused to meet with any elected 
Democrat from California about the energy crisis despite repeated pleas from 
the Democratic congressional delegation. 
Price controls have become the mantra of California Democratic lawmakers and 
a handful of Republicans, but the Bush administration has flatly dismissed 
them as counterproductive to increasing power generation in the 
megawatt-short state. 
In recent weeks, however, there has been a developing shift in the attitude 
toward price controls on Capitol Hill. Bush's two nominees to the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission, whose names were forwarded to the Senate floor 
Wednesday for confirmation, declined to rule out price controls once they are 
seated on the panel. 
And the apparent decision by Vermont Sen. James Jeffords to abandon the 
Republican Party would put Democrats in control of the Senate, moving Sen. 
Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico, a price-control advocate, to the helm of the key 
Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. 
California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a committee Democrat, said Wednesday that 
she has talked to Bingaman and that he committed to moving her legislation to 
temporarily peg wholesale prices to the cost of production. 
Four Republican House members from California have also endorsed some form of 
price-control legislation. 
On Wednesday, Rep. Doug Ose, R-Sacramento, announced that he is introducing a 
bill that, while not technically a price cap, would give greater price relief 
for West Coast consumers than federal regulators or the Bush administration 
have been willing to offer. 
Ose, chairman of the House Government Reform Committee's energy subcommittee, 
said his bill would extend throughout the West a price-mitigation plan 
approved last month by the FERC. But instead of that plan taking effect only 
during power emergencies as the commission directed, it would operate around 
the clock under Ose's bill to peg spot market prices at the cost of 
production of the least-efficient plant selling into the California market. 
Ose said his bill would encourage generators to sell their power through 
long-term contracts rather than on the volatile spot market. 
"I am looking for a middle ground," Ose said.

Energy Digest: GOP unveils plan to help utility
By Jim Sanders
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published May 24, 2001) 
State Assembly efforts to develop a bipartisan proposal to help Southern 
California Edison pay off massive debts and avoid bankruptcy hit a dead end 
Wednesday when Republicans released a plan of their own. 
The move could force Democrats to sidestep Republicans and vote along party 
lines on an alternative to Gov. Gray Davis' proposed $2.76 billion state 
purchase of power lines. 
Assembly Republican leader Dave Cox of Fair Oaks said Wednesday's split was 
necessary because there are few differences between the governor's plan and 
the Democrats' plan. 
The Republican plan rejects the notion of purchasing transmission lines or 
hydroelectric facilities. 
Key components call for dedicating a portion of consumer rates to allow 
Edison to pay off $3.5 billion in debts. In return, ratepayers would receive 
either an equity stake in future power plants or the right to purchase 
electricity at discount rates.






Few escape blame for crisis in poll
By Dan Smith
Bee Deputy Capitol Bureau Chief
(Published May 24, 2001) 
Utility companies and out-of-state power generators continue to get the 
lowest marks for their performance in California's energy crisis, but Gov. 
Gray Davis' grades have slipped dramatically over the past five months, 
according to a Field Poll released Wednesday. 
And Californians, it turns out, blame plenty of people for the state's power 
woes -- except themselves. 
Every player in the power drama gets poor marks except "residential energy 
consumers," which 39 percent of poll respondents say are doing a good or very 
good job to improve the energy situation. Only 22 percent think they are 
doing a poor or very poor job. 
Public opinion of residential consumers' efforts has improved since January, 
when 32 percent thought they were doing a poor job and only 26 percent gave 
them high marks. 
"The public sees themselves as conserving energy," said Field Poll Director 
Mark DiCamillo. "That's the only positive movement in the survey." 
For Davis, who faces re-election next year, the movement is far from 
positive. 
In the January poll, the Democratic governor received good marks from 41 
percent of those surveyed, average grades from 31 percent and poor ratings 
from only 22 percent. 
But when the Field Institute conducted its recent poll between May 11 and 
Sunday, opinions about Davis flip-flopped. After months of energy angst, a 
handful of power blackouts and two rate increases, only 27 percent think 
Davis is doing a good job, while 38 percent gave him failing grades. The poll 
also shows that Californians believe the crisis will continue by an average 
of a year and a half, well through the upcoming re-election battle. 
"All the rhetoric Davis used with some positive effect early on is not going 
over well any more," DiCamillo said. "The public is starting to view this as 
a long-term problem, not some temporary policy shift." 
Still, Davis fares far better than his adversaries in the crisis -- President 
Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney and the energy industry. 
The public's view of energy interests, which was pretty dim in January, drops 
even lower in the May poll. Utility companies received bad ratings from half 
the public in January, but 57 percent now believe they are doing a poor or 
very poor job. Out-of-state energy generators, whom Davis has accused of 
gouging ratepayers, fell from 44 percent low ratings in January to 55 percent 
in the May poll. 
Bush, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the state Public Utilities 
Commission are not far behind, drawing poor grades from more than half the 
public. Cheney, the architect of Bush's energy proposal, received low ratings 
from 43 percent. The January Field Poll did not ask about Bush and Cheney 
because they had not yet taken office. 
Davis has repeatedly bashed FERC for not imposing wholesale price caps on 
electricity, and has called Cheney "grossly misinformed" on the state's 
energy problems. Cheney, in turn, has called Davis' energy proposals 
"harebrained" and "goofy." 
The state Legislature receives poor marks from 41 percent of those polled, 
while only 16 percent believe it is doing a good job.

New views emerging on power
More elected officials support the concept of planned blackouts
By John Hill
Bee Capitol Bureau 
(Published May 23, 2001)

If Californians are to be left in the dark, they should at least know when to 
break out the candles or send the workers home. 
That's the growing sentiment among a range of elected officials, including 
Gov. Gray Davis, who are pushing the idea of planning power blackouts and 
giving businesses and residents ample warning. 
On Tuesday, the Democratic governor's office said Davis supports longer 
public notice than the 24 hours called for under a proposal by the California 
Independent System Operator, which runs the state's power grid. 
Assemblyman Mike Briggs, R-Fresno, introduced a bill that would lay out a 
blackout schedule for the summer. Businesses could make plans for the 
possible blackout days and also be assured that on all other days the lights 
would stay on. 
Briggs called his plan an improvement on the existing system in which "every 
day is a potential blackout day." 
A Senate committee, meanwhile, discussed planned blackouts as part of a 
strategy to gain leverage over electricity generators by declaring that the 
state will not pay above a certain amount for power. The state would ask 
Washington and Oregon to join the so-called "buyers' cartel." 
If the power generators refused to sell at the lower prices, the state would 
gut it out with planned blackouts. 
"Let's use the blackouts against the generators," Michael Shames, head of the 
San Diego-based Utility Consumers' Action Network, told the Energy, Utilities 
and Communications Committee. But Shames and others stressed the need for 
warnings of at least 12 hours and blackouts no longer than 90 minutes. 
"Absent that management of blackouts, we don't see how the buyers' cartel 
could work," Shames said. 
On a visit to Chicago on Monday, Davis said he talked to officials about the 
city's system for giving the public warning days before possible power 
blackouts, with definite notice right before. 
"There is no reason to keep that secret from the public when their safety is 
likely to be jeopardized," Davis told reporters Tuesday. The governor said he 
plans to meet in the next few days with managers at ISO to explore the idea 
of a system like Chicago's. 
The grid operator announced Monday that it will try to give the public at 
least a half-hour notice of outages, but many officials said Tuesday the 
public needs even more warning. Davis aides said the governor's plan will go 
beyond ISO's. 
There are potential pitfalls. Criminals might make their own plans, taking 
advantage of deactivated alarms. And some say that a schedule of blackouts 
might increase the number of outages. 
If people have been warned that a blackout is coming, and a last-minute 
supply of electricity makes it unnecessary, grid managers would have to 
decide whether to call it off, said Dorothy Rothrock, vice president of the 
California Manufacturers & Technology Association. 
If they did, it would add uncertainty to future warnings, she said, possibly 
leading them to order unnecessary blackouts. 
"Obviously, there are trade-offs," Rothrock said. 
Still, the idea of planning blackouts seems to be gaining ground as a way for 
the state to get back some control of the energy crisis, sorely lacking in 
recent months. 
"It would help us as Californians to say, 'The hell with you, George Bush, 
we're going to handle this ourselves,' " said Jim Overman, 68, of Elk Grove. 
Overman said he has been burning up the phone lines trying to persuade anyone 
who will listen that scheduled blackouts will make everyone's lives easier. 
Briggs said he has been told by constituents, including irrigators and food 
processors, that scheduled blackouts are the way to go. 
Irrigators would know that they shouldn't plan on getting water on a day that 
their electronic gates might be closed. 
Businesses could tell workers to stay home on a blackout day, or arrange for 
backup power generators, he said. 
"We would be very interested in it," said Ed Yates, senior vice president of 
the California League of Food Processors. 
Power blackouts are chaotic for processing plants, Yates said, requiring some 
plants to be re-sterilized and shutting down operations for more than a day. 
Some processors might choose to close on days when they faced a blackout, he 
said, losing revenue but avoiding the loss of thousands of pounds of food. 
"It doesn't solve the problem, but it helps manage a very difficult 
situation," he said. 
Briggs said that his plan would result in possible blackout days every two 
weeks. The plan would assume that a certain number of customers would have to 
turned off to keep the grid operating. If the electricity shortage went above 
that amount, people might still face unanticipated blackouts, Briggs said. 
One question is public safety. Some are queasy about burglars knowing when 
blackouts will occur. But pluses include the ability to arrange for temporary 
stop signs at road intersections, or families being able to arrange for a 
sick relative to be moved. 
"If the police have only five minutes notice, they can't get to difficult 
intersections to direct traffic, they can't help paramedics, fire departments 
and ambulances get where they have to be," Davis said. 
The manufacturers' association and other business groups haven't endorsed the 
idea yet, but say it's worth a look. 
"It's preferable to random, rolling blackouts," Rothrock said.

Californians' priorities for solving the crisis are outlined in a Field Poll
?Related graphic

Bee Deputy Capitol Bureau Chief 
(Published May 23, 2001)

Californians have some clear ideas on how to solve the energy crisis: build 
more nuclear power plants, cap the wholesale price of electricity and relax 
air-quality standards to allow older plants to be upgraded. 
And, according to a Field Poll released Tuesday, they're not so hot on the 
recently approved $13.4 billion bond authorization to pay for electricity, or 
the idea of Gov. Gray Davis seizing power plants through eminent domain. 
Poll architects said responses may be somewhat colored by respondents' 
unfamiliarity with all the issues or skepticism on the causes of the state's 
power woes. Nearly 60 percent said it essentially is an artificial crisis 
created by power companies to make money. 
But on one longstanding issue -- nuclear power -- the poll showed a clear 
preference and a dramatic shift in public opinion. 
In the highest recorded support for nuclear power in California since before 
the Three Mile Island disaster in 1979, 59 percent say they favor more 
nuclear plants in the state to provide electricity. 
Support among registered voters grows to 61 percent, with 33 percent opposed. 
Among Democrats, 53 percent support more nuclear plants, and three-fourths of 
Republicans and 55 percent of others agree. 
"The change in attitude is very significant because they know this issue," 
Field Poll Director Mark DiCamillo said. 
Californians' support for nuclear power reached nearly 70 percent in the 
mid-1970s in the aftermath of a nationwide energy crisis. But it plummeted to 
37 percent in 1979 after the partial meltdown at Pennsylvania's Three Mile 
Island plant and fell to 33 percent in 1984 -- the last time Field surveyed 
the question. 
In 1989, voters demanded that the Sacramento Municipal Utility District's 
Rancho Seco nuclear plant be shut down. The utility complied and has spent 
more than $200 million decommissioning it during the past 12 years. 
Although the poll results are in line with some private surveys done recently 
by nuclear-energy advocates, opponents say the Field Poll opinions could be 
misleading because the issue has been dormant for so long. Not since the late 
'70s has an application for a nuclear plant been filed in the United States. 
Only two operate in California -- San Onofre in San Diego County and Diablo 
Canyon in San Luis Obispo. 
"When the (poll) questions are on issues that people haven't thought about 
that much lately, you do get some aberrant results," said Bill Magavern, a 
lobbyist for the Sierra Club. "People right now are obviously concerned about 
electricity, but they haven't really thought about what it would be like to 
have a nuclear power plant in the neighborhood." 
The Field Poll results lend support to at least one aspect in the national 
energy plan recently released by President Bush, who called for more nuclear 
power plants nationwide. 
But poll respondents were even more insistent that the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission should impose caps on wholesale energy prices despite 
opposition from the Bush administration. The poll showed 70 percent of all 
adults and 68 percent of registered voters -- including 57 percent of Bush's 
fellow Republicans -- support the price controls. 
"It really does expose the Bush administration to long-term serious problems 
in California if they're perceived as not willing to help the state in this 
regard," DiCamillo said. "The public really thinks (price caps) should be 
imposed." 
Republicans in the survey support price caps despite Bush opposition, and 
Democrats narrowly oppose the move by Democratic lawmakers and Davis to 
authorize the largest bond sale in national history to pay for power 
purchases. 
Among all adults, 38 percent approve of the move, and 52 percent oppose it. 
Democrats disapprove of the bonds by a 46 percent to 44 percent margin. 
Californians' desire for clean air is softening in the face of the energy 
crunch, respondents said. 
By a margin of 51 percent to 41 percent, poll respondents say they would 
maintain air-quality standards rather than relax them to build plants. That 
support is down from a Field survey in January, when 59 percent said they'd 
rather maintain standards. Moreover, a majority (53 percent) say they would 
relax air-quality standards to get older plants back in operation, an 
increase from 47 percent in January. 
Slight majorities support a state-run public power authority (54 percent) and 
state-owned power transmission lines (51 percent), but DiCamillo said that 
some poll respondents were probably not familiar with all the implications of 
those moves. 
Responses to the idea of Davis seizing power plants if prices continue to 
rise this summer fell somewhat down partisan lines, with Democrats in favor, 
50 percent to 42 percent, and Republicans opposed, 52 percent to 32 percent. 
Overall, the idea was rejected by 48 percent of adults and favored by 44 
percent. 
A strong majority of registered voters, 56 percent, oppose additional 
offshore oil and gas drilling to ease the energy crunch, and 38 percent favor 
it.

Offshore drilling waits in the wings


(Published May 23, 2001)

WASHINGTON -- The release today of a piece of President Bush's energy policy 
has California lawmakers squirming. 
A natural gas advisory panel is set to unveil a 56-page report looking at 
whether moratoriums on offshore oil and gas development should be lifted. It 
will also name specific sites for possible drilling. 
Rep. Anna Eschoo, D-Palo Alto, said Tuesday that if the Bush administration 
tries to undo moratoriums protecting more than 170 million acres off the 
California coast, it would be like "targeting a missile at us." 
So far, the Bush administration hasn't taken any direct action. The energy 
policy he released last week calls for more oil and gas development, but its 
only recommendation about offshore drilling was that the secretaries of 
interior and commerce re-examine current laws and executive orders "to 
determine if changes are needed." 
Today's report is to urge selection of five of the most promising gas 
prospects in offshore areas covered by moratoriums in a pilot program aimed 
at eventual drilling. The report doesn't say where those five pilot areas 
should be. But Reps. Lois Capps, D-Santa Barbara, and Mike Thompson, D-Napa, 
are fearful that Morro Bay in San Louis Obispo County and the Eel River Basin 
in Humboldt County in their districts are likely choices.

Bush, Davis to meet, discuss state's energy crisis 

By Finlay Lewis
COPLEY NEWS SERVICE 
May 23, 2001 
WASHINGTON ) After weeks of holding California and its electricity crisis at 
arm's length, President Bush will plunge into the problem next week during a 
two-day visit to the state that will include a possible energy summit with 
California Gov. Gray Davis. 
White House press secretary Ari Fleischer told reporters Wednesday that the 
state's energy crisis will be "at the top of the list" when the president and 
the governor meet. The president's aides said that the time and place for the 
meeting are still being worked out. 
Bush's visit to the state will be his first since last fall's campaign. With 
their party enjoying only a slim majority in the U.S. House, some California 
Republicans have expressed dismay over their state's absence from the 
president's extensive post-inaugural travel schedule, fearing that the energy 
crisis could cost some GOP lawmakers their seats in next year's elections. 

Fleischer's announcement Wednesday of the meeting with Davis and its emphasis 
on energy caught many by surprise because the White House had given no hint 
until then that the president would address the issue during his upcoming 
trip to California. 
However, Davis called the White House on Tuesday night proposing a meeting 
with the president specifically to discuss energy. 
He followed up with two letters on Wednesday expressing the need for quicker 
action on the energy front: "Californians can't afford to wait four or five 
years for a permanent solution. We need relief today." 
In the longer of two letters, Davis wrote: "You and I don't agree on 
everything. But here's something we do have in common: we both inherited an 
energy mess. And the people that elected us expect us to clean it up." 
Davis also offered in the letters to "introduce" Bush to "business owners and 
everyday citizens who have been personally affected by this energy crisis." 
Fleischer said Wednesday that Bush would meet with "business leaders and 
energy consumers." 
Asked who initiated the meeting with Davis, Fleischer suggested the 
president's schedule had been drawn up independently of Davis' suggestions. 
"This is a case of they both want to meet with each other, and we're very 
pleased to be able to make it work out," he said. 
As for the meeting with the business leaders, Fleischer said, "The president 
has several events on his schedule that already include business leaders and 
energy consumers, and so it very well may happen that we're each suggesting 
similar things, which would be a healthy sign." 
Bush's itinerary also includes a stop on Tuesday at the Camp Pendleton Marine 
Corps Base designed to showcase his order directing the military to cut their 
energy use by 10 percent at California facilities. 
Fleischer said that the president wanted "to talk about how the federal 
government is going to be a strong partner to the state of California in the 
cause of energy conservation to help ease the burden in California as they go 
through the summer months when demand is high and blackouts are most at 
risk." 
The White House released an outline of the president's California itinerary 
on Tuesday afternoon. It indicated that the visit would not give prominent 
attention to the state's energy woes. 
Fleischer declined to say whether the president would expand on his energy 
plan in any way while in California. 
Davis and other California Democrats have been sharply critical of the Bush 
administration for failing to take decisive action to help alleviate the 
electricity shortage's toll on the state and its citizens. 
They are backing legislation due to come to a key vote on Thursday before the 
House Energy and Commerce Committee that would cap electricity rates in the 
state. The administration and most of the state's Republican lawmakers oppose 
the measure. 
Last week, Bush showcased an administration task force report on the nation's 
energy challenges that stressed long-range solutions focused mainly on 
increasing the supply of fossil fuels and an expanded role for nuclear power. 
The report also suggested incentives to encourage energy conservation and 
greater fuel efficiency. 
Bush's trip will begin on Monday when he flies from a Memorial Day event in 
Arizona to Los Angeles where he will spend the night. He will return to 
Washington on Wednesday night after a visit to the Fresno area. 
Bush assumed office despite losing the nation's most populous state by a 
decisive margin and then launched into the most ambitious travel schedule of 
any modern president. It included stops in 27 states ) not California.

California Democrats seek price caps on electricity

By Finlay Lewis
COPLEY NEWS SERVICE 
May 22, 2001 
WASHINGTON ) Accusing power generators of price gouging, a group of 
California House Democrats vowed Tuesday to try again this week to legislate 
price caps in order to bring down the energy bills in the state. 
Rep. Henry Waxman, a Los Angeles Democrat and author of the price-cap 
measure, said he would offer the measure as an amendment on Thursday. At that 
time the House Energy and Commerce Committee plans to complete work on a bill 
designed to reduce the number of blackouts expected in California this summer 
due to shortages in the supply of electrical power. 
Waxman and other Democrats seized on Republican fund-raising events on Monday 
and Tuesday nights involving President Bush and Vice President Cheney, 
charging the Republican administration with exacerbating the California 
situation by doing the bidding of the oil and gas industry in return for 
campaign contributions. 
"This is a contrived crisis in order to wreck our environmental protection 
laws," Waxman said. "It is a contrived crisis in order to produce 1000 
percent increases in profits for some of these generators." 
On the agenda when the committee meets Thursday will be a bill by Rep. Joe 
Barton, R-Texas, that would allow California Gov. Gray Davis to temporarily 
waive some air pollution limits to increase power production in the state 
when blackouts are imminent. 
It also would include: 
  federal help to ease a power transmission bottleneck in the Central Valley; 
  mandated power savings at federal facilities; 
  state discretion in adjusting daylight savings time; 
  an easing of the ties of some small, independent power generators to large 
utilities. 
Earlier this month, a subcommittee chaired by Barton rejected Waxman's 
price-cap amendment as some California Republicans complained that the idea 
of limiting power rates was politically inspired and would do nothing to 
solve California's crisis. 
The Bush administration and the energy industry oppose price caps, saying 
that such an approach would distort the market and worsen the electricity 
shortage in California and many other western states by discouraging 
exploration and production. 
Waxman's plan would require federal regulators in many cases to tie wholesale 
power rates to production costs, plus a "reasonable" profit. 
At the press conference, Rep. Bob Filner, D-San Diego, derided Republican 
opposition to price caps. 
Referring to wholesale power generators, Filner argued, "They were making 
money at $30 a megawatt; now they are charging up to $2,000. Believe me: They 
can make money off the market with a cost-base rate. They have done it for 
100 years. They can continue doing it." 
Rep. Jane Harman, D-Redondo Beach, said that California Republicans on the 
energy committee would suffer politically if they give into pressure from 
party leaders to oppose the price-cap bill. 
"There are no party affiliations for rate payers," said Harman, a committee 
member. "Republicans and Democrats have both seen the gouging of their rates 
in California." 





Mexico: No limit on number of new plants to be built 



Energy chief says 'anyone who requests a permit will get it'
By Diane Lindquist 
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER 
May 22, 2001 
Mexican Energy Secretary Ernesto Martens said yesterday that Mexico won't set 
any limit on the number of power plants in Baja California supplying 
electricity north of the border. 
"Since there's a window of opportunity here because of the need in California 
for electricity, anyone who requests a permit will get it," Martens said 
after speaking at the Institute of the Americas' 10th annual Latin American 
Energy Conference in La Jolla. 
Power plant construction in Baja California has become one of the most 
immediate solutions to California's electricity shortfalls. At least three 
plants being built in Baja California in the next four years will send 
electricity north of the border, where blackouts have interrupted normal 
activity. 
One facility, a Sempra Energy Corp. power plant near Mexicali, will export 
all of its electrical output to consumers north of the border. The San Diego 
company's project gained quick approval from Mexican authorities because the 
facility is not subject to restrictions imposed on private companies that 
supply electricity to the Mexican market. 
Other Mexican energy officials have said several other enterprises are 
interested in building similar facilities in Baja California. 
Such a mushrooming of projects is prompting concern on both sides of the 
border that the plants might have harmful effects on natural resources and 
public health and safety. 
In his speech, Martens emphasized Mexico's commitment to preserving the 
environment and local communities. 
But afterward, he said Mexico will approve any number of Baja California 
projects to serve California consumers. 
"I don't see any limit. The only limit is the ability of the interconnecting 
lines to transmit the electricity that is produced," he said. 
With a capacity of only 400 megawatts each, the two transmission 
interconnections linking the electricity grids of California and Baja 
California will not be able to transmit all of the 1,500 megawatts of 
electricity for the California market produced by the new Baja California 
plants -- let alone any additional facilities. 
Sempra, whose San Diego Gas & Electric subsidiary owns both the 
interconnecting lines, plans to upgrade the interconnector near Mexicali, 
spokesman Michael Clark said yesterday. The improvement will transmit 
electricity from Sempra's plant in Baja California to the company substation 
in Imperial Valley. The other connection links San Diego and Tijuana. 
Clark said he doesn't know how the other companies building Baja California 
plants plan to transmit their electricity. Representatives of the firms could 
not be reached yesterday. 
Even if the companies find a way to send electricity across the border, the 
California grid system presents another obstacle. 
To prepare for the possibility of more demands on the Southern California 
grid, the Imperial Irrigation District is analyzing what capacity it has for 
transmitting supplies on its lines and how to assess tariffs for the service. 
"It's become very important because of our proximity to Mexico," said 
district spokesman Ron Hull. 
The ability to transmit electricity is only one force limiting plant 
construction in Baja California. Another is the supply of fuel to drive the 
facilities. 
Sempra again is a key player in this area. It plans to build a North Baja 
Pipeline that will supply natural gas to its own and two other power plants 
in Baja California and the proposed Otay Mesa plant in San Diego. The 
pipeline won't provide fuel for any other facilities. 
"It's fully subscribed," said Clark. "In the future if there is enough 
demand, the compression could be increased." 
Energy Secretary Martens, however, hinted at the possibility of new natural 
gas supplies in Baja California. He said Mexico wants liquified natural gas 
facilities to be built in Rosarito Beach and Ensenada. 
While several companies have expressed an interest in such an operation, 
Martens' comments were the first to indicate that two, and not one, might be 
approved for Baja California. 




Potential governor candidate launches Northern California tour

(05-24) 00:01 PDT LIVERMORE, Calif. (AP) -- 
Republican William E. Simon Jr. says he won't decide until the first week of 
June whether to jump into the race for governor, although he appeared to be 
campaigning for the job this week. 
Trailed by a group of reporters Wednesday, the wealthy Pacific Palisades 
investment banker visited Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and took a 
few jabs at both Democratic Gov. Gray Davis and his potential GOP primary 
opponent, Secretary of State Bill Jones. 
"I think there's a leadership crisis in Sacramento," said Simon, who 
criticized Davis' handling of the state's power crisis. 
"You have the same elected people today trying to figure out a solution to 
the crisis that got us into the crisis," Simon said. 
Pressed to explain how he would end the crisis that has brought rolling 
blackouts and soaring power bills, Simon said he still is preparing his own 
plan. 
The son of Ford administration Treasury Secretary William E. Simon insisted 
he has yet to make a final decision on whether to run in 2002, adding he 
would make up his mind by June 4 after consulting with his family. 
Asked if he has any ties to companies profiting from the power crisis, Simon 
said he owns a "small piece" of a Texas-based company that makes equipment 
used in extracting or processing oil and natural gas. 
Before founding his investment banking firm with his father in 1988 he was an 
assistant U.S. attorney in New York. 
Simon started forming a campaign team in March, including John Herrington, 
former U.S. energy secretary under President Reagan and former chairman of 
the state Republican Party. 
Of potential primary opponent Jones, Simon said: "He seems like a perfectly 
nice fellow. ... I just don't think that he provides the contrast to Gray 
Davis that I do."

POLL: Californians dissatisfied with government handling of energy crisis

(05-24) 06:22 PDT SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- 
Over the past four months, Californians have developed increasingly negative 
feelings toward state and federal officials and agencies involved in 
California's energy crisis, according to a Field Poll released Thursday. 
A large number of those surveyed are also fearful that Pacific Gas & 
Electric's bankruptcy filing will make it more difficult for the company to 
provide service to its customers. 
Fifty-seven percent of those questioned in May by the Field Institute, a San 
Francisco-based nonpartisan polling organization, gave California's private 
electric utilities a poor rating. That's more than the 40 percent of 
respondents who rated the utilities performance as poor in January. 
The same negative feelings held true for out-of-state energy providers. 
Fifty-five percent of respondents this month rated their performance as poor, 
a noticeable increase from the 44 percent of respondents who gave them a poor 
rating in January. 
Specifically, those surveyed were asked to rate the job being done by 
officials and groups working to improve the energy situation in the state. 
The poll found that: 
* The percentage of those surveyed who gave the state Public Utilities 
Commission a poor rating rose from 42 percent in January to 52 percent in 
May. 
* 41 percent of those surveyed gave the state legislature a poor rating in 
May, as opposed 36 percent in January. 
* 38 percent gave Gov. Gray Davis a poor rating in May for his handling of 
the state's energy woes, a sharp increase from 22 percent who gave him a poor 
rating in January. 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission also drew negative ratings from 
respondents. In May, 52 percent said FERC was doing a poor job, as opposed to 
40 percent who gave the commission a rating of poor in January. 
Those surveyed were also asked if PG&E's bankruptcy would make it more 
difficult for the company to supply electricity to customers, and 49 percent 
said they thought it would. 
The poll, which questioned 1,015 California adults between May 11 and May 20, 
has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points, the institute 
said.

Energy crisis to cast long shadow 
A look at what energy crisis means to future

NS121240.DTL&type=news 
What we need to do is tune in, turn off and drop out. 
Tune in to how you use energy. Turn off those things that use electricity. 
And drop out of the power grid by using alternative power sources and 
alternatives to power sources. 
That's the only thing we can do in the short term. 
In the long term, you can almost see what will be coming down the pike. 
As the state's energy problems worsen, as the state throws its surplus down a 
rathole, as our own utility bills skyrocket and as blackouts roll across the 
state, someone will write a statewide ballot initiative and get it on the 
ballot. 
It will do two things. 
First, it will undo the deregulation of the state's energy industry. It will 
try to put everything back the way it was. 
Second, it will punish the producers of power and energy. 
It will levy some new fee or tax or it will regulate the industry as a public 
utility or it will require that the state take over the industry entirely. 
Huge amounts of money will be spent against it. Opponents will outspend 
supporters by a substantial amount. 
TV ads will run constantly, predicting dire consequences if the initiative is 
approved. 
We'll be told it will be bad for business. Labor leaders will tell us that it 
will cost jobs. Experts will say it will have no effect on the problem, or 
make the problem worse. 
All of that will probably be true. 
The initiative will pass easily. 
It will pass because it will appear to address what are widely understood as 
the two main causes of the current energy crisis -- a badly bungled 
deregulation and unbelievably greedy energy producers. 
It will pass because the initiative's authors will understand that most of us 
are furious about the way this mess was created and that we're eager to take 
it out on the industry leaders we see as the leading villains. 
It will pass precisely because all the people who will tell us it shouldn't 
are the people who got us into this disaster in the first place, and we won't 
believe them. 
It's much harder to say whether the energy crisis will have more immediate 
political repercussions for some of the elected officials we might blame for 
the problem -- such as the state Legislature and Gov. Davis, who could have 
done something about this a year ago and chose not to. 
Yes, the latest polls make it clear that Californians are furious with Davis 
and the Legislature. 
But elections for office are not yes/no propositions -- you don't get to vote 
up or down on Davis. 
They are a contest between two major party candidates, which means elections 
are always a matter of comparisons -- Davis compared with his opponent. 
Someone has to come along and convince voters he or she can do the job better 
than Davis. 
There might, indeed, be such people. It's unlikely one of those people will 
appear on the ballot in 2002, however. 
The current political landscape is heavily populated with profiles in 
discouragement -- people who, fearful of losing, lack the nerve to run 
against a well-financed incumbent. 
The great irony here is that voters thought term limits would solve that 
problem -- rather than being stuck with a well-financed incumbent, we'd force 
him out of office. 
In reality, we're stuck with the well-financed incumbent until his term 
limits are up -- in six or eight years. 
That does nothing to solve the problems that might arise in those six to 
eight years. It has done nothing to embolden would-be candidates. Now, they 
just meekly wait their turn. 
And it has made a shambles of the legislative process by populating the 
Capitol with people who don't know what they're doing, only where they're 
going next. Meanwhile, the people who do know what they're doing have been 
kicked out office. 
It's no coincidence that the deregulation mess was made in a Legislature full 
of people elected during the term-limit era. 
A statewide initiative, brave candidates, ending term limits -- those are all 
things that will happen in the future. 
Right now, it's time to tune in, turn off and drop out. 
Tune in to what you are doing as an individual consumer -- cast a critical 
eye at your own habits. 
Turn off your appliances, your lights, your air conditioner and reduce your 
individual energy consumption. It's much easier than it appears. 
Energy consumption has dropped in my household by more than a third by 
switching off some lights, converting to fluorescent light bulbs, turning 
down the refrigerator and connecting some appliances to a power strip, so 
that they truly are turned off. 
Finally, drop out of the power grid. Look for other ways to power your home 
-- most notably solar power, which is readily available. 
Find other alternatives to high-consumption appliances, such as clotheslines. 
Drop out. 
They can't gouge you if they can't get to you.

Power tips 
Chronicle readers' suggestions for coping with California's energy crisis

I live in Sacramento, where we do use air-conditioning in the summer. I 
covered two skylights with aluminum foil to keep the heat out. Two east- 
facing windows have exterior roll-up blinds. . . . I adjusted my pool pump 
from six hours per day to two hours from 6 to 8 a.m. This saves electricity 
and puts the usage in the morning, which is not the peak usage. I keep my 
computer power strip and music/VCR power strip switched off. This alone saves 
about one kilowatt hour per day. I replaced four of my most used lights with 
fluorescent bulbs. You really don't need to change all of your bulbs, just 
the ones that are on for several hours per day. So far, I've cut about 
one-third of my usage, with very little lifestyle change. 
Martin R. Fraser 
Sacramento 
Household air conditioners are energy guzzlers. Consider, instead, the merits 
of an evaporative cooler (a.k.a. swamp cooler), ideal in low-humidity locales 
such as California. They consume only about 25 percent of what it would take 
to operate an air conditioner. 
Martha Kimmich 
Walnut Creek 
The suggestion that a frost-free refrigerator's compressor will run less if 
ice cubes are put in Tupperware because it won't waste energy trying to 
"defrost" trays of ice cubes is pure nonsense. The duration of the defrost 
cycle is controlled by a timer, which turns on a heater for a fixed duration 
of time daily. Putting ice in Tupperware will, in fact, prevent the cubes 
from "evaporating" (technically - sublimating) as they do when left in their 
trays for long periods, and as such is a good idea - but not because the 
compressor will run less. 
Jack Petit 
The five major league baseball teams in California need to move to a day- 
only schedule for the rest of the year. That will also mean no Monday night 
games for the NFL teams this fall or winter. . . . No more private and public 
tennis clubs leaving their lights on their courts late into the night. . . . 
Attempt to combine or limit the venues in which public meetings are held. 
Often these halls are overly well-lighted, with only a few citizens 
attending. Reduce hours amusement parks are opened, and reduce the amount of 
lighting in underused areas. Limit the hours movie theaters are open. The 
matinees are sparsely attended, but use a lot of power to light and cool the 
theater. 
Hugh Cavanaugh 
When is San Francisco going to catch up with the rest of America and begin to 
install high-density sodium vapor lamps (the "yellow light") in place of all 
of its outside public lighting? They use one-third the energy of "white 
light" and put out three times the light. Also, if the state would give 
building owners a tax incentive to install "motion sensor"-controlled 
lighting systems, all these empty office buildings' lights could safely be 
shut off at night when these large buildings are empty. 
Rollin W. Roberts 
Require that all businesses keep their doors shut when open for business. One 
day recently on upper Market Street when it was 55 degrees and windy, I took 
a tally and 60 percent of the businesses had their doors open. 
Bill Choisser 
San Francisco 
After your dishwasher has completed the wash cycle, open the door, pull out 
the racks and there will be a big whoosh of steam. The hot temperature of the 
dishes and glasses themselves (from the wash cycle) creates instant 
evaporation. In a minute your dishes are dry and cool. The only reason for a 
drying cycle is because they're enclosed. 
Dan Lucas 
(One reader) wrote she turns off all her large appliances, including TV/VCR, 
at the breaker box, when not in use. These appliances do not use power when 
the switches are off, except maybe a clock. Most circuit breakers are not 
rated for switching purposes. They are for over-current protection only. Over 
time you will damage them with continual on/off switching.

Davis to order 1-hour notice of blackouts 
Plan also in works to give law enforcement even earlier alerts

N2963.DTL&type=news 
Sacramento -- Gov. Gray Davis will issue an executive order today requiring 
that Californians be given at least one hour's notice before blackouts hit, 
according to a top administration official. 
The one-hour notice is double what the California Independent System 
Operator, managers of the state's electrical grid, proposed earlier this 
week. The ISO board is scheduled to discuss its plan at a meeting today. 
Details of Davis' plan were still being worked out, said the administration 
official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. But any plan would have to 
order the ISO to give more notice of potential blackouts. 
Davis also hopes to give 48-hour and then 24-hour notices of probable 
blackout scenarios. Administration officials said the two-day notice would go 
to law enforcement, while everyone would get a 24-hour warning. 
Business groups welcomed the executive order. 
"We need to plan, we need to make adjustments in business schedules," said 
Jeanne Cain, vice president for government relations for the California 
Chamber of Commerce. "There are concerns about employee safety issues. The 
more notice we have, the better we can accommodate the blackout." 
Carl Guardino, an ISO board member and president of the Silicon Valley 
Manufacturing Group, has been pushing for an advanced notification plan and 
working with the governor. 
"Sixty minutes is twice as good" as 30 minutes, he said. 
With little doubt that blackouts will hit this summer, lawmakers have been 
searching for a way to make them easier on residents and businesses. 
"As much notice as possible would be helpful. It's helpful to have some 
advance notice for planning purposes, but small businesses will still be hurt 
by the blackouts," said Shirley Knight, assistant state director of the 
National Federation of Independent Business. 
"Most small businesses are in the service sector so they're open during the 
day, which means small-business owners aren't going to be able to recoup 
those blackout costs like a manufacturer might be able to," Knight said. 
But one consumer group said Davis should be doing more to stop the blackouts 
from happening in the first place. 
"It's like saying you're going to know a half hour earlier that an earthquake 
is coming," said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer 
Rights. "We should be stopping blackouts by standing up to the energy 
generators, rather than giving us an extra 30 minutes." 
'POWER WATCH' 
The Independent System Operator's proposed plan for forecasting potential 
blackouts envisions a system that would provide a 24-hour notice of high- 
demand days. A "Power Watch" would be declared whenever a Stage 1 or Stage 2 
alert is likely, while a "Power Warning" would be issued whenever there is at 
least a 50 percent chance of a Stage 3 alert, when electricity reserves drop 
below 1.5 percent. 
Until now, the agency has refused to give more than a few minutes' warning of 
blackouts, saying it did not want to alarm people when there was still a 
chance that a last-minute purchase of power could stave off blackouts. 
Pacific Gas and Electric Co. said it would welcome the advance notice to be 
able to notify customers who rely on electricity for life-critical equipment 
and large businesses. 
"We welcome advance notice from the ISO that would allow us to communicate to 
customers about pending rotating outages," said Ron Low, a spokesman for 
PG&E.
The public safety aspect must be taken into account, said one consumer group. 
"Blackouts have serious consequences, not just economic," said Mindy Spatt, 
spokeswoman for The Utility Reform Network in San Francisco. "They create 
public safety hazards, and all of those issues cannot be addressed from 
warnings. But knowing in advance is better." 
E-MAIL ALERTS
The ISO also has been working to upgrade its Web site to provide the most 
current information about how much electricity is being used and how much is 
available. It will also establish a system this summer through which that 
information can be sent in an hourly e-mail. 
This information may make it easier for larger users of electricity to plan 
their operations. 
Enlightening advice to prepare for blackouts Here's some advice from PG&E and 
local utilities about how to prepare for blackouts: 
-- Have a flashlight and radio with fresh batteries available. If you light 
candles, observe the usual safety precautions. 
-- If the lights go out, check with neighbors to determine if your home alone 
is affected. It may be a downed power line or some other problem, in which 
case you should alert PG&E or your city electrical bureau. 
-- Unplug or turn off all appliances, TVs and computers. Leave one light on 
to warn you when the power comes back on. 
-- When the power returns, turn one appliance on at a time to prevent power 
surges. 
-- Don't plug a generator into the wall; when the lights return, it can send 
a high-voltage current through the system that can electrocute power workers. 
-- Don't open your refrigerator, so your food will remain cold. 
-- Tell children who are home alone to remain calm, turn off the TV and 
computers and not to use candles.

Californians angry across the board in energy crisis 
Poll rates Bush worse than Davis

Californians are increasingly unhappy with the way Gov. Gray Davis has 
handled the state's power crunch, but he has plenty of company in their 
energy doghouse, a Field Poll shows. 
The state's power companies, out-of-state energy providers, President Bush 
and the Legislature all come out worse than Davis in the survey. 
"Davis' ratings have gone down, but a lot of others are given lower ratings" 
when people are asked to rank how the politicians and institutions are 
handling the state's energy situation, said Mark DiCamillo, director of the 
Field Poll. 
Growing worries about the seriousness of the power problem have sent ratings 
skidding for anyone connected with the energy business. 
"Everyone has gotten tarred," DiCamillo said. 
A solid 57 percent of those surveyed believe that Pacific Gas and Electric 
Co. and the state's other private electric utilities have done a poor or very 
poor job with the energy problem, with out-of-state power providers ranked 
almost as low. But 54 percent also put Bush's efforts in the poor/very poor 
category, and 52 percent consigned the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
to the same level. 
The growing disdain for the federal energy program probably can be linked 
with the president's refusal to back limits on energy prices, which are 
supported by a wide range of California residents, DiCamillo said. 
"To the extent that federal officials are seen as not bending on that issue, 
" he said, "I suspect that their ratings will continue to be rather dismal." 
The survey showed that Davis has had some success in his attempt to deflect 
the blame for California's energy woes from his office, but there are 
indications that that strategy may not work forever. 
Although 41 percent thought the governor was doing a good or very good job 
with the power crisis in January, that number fell to 27 percent in the new 
survey. The percentage of residents giving him poor or very poor marks jumped 
to 38 percent, up from 22 percent in January. 
The survey was conducted May 11 to May 20 of 1,015 California residents. It 
has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points. 
In the survey, Californians were quick to congratulate themselves on their 
own response to the energy problem. The poll showed that 39 percent believe 
residential energy consumers are doing a good or very good job responding to 
the problem, up from 26 percent in January. 
"People think they're making an effort to conserve," DiCamillo said. "In the 
public's eye, it's everyone else that is not doing what they should be 
doing." 
The survey also shows that the public has few illusions about the seriousness 
of the energy crunch. More than 80 percent believe it will be a year or more 
before the energy crisis is resolved, and more than half are convinced it 
will take at least two years to ensure a steady supply of electricity. 
"The gravity of the situation is such that the public is bracing itself for a 
long haul," DiCamillo said. "The state hasn't been able to fix the problem in 
a hurry, and people don't believe it's going to happen." 
The survey also showed that nearly half the state's residents believe that 
PG&E's bankruptcy will make it harder to continue to supply electricity to 
its customers while 59 percent say it would be a serious problem if 
businesses began to leave the state because of the possibility of blackouts. 
Concern about the continuing energy problem was strong across the state, 
DiCamillo said. 
"This is recognized as a major statewide issue," he said. "People think it 
will have an effect on them, regardless of where they live."

To encourage Oaklanders to take advantage of renewable energy, the city will 
waive fees and expedite plans for residents and business owners who want to 
install solar panels or other alternative energy generators. 
Previously, getting the necessary permits could take as long as eight weeks 
and cost more than $1,000. 
But under a measure proposed by Mayor Jerry Brown and approved Tuesday night 
by the Oakland City Council, the design review process will be waived if the 
equipment installation meets certain requirements, such as matching the pitch 
of a sloped roof. Permits will be free.

THE ENERGY CRUNCH 
New tips on power squeezing

U190766.DTL&type=news 
If you want to wrap yourself in the flag these days, there's no better way 
than by promoting energy conservation. 
Scientists from the Lawrence Livermore and Lawrence Berkeley national 
laboratories held a news conference yesterday to highlight new technologies 
and information sources to help consumers and businesses cut down on 
electricity use this summer. 
Flanked by tiny models of buildings with white roofs (up to 45 degrees cooler 
than dark ones), big charts showing U.S. energy flow and an array of "energy 
vampire" devices such as battery chargers that suck power whenever they're 
plugged in, earnest researchers discussed ways Californians can reduce their 
electricity use by 20 percent this summer. 
Meeting the goal has a big payoff, besides the obvious one of averting 
blackouts: Under the governor's 20/20 Rebate Plan, those who conserve 20 
percent this summer compared with the same months last year will not only 
shave that amount off their bills, but also get an equivalent rebate from the 
state -- essentially saving 40 percent. 
The technologies were a combination of new twists on humble objects and 
futuristic geeks-only inventions: 
-- WEB SITES. For folks who want to get a taste of the high-wire act lived 
every day by California grid operators, energycrisis.lbl.gov gives real-time 
data on the current supply and demand for electricity in the state. When you 
see the purple line (forecast load) start to hover near the red line 
(potential capacity), you know it's time to turn off the lights and hit the 
Save button. 
Lawrence Berkeley Lab is sponsoring three Web pages -- savepower.lbl.gov, 
HomeEnergySaver.lbl.gov and HomeImprovementTool.lbl.gov -- that offer 
customized conservation tips based on the user's climate and type of house -- 
saving 8 percent by using clotheslines instead of a dryer, for example. 
-- LAMPS. Lawrence Berkeley scientists have created the eponymous "Berkeley 
lamp," expected to go on sale in July for under $150. It's a high-performance 
table lamp with two fluorescent bulbs that together use less than 110 watts, 
but provide light equivalent to 300 or 400 watts. The lamp provides both 
"uplight," for illuminating an entire room, and "downlight," for close tasks 
such as reading. To be manufactured by Light Corp. of Minnesota, it will be 
sold through the company's Web site at www.lightcorp.com. 
Another, existing lamp -- a floor-standing torchere that uses compact 
fluorescent bulbs instead of halogen bulbs -- is widely available in hardware 
and lighting stores from a variety of manufacturers. 
-- WINDOWS. "Low-emissivity" windows look as transparent as regular glass but 
reflect infrared light, reducing heat transmission. The technology is now 
available in about 40 percent of windows sold. Consumers can recognize 
energy- efficient windows by a government "Energy Star" label; more 
information is available at www.efficientwindows.org. 
-- SCI-FI CHANNEL. At Lawrence Livermore Lab, scientists have been working on 
technology that's not for average users, but could eventually bring us up to 
date with the Jetsons. 
Technologies include electromechanical (flywheel) batteries, which can bridge 
the gap when the power goes off, thereby protecting sensitive electronic 
equipment. 
Then there are solid oxide fuel cells, which produce energy from fuel without 
using combustion -- a technology of the future, both for vehicles and 
stationary power. 
The Livermore researchers are also studying ways to make geothermal energy 
(which accounts for 6 percent of California's supply) more efficient and 
methods to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions from diesel generators. 
Further out, scientists hope to be able to store electricity, so energy from 
wind farms, for example, could be used at the times it's needed the most, 
instead of only when the weather cooperates.

House panel calls off vote on Calif power bill
WASHINGTON, (Reuters) - The U.S. Energy and Commerce Committee has called 
off, at least temporarily, a vote on legislation to aid California and other 
states during this summer's expected electricity shortage. 
Rep. Billy Tauzin, the Louisiana Republican chairman of the committee, said 
lawmakers needed more time to seek a bipartisan deal to get agreement on 
immediate help for power-starved California and the West. 
``We may be on the verge of a very solid bipartisan agreement,'' Tauzin said. 
He hoped that talks on Thursday would allow a vote on the pending legislation 
as early as today. 
The legislation was written by Republicans to reduce demand and encourage 
more supply of power in California this summer. Many Democrats on the 
committee objected to the bill, saying it needed a provision to cap wholesale 
prices in the entire Western region or else it fails to help the situation. 
Republican lawmakers, along with the Bush administration, strongly oppose 
price controls.






Davis proposal for more diesel power draws environmental criticism
LOS ANGELES (AP) -- California would get a little power and a lot of 
pollution from a proposal being considered by Gov. Gray Davis that would pay 
owners of backup generators to produce electricity. 
The proposal, one of several options the governor is considering, would pay 
for diesel power -- which at its dirtiest is 500 times more polluting than 
the cleanest natural gas power plants -- when electricity supplies are 
stretched. 
``If backup generators were to be used, it would only be as a last resort to 
avoid blackouts,'' said Davis spokesman Roger Salazar. ``Unfortunately, we 
are in an emergency situation. Everything is on the table.'' 
California's persistent power shortage has led to rolling blackouts around 
the state several times this year, with more anticipated when hot summer 
weather prompts people to use air conditioning. 
If all of the state's backup generators ran full time, they would produce 
about 425 tons of nitrogen dioxide per day. That's more than nine times the 
pollution power plants produced on an average day in 1999, according to state 
Air Resources Board data. 
And the state would get only about 550 megawatts of electricity -- barely 1 
percent of the state's peak power needs -- from the backup generators. That 
would be enough to power about 550,000 homes. 
``They could have a huge negative effect on air quality,'' said Ellen Garvey, 
executive officer for the Bay Area Air Quality Management Agency. ``It's one 
thing to run these generators during blackouts and emergency conditions, but 
using them for other purposes could be devastating.'' 
Business groups that support the proposal include the League of Food 
Processors, the California Manufacturers and Technology Association and San 
Diego Gas & Electric. 
``These generators could go a long way to taking some demand off the electric 
grid and putting some supply back into the power system,'' said Gino DiCaro, 
spokesman for the manufacturers and technology association. 
Most of the state's 17,200 backup generators are small units that run on 
diesel fuel and lack pollution controls. Some are rentals, and others can be 
found at hospitals, office buildings, sewage treatment plants and university 
labs. 
Unlike backup generators intended for home use, which are not regulated, 
industrial-sized units are limited in the number of hours they can operate. 
But since the state's power crunch began, regional air-quality regulators 
have issued emergency rules allowing them to run more frequently. 
Diesel engines produce carcinogenic soot and oxides of nitrogen -- a building 
block of asthma-inducing smog.











Small generators fight for payment from utilities 
Posted at 11:24 p.m. PDT Wednesday, May 23, 2001 
BY JENNIFER BJORHUS 

Mercury News 


BAKERSFIELD -- A gray cat picks its way through the lot of Oildale Energy, a 
small natural gas-fired power plant on the city's gritty northeast edge. The 
clamor of machinery and trucks -- sounds that meant prosperity here -- is 
gone. Employees have painted Oildale's machinery, insulated the boilers and 
tweaked the motionless 13-ton turbine. 
Now they wait. 
``It's kind of like a skeleton,'' says plant manager Mike Pankratz, surveying 
the octopus-tangle of pipes and tanks. 
Choked by the $10 million Pacific Gas & Electric Co. owes it, Oildale shut 
down Feb.?6, taking its 40 megawatts of badly needed electricity with it. The 
hush here is the sound of small generators locked in one of the most serious 
issues of California's energy crisis -- one that state regulators plan to 
wrestle with today. 
Oildale is part of a growing legion of small generators, from geothermal to 
gas-fired co-generation plants, battling California's utilities and state 
price controls they say are crippling them. These small generators, owed 
about $1.5 billion, supply up to a third of California's electricity. 
At least 25 have sued Southern California Edison over unpaid bills. Four have 
sued PG&E. And PG&E's bankruptcy proceedings in San Francisco are clogged 
with motions from at least 19 small generators, including Oildale. In many 
cases, these companies want to end their long-term supply contracts with the 
utilities so they can sell their electricity on the more lucrative open 
market. 
``What this is, basically, is the revolt of the mice,'' said Bill Short with 
Ridgewood Power Management, a New Jersey firm that has shuttered three 
gas-fired generators in California and sued PG&E. 
Officials to weigh debt 
The companies are hoping for action from the California Public Utilities 
Commission, which is scheduled today to weigh whether to order the utilities 
to pay the back debt. Meanwhile, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali wades 
through motions filed by disgruntled generators and counter motions from 
PG&E. 
The deteriorating finances of some of the approximately 690 small generators 
threatens California's fragile power supply just as the state heads into the 
summer months up to 3,700 megawatts short. 
The deep and often unexpected economic impacts of California's energy crunch 
add up daily. In Oildale's case, the shutdown not only jeopardizes the jobs 
of its 10 anxious employees, but those of more than 150 employees at the 
refinery next door. 
It's one of the biggest public policy botches in the energy crisis, some 
energy experts argue. California is shooting itself in the foot by not 
attending to the relatively clean and efficient small power suppliers in its 
own back yard, they say. Gas-fired co-generation plants, which provide power 
to nearby businesses and sell electricity to utilities, are some of the most 
efficient producers in the state. And many of the small generators harness 
renewable resources like the sun and garbage fumes, lessening the state's 
dependence on high-priced natural gas. 
``The idea that we're refusing to step in and help them while we're paying 
through the nose to pay Dynegy and Williams and everybody else, this is just 
nuts,'' said Severin Borenstein, director of the University of California 
Energy Institute, mentioning companies that own major power plants in the 
state. ``This is really a major blunder.'' 
The immediate crisis started in late January, Oildale's Pankratz explained. 
That's when PG&E told the plant it was not going to pay for electricity 
delivered in December. The news worried Oildale's gas supplier, Pankratz 
said, which halted the plant's supply. 
Pankratz turned off the plant's turbine. 
The move socked Golden Bear Oil Specialties, the refinery that looms over 
Oildale. Unable to operate without the cheap steam heat Oildale supplies, 
Golden Bear cannot heat the asphalt and industrial oils it produces. Golden 
Bear filed for bankruptcy April 23. Last week it announced plans to lay off 
172 employees. 
Golden Bear Chairman Carl Soderlind said Oildale, Golden Bear's exclusive 
source of steam heat for nearly 20 years, was a key reason his group bought 
the refinery four years ago. Having it go under was ``gut-wrenching,'' he 
said. 
Power unavailable 
The California Independent System Operator, keeper of the state's electricity 
grid, reports that 1,400 megawatts of power from small generators are off 
line. It estimates that about half of that -- 700 megawatts, or energy for as 
many as 700,000 homes -- is due to the financial squeeze of natural gas 
prices, money owed by the utilities or both. Others say financial problems 
have 1,100 megawatts off line. 
Lawmakers haven't been much help. The state Assembly on March?22 rejected a 
hastily crafted rescue bill meant to help buttress these companies. The issue 
has languished in Sacramento. 
Days later, the utilities commission ordered California's utilities to pay 
the generators for electricity delivered in the future -- which saved many of 
them -- but it did not order the utilities to pay the hefty back-due amounts. 
It also set a new rate for what utilities should pay the generators for 
electricity. That price is 22 percent lower and too low for business, some 
argue. 
The commission's position has been that the small generators should abide by 
their existing contracts, said commission attorney Gary Cohen: ``To the 
extent that some of them are facing financial hardship, the commission may 
take a look at whether it can do anything to help them vis-a-vis the back 
debt.'' 
The lack of stronger action to support these generators baffles some critics. 
``It's like talking to a starving man on a desert island and saying, `How 
long can you hold up until the ship comes?'?'' said V. John White, director 
of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies. 
Some of the companies have appealed to the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission, but regulators are waiting to see if the state and the courts can 
resolve the issue. 
``We're in what essentially amounts to an abusive relationship,'' said Short 
with Ridgewood, the independent generator that has sued PG&E. 
Two courts have allowed generators fighting Edison to suspend their 
contracts. Five have lost their fights. Another five have won the right to 
put a lien on Edison's assets. 
In PG&E's battle, three of the four lawsuits are on hold because of the 
bankruptcy. In the fourth, a judge allowed a generator out of the contract it 
had terminated before the bankruptcy. 
As for Oildale, it wants PG&E to pay the $10.5 million it owes or Oildale 
wants to sell its electricity on the open market. It also wants PG&E to pay 
what it calls ``a fair market value'' for its electricity. 
If Oildale can't sell on the open market soon, it will be forced into 
bankruptcy, its attorneys argue. Pankratz estimates his plant can hang in 
limbo only three more months. 
PG&E is fighting to keep its small generators, which it says are exaggerating 
their damage. It reports that only a tiny fraction of its 300 generators are 
off line. 
Increased costs 
If the plants were released from their contracts, PG&E could not afford to 
pay the extra $284 million per month it estimates electricity would cost. The 
state Department of Water Resources -- and ultimately ratepayers -- would 
have to foot that bill. 
A fast solution isn't likely from the bankruptcy court. The judge has made it 
clear the generators raise a host of complicated legal questions. 
Meanwhile, the clock ticks. 
``We've all been a little tense,'' says Judy Andreatta, who has worked 
Oildale's front desk for 10 years and worries about her job. ``It's just so 
scary watching everything happen. Who'd ever think we'd lose power?''













Electricity notebook 
FERC may renew price caps 
May 24, 2001 
From Register wire services 
Federal regulators this week announced that they might reimpose caps on the 
cost of transporting natural gas into southern California. 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Tuesday gave the public 20 days 
to comment on the possibility of reinstating caps, which were temporarily 
suspended by the commission this year. The price controls were lifted in an 
effort to expand the reach of deregulation. 
This proposed action, said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., "could make a 
real difference." 
"Since FERC engaged in this experimental lifting of the cap, the price of 
natural gas in Southern California has climbed to three times higher than the 
rest of the nation,'' said Feinstein. Currently, she said, the price in 
Southern California is $12.59 per million British Thermal Units and only 
$3.70 in the rest of the Western region. Gas fuels most 
electricity-generating plants in the state. 
The commission also asked for comment on whether the caps should be limited 
to California or include other Western markets. 













Legislators search for a Plan B for Edison 
Davis' tack is politically volatile. The aim still is to steer clear of 
bankruptcy. 
May 24, 2001 
By HANH KIM QUACH 
and KATE BERRY
The Orange County Register 
SACRAMENTO Lawmakers this week will seek to swap the deal Gov. Gray Davis 
made to rescue the state's No. 2 utility from financial ruin with something 
more politically palatable. 
Davis' deal, some have complained, is sweeter for Southern California Edison 
than for taxpayers. So at least four proposals are being floated to supplant 
that plan. But legislators are far from a consensus on any of them. Plans 
emerge, recede and are reconfigured daily. 
Energy experts and bankruptcy lawyers warn that too much legislative fiddling 
could result in what neither side wants: bankruptcy for Edison. 
Bankruptcy means the state would be stuck buying energy until both Edison and 
Pacific Gas & Electric - which is already in bankruptcy - complete the 
Chapter 11 process, which could take years, experts and lawmakers said. 
The state's wallet would shrink, affecting its ability to build schools and 
roads. Ratepayers might be on the hook for an additional $1 billion for the 
company's legal fees, because bankruptcy would freeze its assets, said Brian 
Bennett, vice president of Edison International, the utility's parent 
company. 
Southern California Edison has said it's willing to be flexible on the 
governor's plan, which calls for the state to buy Edison's transmission grid 
for $2.76 billion. Company officials wouldn't comment on the various 
alternatives. 
"We understand that the transmission deal is the subject of controversy and 
are open to variations on it,'' Bennett said. 
Steve Maviglio, Davis' spokesman, said the governor also remained committed 
to his deal. 
"Edison is going to survive,'' said Mitch Wilk, a member of the state Public 
Utilities Commission from 1986 through 1991 and a past president of the 
agency. But the question is "whether it will survive via the (plan) that the 
governor negotiated or they do the same kind of thing PG&E did." 
"There is still a very real risk that SCE will be forced into bankruptcy if 
the Legislature tinkers too much with the deal, or fails to move ahead 
promptly,'' Wilk said. 
PG&E chose to file Chapter 11 last month because it was dissatisfied with the 
progress of negotiations with Davis on a state rescue of the company. PG&E's 
move was an embarrassment for Davis, who had vowed to keep the state's big 
utilities solvent. 
"One of the principal chips Edison has with the state is not filing for 
bankruptcy,'' said Ed Feo, a lawyer involved with the PG&E case. "It would be 
a black eye for the state. As long as the company stays out of bankruptcy, 
they have something to trade." 
Edison's creditors are still waiting to see how the utility fares with the 
Legislature. Some have agreed to defer receiving payments until the end of 
June. 
Dean Vanech, president of New Jersey-based Carson Cogeneration, said a lot of 
things need to happen before he and other creditors feel ready to drag Edison 
into bankruptcy. 
"In general, we would have to feel like there was absolutely no hope in a 
deal being made,'' Vanech said. But, he admitted, "there's a concern that a 
resolution will not be put on the table in any reasonable period of 
time.''Meanwhile, Edison has vigorously lobbied the Legislature to approve 
the transmission deal. The company has launched a public-relations campaign 
to persuade the public that it is in its interest, said John Bryson, chief 
executive of Edison International. 
"Bankruptcy is a last resort,'' Bryson said in a recent interview. "We 
believe there will be a solution.'' 
But changes are necessary, said Senate Leader John Burton, D-San Francisco, 
"because people didn't like Plan A.'' 
Lawmakers cringed at some elements of the plan, which many thought was overly 
generous to Edison: limiting investigation of the utility's parent's company 
and guaranteeing the company an 11.6 percent annual return on investment. 
Alternatives include: requiring power generators to accept up to one-third 
less than the collective $3.5 billion they're owed; taxing Edison on its 
property and using the tax to pay off its debts; and allowing Edison to build 
more power plants. The latest proposal would require the state to sell bonds 
to pay off Edison's debts and give the state the option to buy the 
transmission lines later. Most of the proposals would require an extra 
surcharge on ratepayers bills to pay off debts. 
One hurdle the legislature faces: rallying two-thirds of each house behind 
one plan, necessary any time the state spends money. Republicans have been 
philosophically opposed to acquiring transmission lines, and half the 
alternatives include that element. 
But Stanford University professor James Sweeney thinks compromise is 
possible. Lawmakers and the utility will strike a deal simply because a 
second bankruptcy would tarnish the image of the state's political leaders. 
Sweeney believes, however, the outcome might be more fair in court. 
"Bankruptcies are messy ... but so is the political process,'' Sweeney said. 
"We're in a situation where the leadership (politically) seems not willing to 
bite the bullet. It may be better for our state to have a bankruptcy judge 
who is very strong and who isn't planning for a higher office.'' 














Long Beach obtains lien on Edison's assets 
The city is the fourth small supplier with an attachment on the utility. 
May 24, 2001 
By KATE BERRY
The Orange County Register 
The city of Long Beach became the fourth small power supplier to get a lien 
against the assets of Southern California Edison, a move that could push the 
utility closer to bankruptcy. 
Last week, Edison was ordered to freeze at least $9 million in bank accounts 
to cover payments owed to Long Beach for power Edison bought from the city's 
trash-to-energy plant. 
Getting a lien on the utility's assets ensures the city will be paid, even if 
the utility files for bankruptcy. 
Stephen Pickett, Edison International's general counsel, said the utility 
plans to appeal. 
Long Beach also is suing Edison International, the utility's parent company, 
for breach of contract, claiming the utility should not have transferred $4.7 
billion to its parent company over a four-year period beginning in 1996, when 
deregulation was implemented. 
"Edison International was required to honor the debts of its subsidiary,'' 
said Robert Shannon, Long Beach's city attorney. 
So far, Edison has been sued by 27 small power suppliers, known as qualifying 
facilities, or QFs. The lawsuits either seek to put a lien on the utility's 
assets to recover unpaid debts or attempt to terminate 20-year contracts to 
provide power to Edison. 
Edison owes QFs about $1 billion and is trying to combine the cases before a 
single judge in Los Angeles. 
But Long Beach differs from other power suppliers because it wants to stay in 
its contract with Edison. 
"We just want to be paid under our contract. We still want to deliver them 
power,'' said Shannon. 
As a municipality, Long Beach also did not have to post a bond to obtain a 
lien as the other QFs must. 
Ed Feo, a lawyer for wind, solar and biomass QFs, said liens on Edison's 
assets could have a domino effect. 
"Two things will accelerate a bankruptcy filing by Edison: Either the deal to 
sell its transmission lines (to the state) is going nowhere and alternatives 
are not acceptable - or if attachments are made to the company's property 
that the utility doesn't want to run the risk of losing.'' 
Three other QFs have posted bonds to obtain liens against Edison. They 
include Caithness Energy, which got a lien on Edison's 56 percent interest in 
two qualifying facilities that make up the Mohave Generating Station in 
Laughlin, Nev.; IMC Chemicals, a unit of IMC Global Inc. of Northbrook, Ill., 
and that won a $7 million lien; and Herber Geothermal Co. and Second Imperial 
Geothermal Co., which is owned by Covanta Energy Corp., a former unit of 
Ogden Corp., based in Fairfield, N.J. 













Poll: 59% in state favor nuclear power 
It's a reversal of views since the Three Mile Island accident. 
May 24, 2001 

The Associated Press 
Fifty-nine percent of Californians now support building more nuclear plants, 
according to a poll released Wednesday. 
The last time the Field Institute polled Californians about nuclear energy 
was 1984 - five years after the accident at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania 
- and it found 61 percent opposed to nuclear power. 
"In my interpretation, the current energy crisis has some bearing on the 
public's changed attitudes on nuclear power," said Mark DiCamillo, spokesman 
for the nonpartisan polling organization. 
"The public is searching for clean ways to add to the capacity." 
The Field poll comes as the Bush administration pushes for a renewed look at 
nuclear power. No utilities have ordered any new nuclear power plants in the 
United States since 1978. 
The poll of 1,015 California adults was taken May 11-20. The margin of error 
was plus or minus 3.2 percent. 
Carl Zichella, the Sierra Club's regional staff director, said Californians 
have not thought about nuclear energy for about 20 years and do not have as 
much information as they did around Three Mile Island. 
"I think this number really reflects a lack of knowledge on the part of the 
public about the problems that drove nuclear power underground," he said. 
"The more people know about nuclear power, the less they're going to like 
it." 
Getting a new nuclear plant built faces two major problems: financing and 
siting, said Rich Ferguson, research director for the Sacramento- based 
Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technology. 
"We have just not seen any interest in the financial community to invest the 
billions of dollars," he said. 






Filing for Hayward Project Includes Request for Expedited Review


PLEASANTON, Calif., May 23 /PRNewswire/ -- San Jose-based, Calpine
Corporation (NYSE: CPN) and San Francisco-based, Bechtel Enterprises Holdings,
Inc. today filed an Application For Certification (AFC) with the California
Energy Commission (CEC) for its proposed Russell City Energy Center in
Hayward, Calif.  The filing marks the beginning of an extensive CEC licensing
process required to build and operate an electricity generating facility in
California.  The filing included a request for expedited review that would
reduce the licensing review process period from 12 months to 6 months.


The proposed Russell City Energy Center would be a 600-megawatt, natural
gas-fired, combined-cycle electric generating facility located on
approximately 14 acres of land, zoned heavy industrial, at 3636 Enterprise
Avenue in Hayward.  The site is adjacent to the city of Hayward's wastewater
treatment plant, which would supply recycled water to the Energy Center. The
Russell City Energy Center would provide needed electricity for Hayward,
western Alameda County and the San Francisco Peninsula.


The modern technology used at the facility would allow for a greater than
90 percent reduction of certain emissions and is 40 percent more
fuel-efficient compared to older gas-fueled facilities in the Bay Area.


"The Russell City Energy Center will provide a vital new source of clean,
reliable electricity in the region," said Curt Hildebrand, vice president and
general manager of the Calpine/Bechtel Joint Development.  "We look forward to
working with the City of Hayward, Alameda County and the California Energy
Commission to develop a model Energy Center."


Submittal of the AFC represents the culmination of more than six months of
extensive engineering, technical and environmental studies.


"We are hopeful that the considerable groundwork that we have laid thus
far will make this project eligible for the six month CEC review process,"
Hildebrand added.  "We are seeking the expedited review to do everything we
can to help solve the state's energy crisis as quickly as possible."


Once the CEC determines that the application is complete, and determine
whether the project qualifies for the expedited review process, the official
review will begin.  As lead agency, the CEC will work with environmental and
government agencies in conducting its review and will hold local workshops and
hearings to encourage community participation. The expedited review process
would require the same environmental and technical standards as the longer
review period.  Based upon the successful licensing of the project,
construction could begin in summer of 2002, with commercial operation by
summer of 2004.


Copies of the AFC filings will be available through the CEC and at local
libraries. Summaries of the study will be posted on the Russell City Energy
Center website (www.russellcityenergycenter.com).  To receive additional
information on the CEC process, visit their website at www.energy.ca.gov.  For
more information on the Russell City Energy Center, call 510-704-8475.

California Governor Signs Bill to Speed Up Approval for Power Plants



LOS ANGELES, May 22, 2001 (Xinhua via COMTEX) -- Governor of California Gray
Davis on Tuesday signed a bill to speed up the process of approving 
construction
of new power plants as a way to fight the ongoing power shortage.

"California is in a war with energy producers, and the best long-term weapon 
is
to build more power plants," Davis said at a signing ceremony in Elk Grove,
California.


The bill will shorten the application process for a new or remodeled power
plant, as well as the time that local governments have to review proposals.


Davis said the new bill will speed up two energy projects that are in the
process right now, including a 900-megawatt plant in Palm Springs and a gas
storage project in Lodi that will store up to 12 billion cubic feet of natural
gas.


California has been suffering from a power crisis since last year, which has
caused repeated blackouts and sent the power rate spiraling.


The crisis is largely blamed on the 1996 deregulation law that forces the
utilities to buy electricity from the wholesale market at higher rates than 
they
charge the customers. And the repairs of generators in some power plants and 
the
warming weather have made things worse.


After the heavily indebted utilities could no longer afford to buying power
anymore, the state government has used more than 7 billion dollars of tax 
money
so far this year to buy electricity on behalf of them.


Among other measures to ease the power shortage, the state government has 
called
for residents to conserve electricity as much as they can, especially during 
the
peak-hours during the day.Residents have been told to brace for a worse
situation during the incoming summer.

Lockyer: Probe may spark suit 
Criminal charges could follow evidence of price gouging 
By Steve Geissinger
SACRAMENTO BUREAU 
SACRAMENTO -- State Attorney General Bill Lockyer said Wednesday his 
investigation of alleged multibillion-dollar price gouging by power 
generators has laid the foundation for a successful civil case that could win 
huge refunds. 
"But the whole house hasn't been built," Lockyer said in an interview with 
ANG Newspapers. 
The attorney general said the probe he expects to complete in the next eight 
weeks also may yet yield criminal charges, which could result in power 
company officials being locked up "with my tattooed dude." 
Lockyer, a former East Bay legislator, rattled electricity suppliers earlier 
this week when he told the Wall Street Journal: "I would love to personally 
escort (Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth) Lay to an 8 x 10 cell that he could 
share with a tattooed dude who says, 'Hi, my name is Spike, honey.'" 
Houston-based Enron, like other energy-trading firms, has denied wrongdoing 
in the California market. It dismissed Lockyer's comment as not warranting a 
response butquietlyprotested to the Davis administration. Other power 
companies have expressed outrage. 
"I was trying to convey a message to ... the out-of-state energy generators," 
Lockyer said. "I decided to make the point with the energy generators that 
they've got a serious fight on their hands." 
The attorney general, however, conceded he has "felt guilty about it ever 
since because I'm a prosecutor and I take pride in being careful about these 
sorts of accusations or claims." 
"But I know it won't be in print unless I find some sort of colorful way to 
... pump up the rhetoric," he said. 
"We don't care if they're multi-millionaires. We don't care if they run big 
corporations. They're buccaneers. They're ripping us off. 
"Now, while we're still in the legal analysis of whether it's legal or 
illegal greed, it's clearly immoral. There's no debate about that." 
Lockyer said his investigators are scrutinizing tens of thousands of 
transactions and hundreds of thousands of documents to determine the strength 
of the state's case. 
"I think there is strong evidence that lays the foundation for a successful 
civil action, but the whole house hasn't been built," Lockyer said. 
A civil case could result in refunds that "disgorge the obscene profits," he 
said. 
The California Independent System Operator, which manages the state's 
electric transmission grid, estimates that power suppliers may have 
overcharged California by $6.8 billion since early last year. 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has so far tentatively ordered 
California suppliers to make only tens of millions of dollars in refunds as 
part of that agency's ongoing probe. 
Lockyer said criminal charges will be filed if investigators find that 
company officials intentionally engaged in unfair business practices. 
The attorney general said he hopes to complete the work within the next eight 
weeks despite what he called stalling tactics such as those by three energy 
firms -- Reliant and Dynegy of Houston and Mirant of Atlanta. 
The three companies agreed Tuesday to surrender copies of internal documents 
that had been subpoenaed two months ago by Lockyer as part of the probe. 
"They've been throwing $500-an-hour lawyers at us in high volume to drag 
their feet and stall our investigation," Lockyer said. 
The attorney general's comments come amid a flurry of lawsuits and 
allegations by California officials against power suppliers, as well as 
ongoing probes. 
Besides the attorney and FERC, the Legislature, state Public Utilities 
Commission, Cal-ISO and the California Electricity Oversight Board are all 
conducting investigations.

Blackouts Not Expected 
Today

Bay City News 

Following two consecutive days of rolling blackouts, California's power 
picture looks much brighter today, but conservation is still needed. 
The California Independent System Operator is urging consumers to continue 
conservation measures during today's Stage One Electrical Emergency. 
"The conservation efforts of Californians, particularly Tuesday evening, were 
significant and helped to reduce the duration and impact of yesterday's 
blackouts,'' according to officials. "The California ISO asks customers to 
continue their voluntary reductions during this time of tight supply." 
More than 11,500 megawatts of in-state generation remain unavailable with 
power plants completing repairs and needed maintenance. However, several 
generating units returned to service today and the level of imported power 
has increased, boosting the supply. 
"The ISO is cautiously optimistic that customer outages will be avoided 
today,'' according to officials. 
Today's Stage One alert is in effect through midnight tonight. 
Stage One Emergencies are declared when power reserves fall below 7 percent. 
Stage Two kicks in when reserves fall below 5 percent. Stage Three is 
initiated when reserves drop to below 1.5 percent.

Calif State Controller:General Fund Surplus Dn To $3.2B


03/21/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- California State Controller Kathleen Connell 
Wednesday said the state's general fund surplus has dropped to $3.2 billion 
from $8.5 billion in January, mostly because of electricity purchases made by 
the state's Department of Water Resources, a press release said. 
Connell also denied Gov. Gray Davis' request to transfer an additional $5.6 
billion from the general fund to the Special Fund for Economic Uncertainties, 
the release said.
Connell noted that, given the rapid depletion of the general fund on power 
purchases, the state would need to borrow $2.4 billion in order to tranfer 
the $5.6 billion from the general fund to the special fund. 
"We started this year with a generous budget surplus. The energy crisis has 
taken much of that away, and this transfer on top of the electricity 
purchases would put the fund at risk," Connell said. 

Connell called on Davis to ensure that the CDWR completes by the end of May 
2001 the revenue bond sales that will be used to buy power and repay the 
general fund. 
She also asked that the CDWR notify her of all power purchases made and 
contracts negotiated thus far and requested that she be told within 7 days of 
any purchases and contracts negotiated in the future. 
Connell also said she wanted to be told within 24 hours of any power buys 
that exceed $55 million and asked that the Department of Finance be directed 
to prepare new general fund cash flow estimates for the next 30 and 60 days, 
and for the end of the fiscal year. 
The state's Department of Water Resources has been buying power since January 
in lieu of Edison International (EIX) utility Southern California Edison and 
PG&E Corp (PCG) utility Pacific Gas and Electric Co, because suppliers 
refused to sell to the nearly-bankrupt utilities.

jessicaberthold@dowjones.com 

Gov. Davis' office said, in response to Connell's comments, that the state 
budget was solid and the economy remained strong. 
"We will be getting the money back we've paid for energy and it should have 
no significant effect on the state's finances from the Wall Street 
perspective," said Davis press secretary Steve Maviglio.

Davis says regulators will act to pay QFs
Electricity providers insist they need to be paid
By Russ Britt, CBS.MarketWatch.com 
Last Update: 9:45 PM ET Mar 20, 2001
LOS ANGELES (CBS.MW) - California Gov. Gray Davis said regulators will act 
Tuesday on a plan to guarantee that independent power generators are paid.
Independent power producers provide about 30 percent of California's 
electricity from a variety of sources including wind, solar and other 
sources. Because many of the companies, known as Qualifying Facilities, or 
QFs, haven't been paid they've begun to withhold power, contributing to 
blackouts in the state Monday and Tuesday. 
"We are anxious to pay the QFs because they're falling like flies," Davis 
said at a news conference late Tuesday. "If they don't get paid, the lights 
will go out."
Davis said the state's PUC order will require the state's nearly bankrupt 
utilities to enter five-year contracts with the QFs at rates of 7.9 cents per 
kilowatt hour, or 10-year contracts for lower rates. The structure is similar 
to rates Davis claims he was able to negotiate for long-term power contracts 
from out-of-state generators.

Rash power bill may need fix
By Will Shuck
From our Sacramento Bureau
SACRAMENTO Even as lawmakers lament the slow pace of solving California's 
energy crisis, the cost of haste has cropped up in their first major act, a 
multibillion dollar measure that put the state in the power-buying business. 

AB1X, the highly touted bill that put California in the power-buying 
business, may have been so rashly crafted that it will take another piece of 
legislation to fix it, an influential senator said Tuesday. 
At issue is vague wording that makes it unclear when and to what extent 
Southern California Edison and other utilities have to repay the state for 
buying power. 
State Sen. Debra Bowen, chairwoman of the Senate Energy, Utilities and 
Communications Committee, said the bill apparently has left room for utility 
lawyers to argue that their companies needn't repay the state until they have 
covered other costs. 
But Bowen, a Redondo Beach Democrat who represents downtown and western Long 
Beach, said "the legislative intent is crystal clear" that the state wanted 
to be repaid directly for supplying about a third of the power utility 
companies deliver to their customers. 
"We need a cleanup bill" to set the matter straight, she said. 
Although AB1X illustrates the flaws that come with speed, Bowen said, the 
Legislature can't afford to delay. 
"I think we are much too slow in our response," she said. "But that has to be 
balanced against things we've done in a tearing hurry and then have had to 
fix later." 
No matter what the Legislature does in the coming weeks, she said, California 
is in for a tough summer, and only determined conservation efforts will put 
much of a dent in a precarious supply-demand equation.

PUC considers rewarding producers that sign long-term contracts 
Greg Lucas, Lynda Gledhill, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau
Wednesday, March 21, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle 
Sacramento -- Some cash-strapped producers of wind, solar and other 
alternative forms of energy will get long-delayed financial relief under a 
proposed order by state regulators, Gov. Gray Davis said yesterday evening. 
A proposed order by the Public Utilities Commission is designed to reward 
energy producers who sign long-term contracts with utilities at lower rates. 
Alternative energy producers that voluntarily enter such contracts, which 
would start on April 1, would be paid within 15 days, said Davis, who 
requested the order. Those that do not would have to wait until the utilities 
that buy their power return to solvency. 
Davis blasted Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison for 
not paying the alternative generators -- know as qualified facilities, or 
"QFs" -- even though the companies have been collecting money through rates. 
"It is wrong and irresponsible of the utilities to pocket and withhold the 
money designed to compensate the QFs," Davis said. "It's immoral and has to 
stop." 
Alternative producers -- ranging from massive co-generation facilities at oil 
refineries to tiny biomass plants -- produce about a third of the state's 
supply of electricity. But many are shutting down because utilities have not 
paid them since November. 
The loss of some 3,000 megawatts from tapped-out alternative energy producers 
contributed to the blackouts that snarled California yesterday and Monday, 
according to the Independent System Operator, which manages the state's power 
grid. 
The PUC's proposed order -- which will be considered at the board's Tuesday 
meeting -- offers the generators a choice of agreeing to a five-year contract 
at $79 per megawatt or a 10-year deal at $69 per megawatt, Davis said. 
The order does not address the more than $1 billion already owed to the more 
than 600 alternative energy producers around the state. Davis said to favor 
one creditor over another in past debt could bring on bankruptcy proceedings 
from other creditors. 
The Legislature would also need to act to make the order work. 
"It is critical to keep these facilities up and online," said Sen. Debra 
Bowen, D-Marina del Ray, who estimates that Edison has $1.5 billion in cash 
on hand, and PG&E $2.5 billion. "The utilities owe it to the people of the 
state to pay them." 
Edison said yesterday that it opposed any attempt to place alternative 
producers ahead of their other creditors. 
But Tom Higgins, a senior vice president for Edison International, which owes 
alternative producers some $835 million, said his company was talking to the 
governor's office about possible payment structures. 
Alternative energy producers, particularly those that use high-priced natural 
gas to fire their generators, say that without an immediate infusion of cash 
they must close their plants. 
"We've been obsessed with the health of the utilities and (have) forgotten 
the health of everyone else," said V. John White, legislative director of the 
Clean Power Campaign, which lobbies for alternative energy producers. 
CalEnergy Operating Corp., which operates eight geothermal plants in the 
Imperial Valley producing 268 megawatt hours for Edison has sued the utility 
asking to be paid and to be temporarily released from their contract with 
Edison which has paid them nothing since November. 
CalEnergy has a court hearing tomorrow on its Edison contract. Edison owes 
the company $75 million, and the debt increases by $1 million a day. 
"We've lived up to our end of the bargain but Edison hasn't. We're now not in 
a position to make a property tax payment on April 10 and we're the largest 
employer in the county," said Vince Signorotti, CalEnergy's property manager. 
Unlike Edison, PG&E is paying its creditors 15 cents on the dollar. 
"We have offered over the past five days to prepay for future power not yet 
delivered to keep as many of them operating as possible, but the state needs 
to decide how its going to divvy up the limited money under the frozen 
rates," said John Nelson, a PG&E spokesman. 
The PUC's sudden attempt to recast the rates paid to alternative generators 
comes after several months of inaction, partly a result of waiting for 
legislative negotiations on the issue to conclude. Those negotiations 
eventually failed to move forward.

State claims $5.5 billion overcharge: Refunds by wholesale generators sought
By Dale Kasler
Bee Staff Writer
(Published March 22, 2001) 
In its boldest attempt yet to extract refunds from wholesale power 
generators, the state's grid operator accused the generators Wednesday of 
overcharging Californians by $5.5 billion for electricity since last May. 
The state's Independent System Operator, which manages the state's 
transmission grid, plans to tell a federal regulatory agency today that power 
generators consistently took advantage of their stranglehold on the 
California market to ratchet up prices. 
The federal agency, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, recently 
threatened to order generators to refund $134.8 million for overcharges, 
mostly covering January and February. But those refunds amounted to just a 
fraction of what the grid operator was seeking. The ISO, which has been 
complaining about market abuses for several months, says FERC must do more. 
"We're happy that (FERC) took this first step, but we think there's a long 
way to go," said Anjali Sheffrin, the ISO's director of market analysis. "As 
far as I'm concerned, it's been too little, too late. ... The refunds they 
have acted on (so far) have been minimal." 
She said the report covers five major power suppliers and 16 other power 
importers. 
FERC Commissioner William L. Massey said it would be improper for him to 
comment on a report that has not yet been filed. But when told of the $5.5 
billion total, Massey told the Los Angeles Times: "That doesn't shock me in 
any way." 
"Prices over the past 10 months in California have greatly exceeded the 
federal standards of just and reasonable prices, and I think they have 
exceeded the standards by possibly billions of dollars," he said. 
However, most FERC critics are skeptical that the federal agency, which is a 
strong believer in letting free markets run their course, would order a 
refund anywhere near as large as $5.5 billion -- even though it has found 
that California prices at times have been "unjust and unreasonable." 
The big power generators, saying their charges were reasonable, are disputing 
the $134.8 million refunds proposed so far and have vowed to fight the ISO's 
latest effort. 
If the ISO were to prevail, the $5.5 billion in refunds could go a long way 
toward remedying California's energy mess. 
They could help restore the financial health of Pacific Gas and Electric Co. 
and Southern California Edison, which have nearly been bankrupted by the 
prices charged by the power generators. They also could ease the strain on 
the state treasury, which is spending billions to purchase electricity for 
Californians because PG&E and Edison can't. 
Sheffrin said her department studied sales made by the power generators to 
ISO, which makes last-minute power purchases to balance supply with demand, 
and the California Power Exchange, the now-bankrupt entity where most of 
California's wholesale electricity was bought and sold until December. 
She said the study made "very generous" allowances for natural gas expenses, 
costly air-pollution credits and other factors, including the scarcity of 
electricity. The result was $5.5 billion worth of charges "in excess of 
competitive costs," she said. 
In many cases, the companies used their market clout to submit bids that were 
"way beyond their costs," she said. 
"It was insufficient competition," Sheffrin said. "They got away with a lot." 
She said the refund request isn't just a shot in the dark. FERC, she noted, 
"has already found that prices in the California wholesale energy market have 
been unreasonable. We took it upon ourselves ... to show FERC how they got to 
be so high." 
FERC proposed refunds totaling $124 million for January and February sales, 
declaring that generators' prices were too high. 
In a separate case the federal agency, for the first time, accused two 
generators last week of taking plants offline to force prices up.

Power solution eludes Davis: Lawmakers grow edgy as crisis drags on 
By Emily Bazar and Amy Chance
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published March 22, 2001) 
Gov. Gray Davis likes to compare the state's energy crisis to a complicated 
"three-cornered" billiard shot. 
But as California plunged into another round of power blackouts this week, 
Davis has yet to line up the angle on an ultimate solution. 
The state's short-term power bill is nearing $4.2 billion, and legislators 
are balking at the administration's requests for additional money. 
Getting even the least controversial pieces of the puzzle through the 
Legislature is taking weeks longer than expected. 
While the Democratic governor has insisted secrecy about details of his power 
purchases is necessary to protect the state's bargaining position, other 
state officials are complaining vigorously about the lack of information. 
And critical deals the governor hoped to reach with energy suppliers and 
utility companies are proving difficult to close. 
"I think we all got lulled into a little complacency a few weeks ago. All 
these things seemed to be going along, and the governor was making all these 
warm and fuzzy comments," said Assemblyman John Campbell, R-Irvine. 
"But it only takes one deal to go sideways and we're all blacked out," he 
added. "The governor is running around basically saying, 'Trust me.' I'm not 
sure he's deserving of the trust at this point." 
Davis and his aides insist they are working around the clock on plans to 
boost power generation, encourage conservation and reach an agreement with 
utilities that will keep them out of bankruptcy. 
The utility plan, they say, is the equivalent of a large corporate merger 
that simply can't be accomplished overnight. Davis notes that earlier 
deregulation efforts might have benefitted from a little more time. 
Although the state has reached a broad "agreement in principle" with Southern 
California Edison to obtain its power transmission lines in exchange for help 
paying off its debts, a final, detailed deal has not been reached. The 
initial agreement with Edison was announced Feb. 23. 
And the governor has yet to achieve a tentative agreement with Pacific Gas 
and Electric Co., which is driving a harder bargain over price and other 
elements of a potential rescue plan. 
Joseph Fichera, one of several consultants receiving more than $11 million 
from the administration for advice on the energy crisis, said many people 
don't realize the complexity of the deal they're brokering. 
In their bid to achieve a public takeover of the investor-owned utilities' 
transmission lines, he said, negotiators have to pore over thousands of 
documents related to the transmission lines alone. 
"We are doing what is normal in a transaction of this magnitude, which is 
investigate, document, circulate, redocument, agree, move forward," said 
Fichera, an investment banker with Saber Partners in New York City. "The 
governor has put a 'I want this yesterday' fire" under his negotiating team. 
The negotiator, however, declined to say when he expects final agreements to 
be reached with the companies. 
"It could be days, it could be weeks," he said. 
There were signs, meanwhile, of trouble brewing on another front: the giant 
bond sale the state must make to repay the money it has spent so far on 
electricity and to finance future long-term contracts for energy. 
State Treasurer Phil Angelides said Wednesday the utilities are appealing a 
ruling by the state Public Utilities Commission that essentially ensures the 
state will be repaid, a move that he said threatens to delay the sale 
indefinitely. 
"If the utilities have decided to adopt a scorched earth policy until they 
get what they need and want, then it will be a significant problem," 
Angelides said. 
PG&E spokesman Ron Low said the governor is simply placing too many demands 
on a rate structure that doesn't compensate the utilities for their current 
costs. 
"Political rhetoric is not going to change the math," he said. 
In the Legislature, lawmakers are growing grumpier. Most were taken by 
surprise Monday when blackouts were ordered across the state, weeks before 
summer temperatures were expected to set in and strain the power system. 
"I'm more worried than ever," said Assemblyman Bill Leonard, R-San 
Bernardino. "A lot of the elements we thought we had a handle on in January 
are unraveling." 
A deal the governor said had been worked out weeks ago between the state and 
more than 600 small alternative energy suppliers collapsed last week. 
The alternative generators have not been paid by the utilities for months, 
and state leaders attempted to bargain down the price utilities pay those 
generators for power. 
But administration officials complained privately that lawmakers instead 
sweetened the pot for the suppliers to the point that the measure no longer 
helped solve the overall financial situation pushing the utilities toward 
bankruptcy. Under a proposal announced Tuesday by Davis, the Legislature 
would authorize the PUC to require the utilities to pay the alternative 
suppliers at prices more closely resembling the original deal. 
But the governor ran into immediate opposition, as some suppliers said said 
he would not pay them enough to cover their fuel costs. 
"We would go from not being paid, to losing money," said Hal Dittmer of 
Wellhead Electric, a Sacramento-based supplier that has been shut down for 
more than a month. "Almost everybody who burns natural gas is going to shut 
down. (Davis) got it wrong." 
Democrats outside the Davis administration, meanwhile, are complaining about 
the amount of money the state Department of Water Resources is spending on 
expensive, last-minute power purchases. Within a week, $4.2 billion will have 
been committed. 
State Sen. Steve Peace, D-El Cajon, chairman of the joint Legislative Budget 
Committee, is warning the Davis administration that he will block additional 
funds for last-minute purchases of power until the PUC makes progress 
recovering money that already has been spent. He intends to hold a hearing on 
the issue this morning. 
On Wednesday, state Controller Kathleen Connell told Davis she will refuse to 
make a routine budget transfer he had requested, saying she is concerned that 
there is "no outside check and balance" on the money the administration is 
spending to buy electricity on the spot market. 
As the statewide elected official who pays the state's bills, Connell said 
she has yet to receive information from the Department of Water Resources 
about how much it is spending. 
"We really need an accounting as to the total amount of liability they have 
accumulated," she said. "I understand they're in an emergency situation ... 
but it begins to imperil the state's ability to manage its cash flow." 
Meanwhile, a bill to provide $1 billion for conservation programs, aimed at 
reducing power needs this summer, also has languished for several weeks in 
the state Senate. While Davis has focused his attention elsewhere, Republican 
lawmakers have opposed the measure as too expensive. Democrats argue that 
each two-week delay prevents the state from saving as much energy as one 
"peaker" plant will produce this summer. Peaker plants are designed to help 
meet the peaks of electricity demand. 
"I'm the eternal optimist, but we have to keep working on all fronts," said 
Sen. Byron Sher, D-Palo Alto, who hopes to take his energy conservation bill 
up for a vote in the Senate again today. "It's a formidable challenge."

Legislators learn some details of power contracts
By John Hill
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published March 22, 2001) 
The veil of secrecy surrounding the state's electricity contracts lifted 
Wednesday -- a little. 
Gov. Gray Davis gave state legislators a report laying out some of the 
details of long-term contracts designed to help the state pull out of its 
energy crisis. But the report left legislators and others clamoring for more. 
"The information raises more questions," said Assemblyman George Runner, 
R-Lancaster. "I liken it to watching a parade through a knothole in a fence. 
You get to look at one float, but you're not sure about what's coming up and 
what you've missed." 
Davis had previously disclosed that the state had signed or was close to 
signing 40 long-term contracts, at an average price over 10 years of $69 per 
megawatt-hour. 
The contracts are part of the state's strategy for trying to avoid a fiscal 
shellacking in the energy spot market while making sure there's enough 
electricity to avoid more blackouts. 
Davis also previously disclosed that the contracts were for an average of 
about 9,000 megawatts a year, and that the total cost exceeded $40 billion. 
But Davis has resisted telling more, saying the state would jeopardize its 
ability to get the best prices if electricity generators knew what their 
counterparts were getting. 
On Wednesday, the governor's office released a March 15 report from S. David 
Freeman, general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, to 
the state Department of Water Resources. The state agency has been given the 
responsibility of making power purchases, and Freeman was brought in to lead 
the negotiations. 
As of March 15, the state had signed 19 contracts with seven suppliers for 
periods ranging from 14 months to 20 years, with many for three or five 
years, the report says. Some of the contracts are for electricity to meet the 
state's everyday power demand, while others are only for times of peak use, 
such as hot summer days. 
The state had "agreements in principle" for an additional 25 contracts. 
Runner said he has been told that two of these contracts have since been 
finalized. 
The amount of power provided reaches a peak in 2004 of more than 10,000 
megawatts. As the long-term contracts start to expire around then, the state 
is hoping that demand can be met with new contracts or spot purchases at 
prices expected to be much cheaper. 
The report says nine more long-term contracts were under discussion. 
Some of the contracts are with power generators, while others are with 
marketers who may get the power from a number of sources. 
In some cases, the state may supply the natural gas used to generate the 
electricity, or power costs may be pegged to the going rate for the fuel. 
Some suppliers can cancel if the state fails to sell bonds by a certain date 
to cover power costs or fails to maintain an investment grade credit rating. 
Some depend on the construction of power plants, but Freeman said they were 
firm commitments. 
"We were pretty careful not to put a hope and a dream in the portfolio," he 
said. 
More contracts will have to be signed to meet summer demand, and these 
agreements will probably be more expensive, the report says. 
One item not in Freeman's report was a secret deal to relieve several major 
generators from having to pay for polluting the air beyond allowable limits. 
The long-term power contracts include language that would have the state pay 
the costs of "pollution credits" that allow power plants to exceed their 
permitted levels of smog-forming pollutants, the governor's office confirmed 
Wednesday. Spokesman Steve Maviglio said that several generators are being 
relieved from having to pay those costs. 
V. John White, a Sierra Club lobbyist close to the negotiations, said Dynegy 
Inc., which has power plants in El Segundo, Encina and Long Beach, is one of 
them. Dynegy officials did not return calls to The Bee on Wednesday. 
Freeman said that generators were demanding hefty premiums for having to deal 
with air quality regulators in the summer and he figured it would be cheaper 
just to pay for the pollution credits. 
In other energy-related developments: 
With more power plants back online, grid operators dropped down to a Stage 1 
electricity alert. The state Independent System Operator was expecting 
supplies to gradually increase over the next few days. 
The state Public Utilities Commission issued a revised draft decision that 
would impose the prices outlined Tuesday by Davis for power produced by 
alternative energy companies -- $79 a megawatt-hour for five-year contracts 
or $69 a megawatt-hour for 10 years. The proposal is scheduled for a PUC vote 
March 27. 
A federal judge ruled that one of the nation's major electricity generators 
must continue supplying California with emergency power. 
In imposing an injunction on Reliant Energy Services Inc., U.S. District 
Judge Frank C. Damrell Jr. noted the "rolling blackouts (that have) darkened 
the California landscape" and said the loss of Reliant's production "poses an 
imminent threat." 
Bee staff writers Carrie Peyton, Chris Bowman and Denny Walsh contributed to

Federal judge orders major power wholesaler to sell to California 




By Don Thompson
ASSOCIATED PRESS 
March 21, 2001 
SACRAMENTO ) A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction Wednesday 
ordering a major electricity wholesaler to continue selling to California 
despite its fear that it will not get paid. 
U.S. District Judge Frank C. Damrell Jr. said Californians were at risk of 
irreparable harm if Reliant Energy Services stopped selling power to the 
Independent System Operator, which oversees the state's power grid. The ISO 
buys last-minute power on behalf of utilities to fill gaps in supply to try 
to fend off blackouts. 
Damrell dismissed Reliant's attempt to force the state Department of Water 
Resources to back the ISO's purchases for the state's two biggest utilities. 
The state has been spending about $50 million a day on power for Pacific Gas 
and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison, both denied credit by 
suppliers after amassing billions of dollars in debts. 








Controller: State's power spending imperils its financial health 
Governor says utilities must pay in advance for some power 
? 



The judge said he had no authority to force the DWR to pay for that power. 
Gov. Gray Davis has said the state isn't responsible for purchasing the 
costly last-minute power ISO buys for Edison and PG&E, despite a law 
authorizing state power purchases on the utilities' behalf. 
ISO attorney Charles Robinson said the ruling gives ISO operators "a tool to 
assist them in keeping the lights on in California." 
"Had the decision gone the other way, one could expect other generators to 
simply ignore emergency orders," Robinson said. 
Damrell's preliminary injunction will remain in effect until the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission rules on the matter. 
Damrell denied the ISO's request for preliminary injunctions against three 
other wholesalers, Dynegy, AES and Williams, who agreed to continue selling 
to the ISO pending the FERC ruling. 
The ISO went to court in February after a federal emergency order requiring 
the power sales expired. The judge then issued a temporary restraining order, 
requiring the sales, but dropped it after the suppliers agreed to continue 
sales to California, pending his Wednesday ruling. 
The ISO said it would lose about 3,600 megawatts if the suppliers pulled out, 
enough power for about 2.7 million households. One megawatt is enough for 
roughly 750 homes. 
Grid officials said Reliant's share alone is about 3,000 megawatts. Reliant 
said the amount at issue actually is less than a fourth of that, because most 
of the power is committed under long-term contracts. 
Reliant, which provides about 9 percent of the state's power, worries it 
won't get paid due to the financial troubles of PG&E and Edison. 
PG&E and Edison say that together they have lost about $13 billion since June 
due to soaring wholesale electricity costs that California's 1996 
deregulation law bars them from passing onto customers. 
At the same time, the state has faced a tight electricity supply, due in part 
to California power plant shutdowns for maintenance and to a tight 
hydroelectric supply in the Pacific Northwest. 
Managers of the state power grid imposed rolling blackouts across the state 
Monday and Tuesday as supply fell short of demand. Wednesday, cooling 
temperatures and the completion of repairs at several power plants allowed 
the state to avoid blackouts. 
State Controller Kathleen Connell said Wednesday that the energy crunch also 
imperils California's financial health. 
Connell said the state's power-buying on behalf of Edison and PG&E is is 
gutting its budget surplus. Since the state started making emergency power 
buys in January, the surplus has fallen from $8.5 billion to about $3.2 
billion, she said. 
Connell ordered an audit of the state's power-buying, saying Davis is 
withholding key financial information from her office and the Legislature. 
She is refusing a request by Davis and the Legislature to transfer $5.6 
billion into a "rainy day fund" she said was set up to impress Wall Street as 
the state prepares to issue $10 billion in revenue bonds to cover its 
power-buying. 
Transferring the money would leave the state general fund $2.4 billion in 
debt, Connell said. 
Sandy Harrison, spokesman for the state Department of Finance, and Keely 
Bosler of the Legislative Analyst's Office, said such transfers are routine 
and required by law. 
They put the state's budget surplus at $5.6 billion. 
"The law says she has to do it. The law does not give her the power to demand 
that kind of audit information," Harrison said. 
He said the state's budget isn't in danger because it will be repaid with the 
$10 billion in long-term debt. 
Wells Fargo & Co. chief economist Sung Won Sohn said he sees little progress 
in efforts to fix the state's power problems and end state electricity 
purchases. 
"If we're going to pour money into a bottomless pit, I would worry about the 
state's finances," he said. "At some point we're going to run out of money." 
The controller's criticism of fellow Democrat Davis won support from Assembly 
Republicans and Secretary of State Bill Jones, a Republican considering 
challenging Davis next year. 
Jones said he wants to announce his own plan to solve the state's energy 
woes, but can't unless Davis releases more financial details. 
Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio dismissed the criticism. 
"Political grandstanding doesn't generate one more kilowatt of energy for 
California in this time of emergency," he said. 
Maviglio said the administration has released the financial information it 
can without jeopardizing negotiations for long-term power contracts with 
wholesalers.

Controller: State's power spending imperils its financial health 



By Don Thompson
ASSOCIATED PRESS 
March 21, 2001 
SACRAMENTO ) California's power-buying on behalf of two strapped utilities is 
gutting its budget surplus and putting the state at financial risk, the state 
controller said Wednesday. 
The surplus dropped from $8.5 billion in January, when the state began buying 
electricity for Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison, 
to $3.2 billion now, Kathleen Connell estimates. 
Connell ordered an audit of the state's power-buying, saying Gov. Gray Davis 
is withholding key financial information from her office and the Legislature. 
Wednesday marked the first time in three days the state avoided rolling 
blackouts. Power grid officials credited cooling temperatures and the 
completion of repairs at several power plants. 
Connell said the energy crunch now imperils the state's budget as well as its 
electric grid. 
California has been spending about $45 million a day ) $4.2 billion so far ) 
to buy power for Edison and PG&E, both denied credit by electricity 
wholesalers. 
The two utilities, California's largest, say they are nearly $14 billion in 
debt due to soaring wholesale power costs the state's deregulation law blocks 
them from recovering from customers. 
Meanwhile, the state has faced high natural gas costs and a tight power 
supply driven in part by power plant repairs in California and scarce 
hydroelectric power in the Pacific Northwest. 
Standard & Poor's has put the state on a credit watch due to its power 
purchases and chastised Davis, the Legislature and state regulators for not 
taking more aggressive steps to assure the utilities can pay their bills. 
On Wednesday, Connell said she is refusing a request by Davis and the 
Legislature to transfer $5.6 billion into a "rainy day fund" she said was set 
up to impress Wall Street as the state prepares to issue $10 billion in 
revenue bonds to cover its power-buying. 
Transferring the money would leave the state general fund $2.4 billion in 
debt, Connell said.

and required by law. 
They put the state's budget surplus at $5.6 billion. 
"The law says she has to do it. The law does not give her the power to demand 
that kind of audit information," Harrison said. 
He said the state's budget isn't in danger because it will be repaid with the 
$10 billion in long-term debt. 
Connell said the scope of the proposed transfer is unprecedented and amounts 
to a "shell game" that disguises the power purchases' impact on the state 
budget. 
Wells Fargo & Co. chief economist Sung Won Sohn said he sees little progress 
in efforts to fix the state's power problems and end state electricity 
purchases. 
"If we're going to pour money into a bottomless pit, I would worry about the 
state's finances," he said. "At some point we're going to run out of money." 
The controller's criticism of fellow Democrat Davis won support from Assembly 
Republicans and Secretary of State Bill Jones, a Republican considering 
challenging Davis next year. 
Jones said he wants to announce his own plan to solve the state's energy 
woes, but can't unless Davis releases more financial details. He said his 
plan may involve giving the utilities low-interest loans with their 
transmission lines held as collateral. 
Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio dismissed the criticism. 
"Political grandstanding doesn't generate one more kilowatt of energy for 
California in this time of emergency," he said. 
Maviglio said the administration has released the financial information it 
can without jeopardizing negotiations for long-term power contracts with

Governor says utilities must pay in advance for some power 



By Jennifer Coleman
ASSOCIATED PRESS 
March 21, 2001 
SACRAMENTO ) The state's two largest utilities will be ordered to pay 
environmentally friendly power generators in advance, a move Gov. Gray Davis 
hopes will bring a quick end to the power blackouts that darkened California 
this week. 
The statewide blackouts that stretched from San Diego to Oregon on Monday and 
Tuesday were caused in part by the failure of Southern California Edison and 
Pacific Gas and Electric Co. to pay millions of dollars they owe "qualifying 
facilities" or QFs, Davis said. 
Such suppliers use cogeneration ) steam from manufacturing plus natural gas ) 
or solar, wind and other renewable energy to generate electricity. This week 
California lost about half the power those generators normally provide. 








Controller: State's power spending imperils its financial health 
? 



Several of them said they hadn't been paid by Edison and PG&E in weeks and 
can't afford to keep operating their plants. 
Davis accused the utilities of taking in money from customers while failing 
to pay the QFs. The state has been spending about $45 million a day since 
January to buy power for customers of Edison and PG&E, which are so 
credit-poor that suppliers refuse to sell to them. 
"It's wrong and irresponsible of the utilities to pocket this money and not 
pay the generators," the governor said at a Capitol news conference Tuesday 
evening. "They've acted irresponsibly and immorally and it has to stop." 
PG&E called the governor's statements "inappropriate and unjustified," adding 
that it was negotiating a payment plan with the QFs. Edison said it is intent 
on paying creditors and working with the California Public Utilities 
Commission to pay QFs for future power sales. 
Controller Kathleen Connell warned Wednesday that the state's $2 
billion-a-month power purchases are jeopardizing California's budget. 
The state's budget surplus dropped from $8.5 billion in January, when the 
power purchases began, to $3.2 billion now, Connell estimates. She blamed 
Davis for withholding key financial information, and ordered an audit of the 
state's power spending starting next week. 
She blocked a request by the Legislature and Davis administration to transfer 
$5.6 billion from the state's general fund into a special "rainy day" fund, 
saying that would have left the general fund $2.4 billion in debt. 
The Legislative Analyst's Office said such transfers are routine; Connell 
agreed, but said the size of the transfer is unprecedented. 
"We started this year with a generous budget surplus," Connell said. "The 
energy crisis has taken much of that away and this transfer on top of the 
electricity purchases would put the fund at risk." 
Meanwhile, keepers of the state's power grid were optimistic California would 
get through Wednesday without another day of rolling blackouts. Two plants 
down for repairs returned to service. 
Several power plants that were taken down for repairs are also expected come 
online by the end of the week, reducing the likelihood of blackouts, said Jim 
Detmers, ISO vice president. 
Power may flow to homes and businesses, but it could soon cost consumers 
more, said Assemblyman Fred Keeley, one of the Legislature's leaders on 
energy issues. 
"I think it's intellectually appropriate and honest to tell people as soon as 
it's apparent" that a rate increase is warranted, the Boulder Creek Democrat 
said Tuesday, indicating that time had come. 
He estimated that the state Public Utilities Commission may soon have to 
raise rates by about 15 percent to cover the state's costs and its utilities' 
bills. 
"My sense is that people will appreciate having some certainty and being able 
to plan for it," he said. "They don't have to like it but I think they'll 
appreciate it." 
Davis said he is confident the utilities and the state can pay their bills 
without further rate increases for Edison and PG&E customers. 
In the meantime, the Independent System Operator, keeper of the grid, is 
counting on continued conservation by residents and businesses to avoid more 
blackouts. Conservation accounted for about 300 megawatts in savings during 
Tuesday's peak usage, enough to power 300,000 homes. 
Roughly a half-million homes and businesses were affected by Tuesday's 
blackouts, which snarled traffic and plunged schools and businesses into 
darkness across the state. 
The outages began at 9:30 a.m. and continued in 90-minute waves until about 2 
p.m., when the ISO lifted its blackout order. They were blamed for at least 
one serious traffic accident. 
Two cars collided at an intersection in the Los Angeles suburb of South El 
Monte where the traffic lights were out. Two people were seriously hurt, said 
California Highway Patrol Officer Nick Vite. 
In San Francisco's Chinatown, souvenir shops normally bustling with visitors 
were forced to shut down. Nearby, irritated customers waited for a bank to 
reopen. 
The blackouts, like Monday's, were caused by a combination of problems, 
including unseasonably warm weather, reduced electricity imports from the 
Pacific Northwest and numerous power plants being shut down for repairs. 
Adding to those troubles, the state lost about 3,100 megawatts from the QF 
plants. 
Senate Energy Committee Chairwoman Debra Bowen, D-Marina del Rey, estimated 
Tuesday that Edison has amassed more than $1 billion and PG&E more than $2 
billion that they have not paid to generators. 
Davis said the PUC planned to issue an order next week directing the 
utilities to pre-pay their future QF bills. 
PG&E said its prepayments hinge on an upcoming PUC decision on whether the 
utility's rates are sufficient to pay its bills and cover the state's power 
purchases on its behalf, which amount to $4.2 billion since early January. 
Edison and PG&E say they have lost more than $13 billion since last June to 
climbing wholesale electricity prices, which the state's 1996 deregulation 
law prevents them from passing on to ratepayers.

Energy Overcharge of $5.5 Billion Is Alleged 

Power: Money should be refunded to taxpayers and utilities, the state grid 
operator says, citing evidence of market manipulation. Suppliers deny the 
accusation. 

By TIM REITERMAN and NANCY RIVERA BROOKS, Times Staff Writers 

?????Wholesale electricity suppliers overcharged California by about $5.5 
billion between May and last month, and that money should be refunded to the 
state's taxpayers and financially strapped utilities, the state power grid 
operator said Wednesday.
?????Generators engaged in market manipulation and consistent patterns of 
bidding far above costs in the deregulated energy market, the California 
Independent System Operator found in a study of pricing data. The findings 
support the widespread belief that these suppliers reaped massive additional 
revenue by manipulating the market.
?????Spokesmen for the companies denied the accusation.
?????The study, prepared for a filing with federal regulators today, is 
central to Cal-ISO's efforts to seek reimbursement for what it considers 
excessive charges by electricity suppliers during the state's energy crisis.
?????"This might be the first time we told them the total impact and 
magnitude [of the overcharging]," said Anjali Sheffrin, Cal-ISO's director of 
market analysis. "We think the entire amount deserves consideration for 
refunds."
?????Using confidential bidding data on tens of thousands of electricity 
sales, Cal-ISO found that five companies that together supply about 30% of 
the power delivered to customers of the state's investor-owned utilities 
engaged in two types of behavior that tended to push up prices:
?????* They effectively withheld supplies by bidding at excessive prices, 
even though they could have made some money selling more electricity.
?????* Less frequently, they had power generation available but did not bid 
at all.
?????The study concluded that energy suppliers commonly offered their 
electricity at twice their cost. For example, Sheffrin said, the average 
markup in August was 100% during peak hours.
?????A spokeswoman at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which 
oversees wholesale electricity pricing across the country, declined to 
comment Wednesday, saying, "This is part of an ongoing proceeding."
?????FERC member William L. Massey, who has considered previous commission 
actions on refunds to be inadequate, said it would be improper for him to 
comment on a report that has not yet been filed. But when told of the 
$5.5-billion total, Massey said: "That doesn't shock me in any way."
?????"Prices over the past 10 months in California have greatly exceeded the 
federal standards of just and reasonable prices, and I think they have 
exceeded the standards by possibly billions of dollars," he said.
?????Cal-ISO, which oversees grid operations and an emergency energy market, 
previously detailed $550 million in alleged overcharges for December and 
January and asked FERC for refunds. But the commission has proposed refunds 
of only a tiny fraction of that amount.
?????The study covered five major in-state power suppliers--Reliant Energy, 
Dynegy, Williams/AES, Duke Energy and Mirant, formerly Southern Energy--plus 
16 power importers, all of which deliver power to customers of Pacific Gas & 
Electric Co., Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric Co.
?????"All [21] overcharged, but some excessively and some by moderate 
amounts," Sheffrin said.
?????Cal-ISO's public filing will quantify the alleged overcharging by each 
company, but the companies will be identified only by a number. The code will 
be provided to FERC, Sheffrin said, and Cal-ISO lawyers will determine how 
much information about the companies will be made public.

?????State, U.S. Investigations
?????California electricity markets and the companies that buy and sell power 
in the state have been the subject of several investigations by state and 
federal authorities since wholesale electricity prices first skyrocketed in 
May.
?????Electricity suppliers have repeatedly denied manipulating the California 
market in any way, whether through above-cost bidding in spot markets or 
through physical withholding of electricity to drive up prices.
?????Reliant Energy is cooperating with FERC's requests for more data and is 
confident the commission will conclude that prices charged by Reliant were 
justified, said Joe Bob Perkins, president of the Houston-based company.
?????Perkins also bitterly disputed charges that Reliant has shut down units 
so that it can earn bigger profits on the power sold by the remaining plants. 
These charges have been leveled against all of the power-plant owners in the 
state.
?????Reliant Vice President John Stout said Cal-ISO's calculations typically 
don't include such fixed costs as salaries, taxes and the interest on bonds 
they sold to finance their power plants, which they acquired under terms of 
the state's landmark 1996 deregulation law.
?????In addition, he said, many high-priced power days have resulted from 
buyers bidding against each other for scarce supplies rather than sellers 
charging excessive amounts--like a house price being driven far above the 
listing price in a hot real estate market.
?????Williams Energy Services, a trading company that markets most of the 
power produced by plants owned by AES, also says it will be exonerated by 
FERC once the commission examines documentation being submitted, said Paula 
Hill-Collins, spokeswoman for the Tulsa, Okla., company.
?????"FERC has the obligation to investigate when these accusations are 
made," Hill-Collins said. "This is just a process of justification, not 
necessarily proof of guilt."
?????Williams/AES was recently ordered by FERC to prove that it did not take 
generating units out of service last year to drive up electricity prices, or 
refund $10.8 million to California utilities.
?????During the period studied, suppliers sold electricity in the California 
Power Exchange to Southern California Edison, PG&E and San Diego Gas & 
Electric Co. and in a backup market for last-minute electricity operated by 
Cal-ISO. But sky-high prices plunged Edison and PG&E deeply into debt, and 
most suppliers stopped selling to them in January, forcing the state 
Department of Water Resources to step in as the primary electricity buyer for 
the three big utilities' 27 million customers.
?????The Cal-ISO study, first summarized at an energy conference last week at 
UC Berkeley but not otherwise publicized, concluded that the companies 
exercised so-called market power to pump up electricity prices.
?????Severin Borenstein, director of the Energy Institute at Berkeley, said 
Cal-ISO's study is consistent with his research examining pricing practices 
in 2000.
?????"We found several billion dollars . . . in departures from competitive 
pricing," he said. "When the market was tight this summer, they were able to 
push up prices, and they did."
?????The early warning signs of electricity price spikes, the study found, 
appeared in May after two years of relatively stable prices of $30 to $40 per 
megawatt-hour under deregulation. Prices went up during the summer, dipped in 
September and October with lower demand, then took off in November and 
December as weather turned cold and the price of natural gas, which is used 
to generate much of the state's electricity, reached record levels.
?????"There were plant outages, and demand and supply became close," Sheffrin 
said. "Whatever price they bid had to be taken, and market power asserted 
itself."
?????Cal-ISO found that $3 billion of the alleged overcharges occurred 
between May and November.
?????On Friday, federal regulators ordered six wholesale power suppliers to 
refund $55 million to California if they cannot justify prices charged in 
February. The refund was limited to power sold that month in excess of $430 
per megawatt-hour during Stage 3 power alerts, when supplies are so tight 
that rolling blackouts are threatened. (One megawatt-hour is enough 
electricity to supply 750 typical homes for an hour.)
?????The previous week, FERC ordered 13 suppliers to justify or refund $69 
million for power sold in January at prices above $273 per megawatt-hour.
?????Massey opposed the potential refunds as too low because they were 
limited to hours in which a Stage 3 power emergency was in place and because 
the benchmark price set for each month was too high--combining to exempt more 
than 70,000 transactions from scrutiny.
?????"We're still looking for our lost wallet under the lamppost, which is 
Stage 3 alerts," said Massey, one of three commissioners on the five-member 
board (two seats are vacant).
?????Generators "have been given the free and clear," he said.
?????"These tinkling little refunds they have come out with recently are 
almost a joke," said Cal-ISO board member Mike Florio, senior attorney at the 
Utility Reform Network.

?????Resisting Price Caps
?????Cal-ISO contends that the last 10 months have proved that generators can 
no longer be allowed to receive electricity prices that are dictated by what 
the market will bear.
?????"FERC granted market-based rate authority on each of these suppliers' 
own showing that they could not manipulate prices, yet their actions have 
shown the contrary," Sheffrin said. "We feel FERC needs to look at the 
premise of allowing these generators to continue selling at market-based 
rates."
?????The commission is responsible for ensuring just and reasonable 
electricity rates. Although it has called California's power market 
dysfunctional and vulnerable to manipulation, the agency has resisted setting 
firm price caps sought by California's congressional delegation.
?????Chairman Curt L. Hebert Jr. strongly opposes caps, while Massey wants to 
use caps across the West as a "temporary timeout."
?????Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, in a New York news conference 
Wednesday, reiterated his opposition to electricity price caps as a way to 
cope with California's energy crisis.
?????"If we put price caps in place, there will be more blackouts, and 
they'll be worse," Abraham said.
?????Cal-ISO is filing its market study as part of its comments on FERC staff 
recommendations on ways to thwart market manipulation. FERC's proposal 
includes strict coordination of power plant outages by Cal-ISO with reporting 
of suspicious closures to FERC, and generator-by-generator bid caps tied to 
costs.

Power Strain Eases but Concerns Mount 

Energy: Officials say summer prices will be high, and a state report shows 
that contracts with generators are far short of goals. 

By DAN MORAIN and JENIFER WARREN, Times Staff Writers 

?????SACRAMENTO--California's fragile electricity system stabilized 
Wednesday, but a Davis administration report suggested troubles ahead because 
the state could be forced to buy most of its power for the coming summer on 
the costly and volatile spot market.
?????After two days of statewide blackouts, power plants that had been shut 
down were cranked up. Unseasonable heat tapered off. The operators of the 
statewide power grid relaxed their state of emergency.
?????But plenty of ominous signs remained. Many small producers remained shut 
down, skeptical about Gov. Gray Davis' plan for utilities to pay them.
?????State Controller Kathleen Connell issued a sharp warning about the high 
cost of the state's foray into the power business and announced that she will 
block an administration request that she transfer $5.6 billion into an 
account that could be tapped to pay for state purchases of electricity.
?????And a report from the administration summarizing contracts between Davis 
and independent power generators showed that the state has signed contracts 
for only 2,247 megawatts of electricity, significantly less than the 6,000 to 
7,000 megawatts previously claimed.
?????While there are agreements in principle for the full amount, the report 
notes that generators can back out of the contracts for a variety of reasons, 
including the state's failure to sell bonds to finance power purchased by 
July 1. The Legislature has approved plans to sell $10 billion in bonds, but 
none have yet been issued.
?????"We are exposed enormously this summer," Senate Energy Committee 
chairwoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey) said after looking at the report. 
"We owe the people the truth about how difficult this summer is going to be. 
We don't have a power fairy."
?????Perhaps most significant, the report suggests that the contracts fall 
significantly short of Davis' stated goal of buying no more than 5% of the 
state's summer needs on the spot electricity market, where prices can be many 
times those of long-term contracts.
?????After reading the report, Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economist 
who studies the California electricity market, said the numbers suggested 
that the state's long-term contracts will cover less than half of what the 
state will need this summer.
?????"We're definitely short this summer, next summer and the summer of 
2003," he said.
?????California was forced to start buying electricity in December--at a cost 
of $50 million a day--because producers refused to sell to Southern 
California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric. The two utilities amassed 
billions of dollars in debt when prices for wholesale power soared on the 
spot market.
?????Vikram Budhraja, a consultant retained by Davis to negotiate deals with 
generators, said the report represents a "work in progress." He said the 
state may yet sign new contracts.
?????However, Wolak said the contract figures confirm what he and others have 
been dreading: that summer is going to be rife with rolling blackouts unless 
serious steps to cut demand are taken immediately.
?????Wolak and other experts say large industrial customers must be switched 
to real-time meters and pricing to persuade them to use the bulk of their 
energy at times of low demand.
?????The head of the Energy Foundation, a San Francisco-based nonprofit that 
promotes sustainable sources of power, made the same proposal to Davis on 
Wednesday.
?????"The government need not ask customers to swelter in the dark this 
summer," foundation President Hal Harvey argued in a letter.
?????He also proposed a crash campaign to boost sales of efficient appliances 
and lightbulbs. He said the state needs to take over the utilities' contracts 
with alternative energy providers to ensure they stay in business, and sign 
new contracts for 1,500 megawatts of new wind power--the cheapest, fastest 
and cleanest source of new supply.
?????Davis had proposed a formula Tuesday to force private utilities to pay 
the alternative producers, some of which have not been paid since November. 
But some of them warned Wednesday that Davis' plan offers them little 
incentive to turn on their generators.
?????Alternative energy producers supply more than a quarter of the 
electricity consumed in California.
?????Many producers generate electricity from wind, sun and geothermal 
sources. But most of them generate power using natural gas--and the cost of 
natural gas has been soaring. Several natural gas users said Davis' plan, 
which caps rates, won't cover their fuel costs.
?????Davis assumes that the price of natural gas will fall. But small 
generators say they don't have sufficient purchasing power or sophistication 
to gamble on future prices.
?????The Public Utilities Commission is expected to approve Davis' proposal 
next week. It offers producers two choices: 7.9 cents a kilowatt-hour if they 
agree to supply power for five years, or 6.9 cents a kilowatt-hour over 10 
years.
?????"The price of natural gas is higher than that," said Marty Quinn, 
executive vice president and chief operating officer of Ridgewood Power LLC, 
which owns three natural gas-fired co-generation plants. "If we operate, 
we'll lose money."
?????Ridgewood is not operating, having been cut off by gas suppliers. The 
company sued PG&E last month seeking overdue payments and release from its 
contracts with the utility.
?????A hearing is scheduled in El Centro today in another lawsuit filed by a 
small energy producer, an Imperial Valley geothermal producer that sued 
Edison for refusing to let it break its contract and sell on the open market. 
CalEnergy says Edison owes it about $140 million for energy sold since 
November.
?????A company spokesman, Jay Lawrence, said CalEnergy was going ahead with 
its suit despite Davis' proposal. "We've had promises before," he said.
?????In other developments:
?????* A federal judge in Sacramento on Wednesday ordered Reliant Energy of 
Houston, a major producer, to continue selling power to California during 
emergencies, despite the company's argument that it may not be fully 
reimbursed. The order will remain in effect for 60 days or until the U.S. 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission decides a related case.
?????* Connell said the state budget surplus has shrunk to $3.2 billion 
because the state has spent roughly $2.8 billion on electricity. She 
criticized the administration for withholding basic information about state 
finances, and said she will begin an audit on Monday of the Department of 
Water Resources, which is responsible for purchasing power.
?????Davis' aides said Connell took her action because the Democratic 
governor endorsed one of Connell's foes this week in the race for Los Angeles 
mayor, former Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa. A Connell aide scoffed 
at the notion.
?????* Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said she "never has had a response" 
from President Bush after writing him last month for an appointment to 
discuss the California energy crisis.
?????In a wide-ranging lunch talk with reporters in Washington, she deplored 
the fact that "huge, huge profits are being made" in the California crisis, 
and said "an appropriate federal role" would be to guarantee a reliable 
source of power until the state can get nine new generators online.

Net Complex A Dilemma For San Jose 
SERVER FARM: Plant would tax grid 
David Lazarus, Chronicle Staff Writer
Thursday, March 22, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle

N236772.DTL 
San Jose, while trying to block construction of a new power plant, is set to 
approve a vast computer complex that could overwhelm California's already 
strained power grid. 
City officials gave preliminary approval last week to what would be the 
world's largest "server farm." The sprawling facility to handle Internet 
traffic would drain about 150 megawatts of power from the state electricity 
grid. 
If granted final authorization on April 3, the $1.2 billion project would add 
the equivalent of about 150,000 homes to California's power system, which was 
hit this week by rolling blackouts as demand for juice outstripped available 
supply. 
The server-farm issue highlights a vexing dilemma for the state. 
On the one hand, Gov. Gray Davis is calling for widespread conservation to 
help California overcome its current troubles. On the other, no one wants to 
curtail growth of the high-tech industry, which is an engine for economic 
vitality. 
"San Jose will make a lot of money from this project," said Craig Breon, 
executive director of the Santa Clara Valley Audubon Society. "But to not 
help the state out of its energy situation, there's a fair amount of 
hypocrisy going on." 
The server farm would be owned by U.S. DataPort, a San Jose data-management 
firm. As planned, it would occupy 10 buildings on more than 170 acres in the 
city's Alviso area. 
Total projected energy use would be 180 megawatts. About 30 megawatts would 
be generated by a small on-site facility, and the rest would have to be 
provided by Pacific Gas and Electric Co. 
"We're confident that the DataPort project will be approved because it's very 
important to San Jose and to the local economy," said San Jose Mayor Ron 
Gonzales. 
But PG&E already is saying that its power cupboard is bare. The utility "does 
not have sufficient existing electric infrastructure" to meet U.S. DataPort's 
needs, it said in a recent letter to San Jose officials. 
John Mogannam, U.S. DataPort's senior vice president of operations, countered 
that it could take as long as five years for the server farm to grow big 
enough to require the full 150 megawatts from the state grid. 
"Hopefully, by then the whole energy crisis will pass by, and we won't have a 
problem," he said. 
Mogannam stressed the positive aspects of the project, such as its ability to 
handle about 15 percent of global Internet traffic, the 700 jobs it would 
create, and the $70 million over 10 years it would generate for San Jose in 
property and utility taxes. 
"That's why the city likes it," he said. 
Indeed, San Jose officials are so enamored with such developments that they 
have all but turned a deaf ear to warnings that the server farm will 
exacerbate California's already dire power shortage. 
Andrew Crabtree, the city's senior planner, said the planning commission had 
barely touched the question of energy supply when it approved the server farm 
last week. 
"It wasn't incumbent on the commission to solve the state's energy-supply 
problems," he said. 
Rather, San Jose city planners focused on the environmental ramifications of 
the proposed facility, including air pollution from diesel generators and the 
impact on nearby wildlife. 
How it would affect dozens of burrowing owls in the area was a key topic of 
discussion. 
"We all recognized that there's a power shortage," Crabtree said. "But we 
couldn't do anything about that with this project." 
Except to make things tougher, of course. 
Server farms run 24 hours a day, seven days a week. They are an aspect of the 
high-tech boom that was never foreseen by energy experts, and which are now a 
major contributor to California's surging electricity demand. 
A server farm essentially is a large building filled with computers. Each 
computer handles the Web site or Internet traffic for hundreds of corporate 
clients that do not have the technical resources to look after such things 
in- house. 
Most server farms consume between 10 and 60 megawatts of power. At 180 
megawatts, the U.S. DataPort facility is billed as the most extensive data 
center on the planet. 
"There won't be another this size anywhere in the world," said Mogannam, the 
company's senior vice president. "This will be the biggest." 
With such a vast scale, however, comes additional concerns. For example, all 
that hardware will generate huge amounts of heat, requiring powerful air 
conditioners running around the clock to keep things cool. 
Patrick Dorinson, a spokesman for the Independent System Operator, which 
oversees California's electricity network, said server farms had "a big 
impact" on the state's tight energy supply. 
"We have an economy that's increasingly based on delivery of information," he 
observed. "We certainly need to make sure we're building adequate generation 
and transmission to get it there." 
As it stands, no major power plants have been built in California for the 
past 12 years, while dozens of server farms have sprung up throughout the 
state. 
The Yankee Group, a Boston consulting firm, estimates that the amount of 
space taken up by server farms nationwide rose to 9 million square feet from 
1999 to 2000. 
By 2003, it expects that figure to increase to 25 million square feet, or 
enough room for more than a hundred 10-story office buildings. 
San Francisco may be the exception. Supervisor Sophie Maxwell proposed 
interim zoning controls last week that would require server farms to receive 
special permission from City Hall to operate. 
San Jose, for its part, has no such reservations. It does, however, draw the 
line at big, fat power plants in the backyard of the city's leading corporate 
citizen. 
Gonzales is spearheading opposition to a proposed 600-megawatt generating 
facility in Coyote Valley because of its proximity to a residential area at 
the site of a planned Cisco Systems office complex. 
"There's plenty of opportunities to generate power in the city," he said. 
"This project is just in the wrong site." 
The matter is now in the hands of the California Energy Commission, which is 
expected to issue a ruling by May. 
Cisco, critics say, twisted the mayor's arm to fight the plant because it did 
not want a generating facility in its neighborhood. The area will be home to 
thousands of well-heeled tech workers. 
"It's politics," said Breon at the Audubon Society. "City officials are 
making political decisions rather than good planning decisions." 
Ted Smith, executive director of the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition, a 
grassroots organization, is calling for a moratorium on construction of all 
new server farms in the South Bay until sufficient power can be found to keep 
them running. 
"Until they figure out how to build these things without draining the 
electricity grid even dryer it is, they shouldn't build them," he said. 
"The Internet industry is creating unintended consequences that will really 
screw up our future," Smith added. "They are so busy focusing on next 
quarter's profits that they don't stop and think about the consequences." . 
. 
SOME FAST FACTS ABOUT 'SERVER FARMS'
. 
-- What are they? "Server farms" are facilities dedicated exclusively to 
housing powerful computers for Internet use. 
-- Who uses them? Companies and individuals pay server farms to maintain 
their Web sites, handle Net traffic and store vast amounts of data -- 
functions that otherwise would require extensive hardware and technical 
support. 
-- Why do they use them? As Internet use explodes, server farms play an 
increasingly vital role in managing data and keeping information moving. 
-- What's the problem? Server farms drain considerable amounts of electricity 
to keep running.

Contracts Won't Meet Summer Demands 
DETAILS: 2004 before full impact felt 
Lynda Gledhill, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau
Thursday, March 22, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle

N230640.DTL 

Sacramento -- Long-term power contracts negotiated by the state won't cover 
California's entire demand for electricity until 2004, according to newly 
released details about the agreements. 
The information suggests that California might have to scrounge for 
electricity on the high-priced spot market for a couple more years even as it 
continues to push conservation efforts and construction of more generating 
plants. 
Details of the agreements released by Gov. Gray Davis' administration show 
that the contracts will provide for just over a third of the state's demand 
for power this year. Energy secured by the contracts will grow to meet the 
expected demand in three years. 
Short-term purchases of power have at least temporarily depleted the state's 
budget surplus and have raised the possibility of sharp rate increases 
sometime in the future for electricity customers. 
Davis administration officials are banking on the hope that conservation 
efforts and increased generating capacity will cover the shortfall along with 
purchases of electricity on the spot market. 
"We're facing an extreme challenge still this summer," said Severin 
Borenstein, head of the University of California at Berkeley Energy 
Institute. "Signing contracts doesn't create more electricity." 
The information released did not include the names of companies that the 
state has signed contracts with or the purchase prices. 
The sketchy details did not satisfy frustrated lawmakers, who said many 
questions remain, especially how much the state will end up paying under the 
terms of the contracts. 
"The fundamental question is how much is it costing the state of California 
to keep the lights on," said Assemblyman Tony Strickland, R-Thousand Oaks. 
"What we really need is total disclosure." 
The state started buying power in January, after generators began refusing to 
provide electricity to the state's investor-owned utilities. Pacific Gas and 
Electric Co. and Southern California Edison say they have more than $13 
billion in past debt. 
The state has been spending $49 million a day on power purchases since Jan. 
17, according to documents obtained by The Chronicle last week. 
Those documents said the average price of the contracts across 10 years is 
$69 per megawatt hour, including summer peak. The five-year average price is 
$79 per megawatt hour. 
According to one chart provided by the governor's office yesterday, the 
long-term contracts will fall about 35 million megawatt hours short in 2002. 
Based on the average price per megawatt hour the state has been paying since 
January, that could end up costing between $6.6 billion and $13 billion. 
The law creating the state purchasing authority allowed purchases up to $10 
billion and extends until 2003. 
The governor's office said 21 contracts have been signed and another 23 
agreements that have been reached but not yet signed. 
Several generators have said that they will not sign contracts with the state 
until the back debt by the utilities has been taken care of. 
"We have some real potential problems," said Senate President Pro Tem John 
Burton, D-San Francisco. 
Strickland and several media outlets, including The Chronicle, have filed 
public information requests to get more information about the prices of the 
contracts from the administration. 
Releasing the information would jeopardize the negotiations for future 
contracts, said Steve Maviglio, Davis' spokesman. 
Lawmakers, also frustrated by the lack of information given out by the Davis 
administration, were not given notice that the information was coming, and 
many said it was lost in their mail pile. 
The cover letter was on Los Angeles Department of Water and Power letterhead, 
not that of the administration. The letter was written by S. David Freeman, 
head of the Los Angeles system who was on leave for the month of February to 
help the state negotiate the contracts. 
Assemblyman George Runner, R-Lancaster, said the "ambiguity of the 
information raises more questions than it answers." 
"It's like watching a parade through a peephole," he said. "He's showing us 
another float, but I don't know what the parade looks like." 
Blaming the state's purchases of electricity, Controller Kathleen Connell 
said yesterday that the state's cash on hand had fallen from $8.5 billion in 
January to $3.2 billion. Connell ordered an audit of the state's power 
buying. 
Connell said she would block a transfer sought by the Davis administration of 
$5.6 billion from the general fund to the state's emergency reserve account, 
claiming it would lead to a ''serious cash flow crisis." 
The transfer, however, is not related to the energy crisis. The sum 
represents a routine rollover of unspent money from the previous fiscal year. 
State law requires that money to be sent to a special reserve account for 
emergencies. 
Davis officials acknowledged that $3.7 billion in energy purchases have had 
an impact on state coffers, but they say the state will be repaid once bonds 
are issued in the coming weeks. They also said the state typically has its 
lowest cash reserves at this time of year. That changes in mid-April when a 
flood of income tax revenue pours in. 
"The transfer has nothing to do with energy purchases," said Sandy Harrison, 
a spokesman for the Department of Finance. 
"It's not helpful to ratepayers, taxpayers and people who want their lights 
to stay on to have the issue muddied with this sort of inaccurate innuendo," 
Harrison said. 
In other developments yesterday: 
-- After two days of statewide rolling blackouts, power grid managers avoided 
outages. Demand was lower because of cooler temperatures around the state and 
supply increased as several power plants completed repairs. 
-- A federal judge in Sacramento ordered a major power generator to continue 
supplying power to California. Reliant Energy Services Inc. had insisted that 
it should not be forced to sell to debt-heavy utilities unless the state 
guaranteed the bills.

California overcharged $5.5 bln for wholesale power 
SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Electricity wholesalers overcharged California 
$5.5 billion over the past 10 months, according to a report by managers of 
the state's power grid. 
The five companies, among other things, frequently offered electricity at 
prices double what it cost them to produce, concludes the California 
Independent System Operator study, which was published Thursday in the Los 
Angeles Times. 
``All overcharged, but some excessively and some by moderate amounts,'' said 
Anjali Sheffrin, the ISO's director of market analysis. 
The Times said the ISO planned to file the study with federal regulators 
Thursday and are demanding that the money be paid back. 
The companies denied the allegations, adding they expect the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission will determine their prices were justified. 
The commission has recently stepped up its scrutiny of power companies' 
behavior during California's power crisis, asking suppliers to justify $124 
million in sales during the first two months of the year or refund the money. 
Critics claim thousands of additional questionable sales are not being 
challenged. 
The ISO study alleges the wholesalers manipulated the market by bidding at 
excessive prices, effectively withholding supplies, or by not bidding at all 
when they had generation capability available. 
California has been spending about $45 million a day -- $4.2 billion since 
January -- to purchase power for Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern 
California Edison. Both utilities, the state's largest, have been cut off by 
electricity wholesalers because their credit is almost worthless. 
State Controller Kathleen Connell said Wednesday that the state's 
power-buying is gutting its budget surplus. Since the state started making 
emergency power buys, the surplus has fallen from $8.5 billion to about $3.2 
billion, she said. 
A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction Wednesday ordering a major 
electricity wholesaler, Reliant Energy Services, to continue selling to 
California despite its fear that it will not be paid. 
U.S. District Judge Frank C. Damrell Jr. said Californians were at risk of 
irreparable harm if Reliant stopped selling power to the ISO, which buys it 
at the last minute on behalf of utilities to bolster supplies and try to fend 
off rolling blackouts. 
Such blackouts hit the state twice this week. On Wednesday, cooling 
temperatures and the completion of repairs at several power plants allowed 
the state to avoid blackouts. 
Standard & Poor's has put the state on a credit watch due to its power 
purchases and chastised Gov. Gray Davis, the Legislature and state regulators 
for not taking more aggressive steps to make sure the utilities can pay their 
bills. 
Edison and PG&E say they are nearly $14 billion in debt due to soaring 
wholesale power costs. The state's deregulation law blocks them from 
recovering the costs from customers. 
Connell ordered an audit of the state's power-buying, saying Davis is 
withholding key financial information from her office and the Legislature. 
She said she would refuse to transfer $5.6 billion into a ``rainy day fund'' 
she said was set up to impress Wall Street as the state prepares to issue $10 
billion in revenue bonds to cover its power buys. Transferring the money 
would leave the state general fund $2.4 billion in debt, Connell said. 
She called the scope of the proposed transfer unprecedented and said it 
amounted to a ``shell game'' that disguises the power purchases' effect on 
the state budget. 
Sandy Harrison, spokesman for the state Department of Finance, and Keely 
Bosler, of the Legislative Analyst's Office, said such transfers are routine 
and required by law. They put the state's budget surplus at $5.6 billion. 
``The law says she has to do it. The law does not give her the power to 
demand that kind of audit information,'' Harrison said. 
Harrison said the state's budget isn't in danger because it will be repaid 
with the revenue bonds. 
Connell's criticism of Davis, a fellow Democrat, won support from Assembly 
Republicans and Secretary of State Bill Jones, a Republican who may challenge 
Davis next year. 
Jones said he wants to announce his own plan to solve the state's energy 
woes, but can't unless Davis releases more financial details. 
Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio dismissed the criticism. 
``Political grandstanding doesn't generate one more kilowatt of energy for 
California in this time of emergency,'' he said. 
Maviglio said the administration has released the financial information it 
can without jeopardizing negotiations for long-term power contracts with 
wholesalers.

If the power goes off 
Thursday, March 22, 2001 
For most of us, rolling power blackouts are a nuisance. For some people, it 
could mean life or death. 
"In Laguna Hills, cancer patient Ruben Marquez said the blackout interrupted 
and prolonged his dialysis treatment. He was unharmed," the Register reported 
on Monday's blackouts, which hit about 1.2 million Californians, including 
100,000 Orange County homes and businesses. 
What can people do to prevent disaster? 
"They and their families should have a backup plan," Rebecca Long, 
spokesperson for the Orange County Red Cross, told us. 
"The Red Cross recommends in general that you plan for this as you would for 
any disaster, making sure you have battery-operated radios and flashlights. 
We do not recommend candles for an emergency," because of the fire hazard. 
She recommended a Web site: www.prepare.org
People with special health needs, such as electric-powered respirators and 
oxygen machines, also should register with the power company.
"There's a whole classification" for such persons with health needs, Southern 
California Edison spokesperson Clara Potes-Fellow told us.
"The list is for us to alert them that the power could be discontinued. They 
arrange to have power through other means, batteries or generators. We 
recommend that they have a battery backup of eight hours. Therefore, if the 
rotating outages are one hour, they will have plenty."
Even though the power company has such people's names, she said, "we don't 
inform them in advance because we have just minutes from when the Independent 
System Operator," which directs where the electrons go, orders Edison to 
implement a power outage on the grid Edison owns. "By the time it took to 
call people, the outage would be over."
What's the problem at the ISO? "We notify as best we can," Pat Dorinson, ISO 
director of communications, told us. 
"The object is to keep the lights on. Sometimes it's just a moment's notice" 
before a blackout. "It makes [giving more notice] pretty difficult. We're 
looking into ways to make the system better." 
In the meantime, citizens will have to keep taking precautions.
We can't help noting that free market pricing, instead of politically-driven 
prices, would much more likely make electricity available, albeit at higher 
prices. 
We would expect, too, there would be hardship allowances, donations and 
level-pay plans to accommodate various types of needs.

Socialized electricity 
Thursday, March 22, 2001 
Government control of state power won't add one watt for consumers' use




TOM MCCLINTOCK
Sen. McClintock, R-Thousand Oaks, represents the 19th state Senate District 
in the state Legislature. 

In a city where bad ideas never die, Sacramento is once again host to a 
variety of plans for the government takeover of California's power system. 
The private sector, it is said, has done such a terrible job of providing 
electricity that government must now step in to save the day. Thus, the 
Legislature is awash in proposals to spend billions of dollars of public 
money to acquire existing power facilities. Fifteen billion dollars has 
already been authorized for this purpose, and an additional $10 billion is 
pending in the Senate. 
Meanwhile, Gov. Davis is losing about a $1.5 billion a month day-trading in 
the electricity market. The irony is that after the expenditure of as much as 
$25 billion for "public power,'' not a single inch will have been added to 
the transmission lines, nor a single watt to the generating capacity of 
California.
The root of California's crisis is a catastrophic shortage of electricity. In 
a shortage, prices rise or blackouts occur. To reduce prices and avoid 
blackouts, the only permanent solution is to increase the supply. Merely 
changing the ownership of existing facilities leaves Californians with 
exactly the same shortage, only billions of dollars the poorer for it. 
Government takeover advocates argue that at least a government power 
authority will protect consumers against price gouging and poor management. 
Unfortunately, government power authorities don't insulate against price 
gouging. The biggest price gouger in this entire crisis has been the Los 
Angeles Department of Water and Power, which was generating electricity for 
$51 per megawatt hour and selling it back to California ratepayers for as 
much as $1,400. 
Nor does a government takeover assure better management. Just a few years 
ago, the LADWP was buried in $7 billion in debt. The Sacramento Municipal 
Utilities District was a managerial laughing stock, having squandered 
hundreds of millions of dollars for a nuclear plant it barely used.
"Say what you will,'' the government takeover advocates reply, "when push 
came to shove, the municipal utility districts of California are in great 
shape, while the private utilities are a basket case.'' But one needs to look 
at the reason. Ever since the state reorganized the electricity market in 
1996, the municipal utility districts were allowed to trade in a free market, 
while the private utilities were forced to buy power exclusively in a 
Soviet-style power exchange where the highest bid during an hour set all 
prices.
The municipal utilities were able to retain their generators. Government 
forced the private utilities to sell theirs. The municipal utilities were 
able to enter into long-term contracts. Government prevented the private 
utilities from doing the same thing. The municipal utilities were able to 
negotiate the lowest prices available for power. Government forced the 
private utilities to pay the outlandish prices on the government's power 
exchange. The municipal utilities were allowed to adjust their rates to 
reflect the actual cost of power to consumers. Government forced the private 
utilities to sell at astronomical losses.
The final argument is simply an ideological one: that power is just too 
important to be left in private hands. Really? Food is a great deal more 
important and private hands have kept this nation well fed for centuries. 
Picturing the Department of Motor Vehicles running the local supermarket 
should sober even the most euphoric of the government takeover advocates.
California's Independent System Operator is predicting a 6,000-megawatt 
shortfall this summer. When there is no electricity on the transmission 
lines, it really won't matter who owns them. During the hottest hours of the 
hottest days of the year, when as many as 6 million homes are without 
electricity, it may begin to dawn on most people that socialism doesn't work 
any better in California than it did in the Soviet Union.

NEWS 
Bush's Energy Policy Will Backfire, Feinstein Warns / She wants federal price 
controls now
Carolyn Lochhead

03/22/2001 
The San Francisco Chronicle 
FINAL 
Page A.3 
(Copyright 2001) 
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., warned yesterday that when blackouts 
intensify in California this summer, the pressure will intensify on the Bush 
administration to explain why it rejected price controls on wholesale 
electricity. 
"If by this summer California is, as anticipated, facing these blackouts, and 
the federal government won't help, I don't think the American people are 
going to be very pleased," Feinstein told California reporters. 
Asked if help means the cost-based price controls Feinstein is pushing, she 
said, "Right now, yes." 
Feinstein said California Democrats will begin to escalate their criticism of 
the administration, predicting that support will build among Western senators 
for her legislation to impose price caps on wholesale electricity in exchange 
for lifting the rate cap on California consumers. 
If it passes, she said, "the administration is really going to have to face 
whether they're going to help or not help." 
Feinstein said House Democrats from the West Coast also told her they expect 
that White House inaction on price caps would help them gain seats in 2002. 
But she refused to speculate on the political fallout from the energy crisis 
against Democrats in California . 
Feinstein characterized Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham's adamant arguments 
against price controls as "recalcitrant," saying his statement to a Senate 
committee last week "essentially said California 's on its own." 
She speculated that because " California is dominantly Democratic, even 
somebody like me that works across party lines is beginning to wonder if this 
isn't an unnecessarily barbed stick at California ." 
White House spokesman Ken Lisaius disputed the charge, saying the Bush 
administration is doing all it can, but can't control that demand is 
outstripping supply. 
"The federal government cannot prevent blackouts, but can only help at the 
margins in situations like this," Lisaius said. "The only thing that can 
prevent blackouts is reduced demand, increased supply and good weather." 
Abraham has twice in the last week argued strongly against price controls, 
including the cost-based ones Feinstein advocates, saying they could increase 
blackouts by discouraging power sales into the Western electricity grid. 
He also said many power providers, including the federal Bonneville Power 
Administration in the home district of Sen. Gordon Smith, the Oregon 
Republican co-sponsoring Feinstein's bill, would be exempt from federal price 
caps. Feinstein disputed that, but Smith's office agreed. 
Abraham argued that price controls would not work in part because roughly 
half the Western electricity market would be exempt, including federal power 
marketing authorities such as Bonneville, rural electric cooperatives and 
municipal utilities such as the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. 
On another front, House Republicans omitted from their budget projected 
revenues from opening part of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and 
gas exploration. 
A Budget Committee spokeswoman said Chairman Jim Nussle, R-Iowa, determined 
that the $1 billion in revenues from the wildlife refuge the Bush 
administration included in its budget were not needed and that there was "no 
reason to put in something that controversial, that some of our members don't 
even like, when you don't have to." 
But Rep. Gary Miller, R-Diamond Bar (Los Angeles County) said House 
Republicans "are not backing off at all" from opening the wildlife refuge to 
drilling. "Our goal is to get it passed in the House," he said, saying the 
Budget Committee omitted the revenue projections because the drilling has not 
yet been approved.

Reliant Still In Power Pact Talks With Calif. DWR 
By Christina Cheddar

03/22/2001 
Dow Jones News Service 
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
 
  (This report was originally published late Wednesday.) 
   
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) remains in discussions with 
the California Department of Water Resources to sign long-term power 
contracts. 
However, issues regarding the creditworthiness of the agency remain, said Joe 
Bob Perkins, president of Reliant's Wholesale Division. 
"We want to be part of the solution," Perkins said. At the same time, Reliant 
is trying to protect itself from incurring additional unpaid accounts 
receivable, he said. 
The DWR has been buying power on behalf of California 's financially troubled 
utilities. However, Reliant has yet to sign a formal agreement with the 
agency because Reliant is concerned it won't be paid. 
During a conference call Wednesday, Perkins said he couldn't comment on a 
lawsuit between Reliant and the California Independent System Operator 
because he didn't know how it was progressing. 
Further court action on the case is expected Wednesday. 
The lawsuit stems from Reliant's desire not to be required to sell power to 
California if the state won't guarantee payment. The Houston energy company 
is concerned that it won't be paid for power being bought by the ISO on 
behalf of Edison International's (EIX) Southern California Edison unit and 
PG&E Corp.'s (PCG) Pacific Gas & Electric Co. unit. 
To date, Reliant is owed "some $370 million" from unpaid power sales to the 
utilities. 
Much of Perkins' presentation centered on how the power crisis in California 
emerged. 
Using data from research firm Cambridge Energy Research Associates, the 
company discussed the imbalance between California 's power demand and its 
power supply. 
Looking ahead to the summer, it isn't a question of whether rolling blackouts 
will occur, but "how many and how severe," Perkins said. 
Low hydroelectric availability, loss of imported power, warm weather, demand 
growth and plant outages could lead to a worst-case scenario in California , 
he said, adding that some estimates predict California could experience 1,100 
hours of power outages this summer. 
The skyrocketing power prices in the region are a reflection of the power 
market's imbalance, he said. 
Reliant submitted only "economically sound" bids for power, Perkins said. He 
expects the company can document why it charged the prices it did as required 
by regulators. 
"We have been very rigorous and very disciplined in what we have submitted," 
Perkins said. 
He added that retail customer price increases are one way of sending a signal 
to consumers to lower consumption. He cited studies that show a 20% retail 
price increase could reduce consumption by 2,000 megawatts. A megawatt is 
enough power to serve roughly 1,000 homes.

CPUC Must Address Rates In QF Repayment Order - SoCal Ed

03/22/2001 
Dow Jones Energy Service 
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
(This article was originally published Wednesday) 
   
LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- Any order from the California Public Utilities 
Commission requiring utilities to pay small, independent generators going 
forward must determine how that could be done within the existing rate 
structure, a spokesman for Edison International (EIX) utility Southern 
California Edison said Wednesday. 
The utility was responding to a PUC proposed decision that would require 
utilities to pay small generators, called qualifying facilities, $79 a 
megawatt hour within 15 days of electricity delivery. The decision will be 
voted March 27 by the CPUC. 
"We're still reviewing (the decision) and should have more to say in a day or 
two. To the extent that the commission orders us to pay going forward of 
course we will. But it needs to address how we will pay the QFs," a SoCal 
Edison spokesman said. 
SoCal Edison and PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric Co. are 
struggling under nearly $13 billion in uncollected power costs due to an 
inability to pass high wholesale power costs to customers under a rate 
freeze. 
Gov. Gray Davis Tuesday blasted the utilities for not having paid their QF 
bills in full since December. Pacific Gas & Electric Co. has made some 
partial payments to QFs, but SoCal Edison has paid nothing. Together, they 
owe the QFs about $1 billion, but the order doesn't address that debt. 
An Edison executive said, in reaction to the governor's sharp comments, that 
the company simply doesn't have the money to pay creditors. 
"The root problem here is there just isn't enough money in the current rate 
base to pay our bills," said Edison Senior Vice President of Public Affairs 
Bob Foster. "We understand the financial distress (the QFs) face; we are 
facing financial distress ourselves." 
The proposed PUC order would also require the state's investor-owned 
utilities to offer the small generators five- and 10-year contracts for power 
for $79/MWh and $69/MWh, respectively. 
The QFs "may be able to live with" the PUC proposal, but the five- and 
10-year contract prices may be inadequate if natural gas prices at one of the 
California borders are high, said Jan Smutny-Jones, president of the 
Independent Energy Producers Association. Natural gas prices into California 
are currently higher than anywhere in the country. 
But some say the proposed decision may not be enough to prevent the QFs from 
filing involuntary bankruptcy proceedings against the utilities for the money 
they are still owed. 
"There's still a lot of skepticism. To say our position has changed based on 
the CPUC decision or the governor's announcement is not accurate. A lot still 
has to happen," said Jay Lawrence, a spokesman for a renewable creditors 
committee.

Calif Small Pwr Producers To Shut Plants If Rates Capped
By Jason Leopold

03/22/2001 
Dow Jones Energy Service 
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
 
(This article was originally published earlier Thursday.) 
   
LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- Many of California 's independent power producers 
late Wednesday threatened to take their small power plants offline this week 
if state lawmakers pass legislation that would cap the rates the generators 
charge for electricity they sell directly to the state's three investor-owned 
utilities. 
At issue is a bill that would repeal a section of the state's Public 
Utilities Code, which links the 688 so-called qualifying facilities' 
electricity rates to the monthly border price of natural gas. 
Lawmakers, however, are poised to pass the legislation. 
State regulators are then expected to approve a measure that would 
restructure the fluctuating rates the QFs charge PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit 
Pacific Gas & Electric , Edison International (EIX) unit Southern California 
Edison, and Sempra Energy (SRE) unit San Diego Gas & Electric from $170 a 
megawatt-hour to $69-$79/MWh, regardless of the price of natural gas. 
Whereas each of the 688 QF contracts differed, largely because natural gas 
prices are higher in Southern California than Northern California , the state 
wants the QFs to sign a general contract with the utilities. 
The cogeneration facilities, which produce about 5,400 megawatts of 
electricity in the state, said the rates are too low and they won't sign new 
supply contracts with the utilities. 
"For $79/MWh, natural gas would have to be $6 per million British thermal 
unit at the Southern California border," said Tom Lu, executive director of 
Carson-based Watson Cogeneration Company, the state's largest QF, generating 
340 MW. "Our current gas price at the border is $12.50." 
Other gas-fired QFs said the state could face another round of rolling 
blackouts if lawmakers and state regulators pass the legislation, which is 
expected to be heard on the Senate floor Thursday, and allow it to be 
implemented by Public Utilities Commission next week. 
Lu, whose company is half-owned by BP Amoco PLC (BP) and is owed $100 million 
by SoCal Ed, said the proposals by the PUC and the Legislature "will only 
make things worse." 
David Fogarty, spokesman for Western States Petroleum Association, whose 
members supply California with more than 2,000 MW, said the utilities need to 
pay the QFs more than $1 billion for electricity that was already produced. 
 
  State Loses 3,000 MW QF Output Due Of Financial Reasons 
   
The QFs represent about one-third, or 9,700 MW, of the state's total power 
supply. Roughly 5,400 MW are produced by natural gas-fired facilities. The 
rest is generated by wind, solar power and biomass. 
About 3,000 MW of gas-fired and renewable QF generation is offline in 
California because the power plant owners haven't been paid hundreds of 
millions of dollars from cash-strapped utilities SoCal Ed and PG&E for nearly 
four months. 
Several small power plant owners owed money by SoCal Ed have threatened to 
drag the utility into involuntary bankruptcy if the utility continues to 
default on payments and fails to agree to supply contracts at higher rates. 
The defaults have left many of the renewable and gas-fired QFs unable to 
operate their power plants because they can't afford to pay for the natural 
gas to run their units. Others continue to produce electricity under their 
contracts with the state's utilities but aren't being paid even on a forward 
basis. 
The California Independent System Operator, keeper of the state's electricity 
grid, said the loss of the QF generation was the primary reason rolling 
blackouts swept through the state Monday and Tuesday. 
Gov. Gray Davis, recognizing the potential disaster if additional QFs took 
their units offline, held marathon meetings with key lawmakers Monday and 
Tuesday to try and hammer out an agreement that would get the QFs paid on a 
forward basis and set rates of $79/MWh and $69/MWh for five and 10 year 
contracts. He also said he would direct the PUC to order the utilities to pay 
the QFs for power they sell going forward. 
"After next week the QF problem will be behind us," Davis said Tuesday. "We 
want to get the QFs paid...the QFs are dropping like flies...and when that 
happens the lights go out." 
But this just makes the problem worse, said Assemblyman Dean Florez, 
D-Shafter, a member of the Assembly energy committee. 
"I don't know how we are going to keep the lights on," Florez said in an 
interview. "Many of these congenerators are in my district. They said if the 
legislation doesn't change they are going offline. This compounds the issue 
of rolling blackouts, especially now when we need every megawatt." 
Davis, who didn't meet with people representing the QFs, said he was handing 
the QF issue to the PUC because lawmakers failed to pass legislation that 
would have set a five-year price for natural gas and allow the QFs to sign 
individual contracts with the utilities. In addition, SOCal Ed opposed the 
legislation, saying the rates should be below $50/MWh. 
Some renewable power producers said they aren't vehemently opposed to the new 
rate structure because it guarantees them a higher rate than what was 
originally proposed. 
 
        QFs Want Third Party Supply Contracts 
   
John Wood, who represents the SoCal Ed Gas Fired Creditors Committee, one of 
a handful of groups that have formed since January to explore options on 
getting paid by the utilities, said his group of gas-fired QF creditors want 
to be released from their supply contracts and sell to third parties. 
"Under our plan, we would be permitted to sell electricity to third parties 
(including the state Department of Water Resources) until a resolution to the 
crisis can be accomplished," wood said. 
Hal Dittmer, president of Sacramento-based Wellhead Electric in Sacramento, 
which is owed $8 million by PG&E, has 85 MW of gas-fired generation units 
offline. 
Under the state's plan, Dittmer said he risks going out of business. 
"I can't buy natural gas for what I would be paid under this decision," he 
said. "The state needs to quit kidding themselves that they don't need to 
raise electricity rates. All of this is being driven by an artificial 
construct that California can avoid raising rates."

Rate hike in the offing
By Mike Taugher
TIMES STAFF WRITER 
SAN FRANCISCO -- An energy crisis that has already brought widespread power 
blackouts is now set to hit Californians' bank accounts with a large rate 
increase that is headed for approval today. 
State regulators are weighing a 30 percent hike on electricity rates that 
would come on top of a smaller, temporary rate increase that was adopted in 
January. The temporary increase also is expected to be made permanent today 
by the Public Utilities Commission. 
Still to be determined is the question of who will bear the brunt of the rate 
increases, which are expected to appear on the May bills of California's 7.5 
million utility customers. 
Loretta Lynch, president of the Public Utilities Commission, said the rate 
increases are needed to replenish more than $4 billion in ongoing electricity 
purchases by the state treasury and allow utilities to continue to buy 
electricity from alternative energy companies. 
The rate increase also satisfies conditions that are needed before the state 
can borrow $10 billion or more to finance its power buys. 
Lynch also said she will propose a tiered rate structure that would penalize 
those who use the most electricity and leave nearly half the state's utility 
customers, who use relatively little, untouched by the increase. 
Seen as inevitable by many observers, the politically volatile issue of rate 
hikes is nevertheless another admission that the state's foray into 
electricity deregulation, which was supposed to lead to cheaper and more 
plentiful electricity, has failed. 
Consumer groups, calling the proposed rate hikes a $4.8 billion gift to 
utilities, responded by saying they would hasten plans to take the state's 
energy mess to voters through a ballot initiative. Among their proposals: 
rolling back rates, forcing a state takeover of power plants or implementing 
an excess profits tax on energy companies. 
"The ratepayer revolt is under way," said Harvey Rosenfield, president of the 
Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. "The voters are going to have to 
take matters into their own hands at the ballot box. It will be a bloodbath." 
Meanwhile, Gov. Gray Davis immediately distanced himself from the rate-hike 
proposal. 
"The governor believes tiered pricing could promote the conservation 
California needs if structured properly but was not convinced of that by the 
data made available to him last week," according to a statement from Davis' 
office Monday. "He has asked for more information, which should be available 
this week. The governor has not had conversations with any commissioners 
about a potential rate hike. It is still his hope and expectation that this 
matter can be resolved within the existing rate structure." 
Some observers were incredulous, noting Davis' reputation as a micromanager 
who keeps appointees on a short leash. 
"The PUC has been run like his personal cabinet for a year and a half," said 
Gary Ackerman, director of the Western Power Trading Forum, a Menlo 
Park-based association of electricity generators and traders. "This one's got 
me floored. The governor once again is a day late. The Oscars for best actor 
were last night." 
Confronted with teetering utilities, alternative energy companies that were 
refusing to sell power in the state and state coffers bleeding by about $50 
million a day, Lynch unveiled a set of four interwoven decisions that the 
commission is scheduled to vote on today. 
The measures would: 
Raise consumer rates by 3 cents per kilowatt-hour, and make permanent a 1 
cent temporary hike implemented in January. Before the January rate hike, 
Pacific Gas & Electric Co. customers paid a 9.4 cents per kilowatt-hour for 
electricity, 5.4 cents of which was earmarked for the utility's energy buys. 
If the hike is approved, those figures will rise to 13.4 cents per 
kilowatt-hour on average, 9.4 cents of which will be used for electricity 
purchases. 
Determine how much of that money will be used to reimburse the state 
treasury, which has committed more than $4 billion to electricity purchases 
since mid-January. Lynch said Monday that although the state has not yet 
submitted data on its power buys, she believes the proposed rate hike will 
fully reimburse state coffers. 
Order the utilities to pay alternative energy companies, some of which have 
shut down operations because they are not getting paid. The order would apply 
to buys already under contract but not to the $1.5 billion that the utilities 
owe for electricity already used. 
Launch a PUC investigation into whether the utilities have improperly 
sheltered profits in their holding companies and subsidiaries. 
The proposals focus on the state's power buys and the utilities' upcoming 
power purchases and do nothing to address directly the mountain of debt that 
the utilities have accumulated. PG&E and Southern California Edison owe banks 
and energy companies billions. 
"We're still going through the proposed decisions and would like to wait 
until we have fully analyzed the material before we comment on it," said Ron 
Low, a spokesman for PG&E. 
By raising rates, state regulators would lessen the severity of blackouts 
this summer but would probably not prevent them entirely, according to 
industry groups. 
"In any circumstance, we're going to have a very difficult summer," said Jan 
Smutny-Jones, director of the Independent Energy Producers Association. "It's 
too early to say how sufficient it is, but it (the commission's willingness 
to raise rates) is an important recognition of reality." 
Lynch acknowledged the measures will only partly address electricity 
problems. 
She called on federal regulators to impose regionwide caps on the wholesale 
electricity market and order more refunds when prices have been unreasonably 
high. 
If the commission adopts the rate hike today, its next step will be to 
determine who pays what portion.

Power rate hike reaction mixed
Wall Street likes proposal, but local business leaders have some misgivings 
BY RICK JURGENS 
TIMES STAFF WRITER 
The electricity rate hike proposed Monday by the state's top utility 
regulator elicited cheers on Wall Street, where the prices of California 
utility stocks rose about 30 percent, but got a more cautious reaction from 
local business leaders. 
"This is a regrettable necessity," said Justin Bradley, energy program 
director for the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group, a San Jose-based group 
of 190 technology employers. 
A rate hike won't in itself solve the state's electricity crisis, said Bruce 
Kern, executive director of the Economic Development Alliance for Business in 
Oakland. Reliability is the key business concern about electricity, and 
restoring reliability will require more generating capacity and conservation 
assistance for companies, he said. 
Despite a surge in wholesale electricity costs since April 2000, California 
regulators have allowed only a 9 percent increase in retail prices and Gov. 
Gray Davis has adamantly rejected calls for further rate hikes. But Public 
Utilities Commission President Loretta Lynch, a Davis appointee, signaled 
that the administration may be ready to retreat with a plan to hike the 
average retail price by 3 cents a kilowatt hour. That would be a 46 percent 
increase over the current average rate in the PG&E service area of 6.4 cents 
a kilowatt hour, excluding distribution and other costs not directly related 
to power procurement. 
That didn't faze Allan Zaremberg, president of the California Chamber of 
Commerce. "We have looked at it as inevitable for some time," he said of the 
rate hike. Higher natural gas costs, along with the dry winter that reduced 
the availability of hydroelectric power throughout the West, were bound to 
boost retail bills, he said. 
Bradley, speaking for tech manufacturers, said Lynch's plan promises to stem 
the tide of state agency spending on electricity, direct some revenue toward 
small generators and put some downward pressure on wholesale prices but is 
only one step toward a long-term solution. "We need an overall philosophy and 
strategy to restore normalcy to this market," he said. 
Lynch, who described her offering as "merely a proposal to jumpstart the 
public process of rate design," included as a "principle" plans to narrow the 
gap between residential rates and those of industrial users, whose average 
bill now logs in at about 3 cents a kilowatt hour less. Lynch suggested that 
that differential be shaved by about a penny an hour. 
That isn't the direction that Kern would like to see things move. "Our main 
concern would be that if there is a rate increase it be (done) equitably and 
not disproportionately affect business in this region," he said. "We're 
beginning to hear employers say, 'Maybe it's just too costly to do business 
here,'" he warned. 
Higher electricity rates might force price increase and a cutback in 
expansion plans at Helios Farms Nursery in Brentwood, which runs electric 
water pumps for up to eight hours a day during the summer. "It's too soon to 
tell the affect" of the rate increase, said Maria Orfanos, one of the owners. 
"We'll have to see what happens this summer. We need to water the plants." 
But rate hikes promise to remove the cloud of debt -- billions of dollars 
worth -- that now hovers over the utilities. The gap between high wholesale 
prices and fixed retail rates cost PG&E as much as $4.1 billion in after-tax 
profits during 2000, the company said in a securities filing Monday. But that 
didn't seem to bother investors, whose heavy buying made California utilities 
among the stock market's big gainers Monday. PG&E's stock closed at $13.75, 
up $3.10 or 29.1 percent, and Edison International, Southern California's 
largest electricity seller, closed at $14.55, up $3.35 or 29.9 percent. 
Edison issued a late-day response to Lynch's move that seemed designed to 
dampen investors' enthusiasm. "A cursory review of the multiple complex 
proposals suggests that substantial improvements will be needed if they are 
to fully align costs with rates and restore the creditworthiness of the 
state's utilities in the eyes of the financial community," it said. Edison 
also called for the PUC to allow "flexibility to meet unknown future shifts 
in the costs of generation." 
A PG&E spokesman said the company was still analyzing the "inch-thick stack 
of materials" and had no comment. An earlier PUC proposal to require the 
utility to pay small generators would leave the utility with "insufficient 
revenues ... to recover the cost of its own generation" and to pay other 
contracted generators, it said in its filing. 
Kern, the EDAB chief, said he was encouraged by the state's plan to issue 
industrial revenue bonds to finance stand-by generators for businesses and to 
install energy-efficient lighting.

State proposes electric rate hike: PUC suggests 30 percent average increase; 
industry hit hardest 
By Carrie Peyton and Dale Kasler
Bee Staff Writers
(Published March 27, 2001) 
The wildfires sweeping California's electric market burned through to 
consumers' wallets Monday, with a proposal that appeared virtually certain to 
boost overall rates roughly 30 percent. 
Some customers, including households that use little electricity, could be 
spared entirely, while others, including some of the state's biggest 
manufacturers, could see increases of close to 90 percent. 
It would be the biggest rate increase in state history, and there is no 
guarantee it would be enough to resolve California's electricity crisis, 
state-funded ratepayer watchdogs said. 
While Gov. Gray Davis sought to distance himself from the proposal, industry 
observers said it stretched credulity to imagine his appointees to the state 
Public Utilities Commission would have gone against his wishes. 
"Anyone who wants to claim this isn't part of his plan is going to fly in the 
face of everything he's told us. It's just not likely," said Camden Collins, 
a Bay Area energy consultant who has held high-level posts with the PUC and 
the state grid operator. 
After a weekend marathon of last-minute calculations, the PUC issued a 
wide-ranging, sometimes contradictory package of proposals Monday for 
probable commission votes today. 
In one of the biggest conflicts, a PUC administrative judge who oversaw rate 
hearings urged no increase at all, while commission President Loretta Lynch, 
who leads a Davis-picked PUC majority, urged a hike of 3 cents per 
kilowatt-hour. 
Other key proposals include: 
Making permanent a temporary 9 percent - 1 cent per kilowatt-hour - rate hike 
imposed in January for customers of Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern 
California Edison. 
Starting immediate discussions on designing rates that would fall hardest on 
the heaviest users, changes that could appear in May electric bills. 
Revising the formula for paying alternative power producers, known as 
"qualifying facilities," in a way that several said still wouldn't solve a 
simmering payment dispute. 
Creating a formula for utilities to pay the state for electricity purchases 
made on their behalf since January, which appears to clear the way for the 
state to issue power purchase bonds. 
Reclassifying past debts and expenses to sharply cut utilities' estimates of 
their losses - a move sought by consumer groups. 
Consumer groups blasted the proposal, investors welcomed it, and utilities 
were cautious, with PG&E declining immediate comment and Edison saying it 
still didn't go far enough. Generators and economists labeled it a good first 
step. 
"We have unfortunately come to the conclusion that a rate increase is 
needed," Lynch said. "It's time to pay the power bills for California." 
Customers of the Sacramento Municipal Utility District would not be affected, 
although it is considering its own 16 percent rate hike, also driven by 
skyrocketing wholesale costs. 
Lynch's proposal would let PG&E collect an extra $2.3 billion annually from 
customers, increasing PG&E's system average rate from 10.4 to 13.4 cents a 
kilowatt-hour. That comes on top of January's 1-cent average increase, for a 
total rate hike this year of more than 40 percent. 
But individual rates could play out very differently. Some people would 
escape entirely, including those on special low-income rates and residential 
customers whose electricity use falls below a state-set threshold. Companies 
big enough to own their own substations could face hikes of 87 percent; 
agricultural consumers, 10 percent to 24 percent; and other businesses, 41 
percent to 58 percent. 
"Electricity hogs will have to pay more," Lynch said. 
For his part, Davis told reporters in Los Angeles, "As governor, I have not 
decided there should be a rate increase, and as governor, I have not decided 
that tiered pricing makes sense." 
Although Davis has appointed three of the PUC's five commissioners, he said 
"I can't order or direct an independent body." 
Davis' top staff members, however, have been in close communication with the 
commission. Industrial groups indicated the governor's staff was discussing 
nearly identical rate hikes last week. 
Michael Shames, head of the San Diego-based Utility Consumers' Action 
Network, said, "This PUC doesn't do anything of this substance without the 
governor's approval." 
If they pass today, Lynch said, the new rate increases should be enough to 
pay the qualifying facilities and the state for power that is produced or 
purchased from now on. Still unresolved is whether additional rate hikes will 
be needed to cover billions that utilities say they are owed for past 
purchases. 
Several executives of the qualifying facilities said the plan wouldn't pay 
them enough. 
"I don't think it works," said Dean Vanech, president of Delta Power Co., 
which runs five gas-fired cogeneration plants in California. Four have been 
closed because of lack of payment. "We'd lose money marginally on every 
kilowatt we produce," he said. 
Still, many in the private sector saw Lynch's statement as a sign that 
progress was being made. 
Investors drove both utilities' shares up nearly 30 percent. Edison 
International rose $3.35 to $14.55. PG&E Corp. was up $3.10 to $13.75. 
Stephen Levy, senior economist with the Center for Continuing Study of the 
California Economy, said he thinks the state can weather the rate increase. 
"Last year California absorbed a 50 percent increase in the cost of gasoline 
with no appreciable effect," Levy said. 
Although California's economy will slow this year, it will be the result of 
the national malaise and the troubles in the technology sector, not energy 
costs, Levy said. 
But the top increases will hit hard at businesses, including "cement, steel, 
a lot of high tech, anybody in manufacturing," said Carolyn Kehrein, a 
consultant to commercial power users. Some will flee the state, and many 
others will either raise their own prices or cut back on salaries, she said. 
In two hours of testimony before the PUC after the proposals were unveiled, 
utility and consumer lawyers alternately praised and shredded them. 
Noting utilities' last proposal was for a lower increase, Robert Finkelstein, 
attorney for The Utility Reform Network, said, "You're surpassing their 
wildest dreams. That's very, very disturbing." 
The Lynch plan relies heavily on a state bond offering to finance a major 
portion of the Department of Water Resources' electricity purchases. In doing 
so, "we are borrowing against the future to pay the extremely high rates of 
today," said Severin Borenstein of the University of California Energy 
Institute in Berkeley. "We're just paying it on an installment plan instead 
of paying all right now." 
But he said massive, immediate rate hikes could shock California into a 
recession. "We're doing a balancing act," he said.

Cox new minority leader in GOP coup: Assembly conservatives want to flex 
energy muscle 
By Jim Sanders
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published March 27, 2001) 
Assembly Republicans staged a two-hour coup Monday that ended with Sacramento 
County's Dave Cox being named minority floor leader, a move sparked by 
conservatives pushing for a more confrontational approach to the energy 
crisis. 
Cox, of Fair Oaks, vowed to be more "aggressive and proactive" on energy 
issues. He declined to comment on reports that his predecessor, Bill Campbell 
of Villa Park, was dumped in part because he was working too closely with 
Democrats. 
"We don't want to talk about individual personalities," Cox said when asked 
why Campbell was replaced after less than five months in the leadership post. 
"We don't want to sensationalize it. It's a family matter. We'll handle it in 
the family." 
Cox, 63, who is the sixth Assembly Republican leader since late 1995, has 
significant experience in the energy field. He served for four years on the 
Sacramento Municipal Utility District's governing board, and later spent six 
years as a Sacramento County supervisor before joining the Assembly in 1998. 
Under his leadership, Cox said, Republicans will articulate an energy crisis 
"game plan" and specific measures to help generate adequate power supplies by 
2004. 
Although Republicans hold only 29 seats in the 80-member Assembly, Cox said 
that does not mean the party has no control over legislation. 
"You have as much power as you think you have," he said. 
Privately, Assembly Republicans said Cox's selection was driven by a feeling 
that they need to further distance themselves from Gov. Gray Davis' power 
plans and by several key energy-related developments within the past week: 
The Legislature is bracing to vote on separate bills that would provide 
long-term contracts for alternative energy providers and would set the stage 
for California to market billions in bonds to buy electricity in years to 
come. 
Both those votes require a two-thirds majority to take effect immediately, 
meaning that at least five Republicans would have to join with Democrats in 
supporting the measures. Republicans feel that situation gives them leverage, 
and many want a tough leader negotiating on the party's behalf. 
At a party caucus late last week, many Republicans were upset by the 
Democrats' decision to place both key energy issues - and a third that would 
extend an existing rate cap to large San Diego businesses - into a single 
bill, AB 8x. 
Assembly Republicans adamantly opposed that single-bill strategy but were 
placed in an awkward political position - they could either swallow their 
philosophical opposition or vote against the bill and take the blame if 
blackouts resulted. 
As Republicans debated the issue in tense party caucuses, Campbell commented 
that he thought the Democrats' bill would pass. Opponents were livid. He 
later said he did not support AB 8x and was simply providing "cover" for 
colleagues who planned to vote "yes." 
Republicans ultimately voted as a bloc against AB 8x and demanded that all 
three issues be considered in separate bills. Assembly leaders negotiated 
throughout the weekend, but the issues remain unresolved. 
During last week's tense party caucuses, Assemblyman Dennis Mountjoy, 
R-Monrovia, reportedly criticized Campbell for leadership weaknesses. 
Campbell lost his temper, adding momentum to a growing feeling of frustration 
within the caucus, sources said. 
Campbell said Monday that he doubts that the confrontation with Mountjoy 
played a major role in his removal. "That was just a case where things 
happened and I apologized to Dennis. He said, 'It didn't bother me, I have a 
thick skin.' " 
Asked if he had any regrets about his service as Republican leader, Campbell 
said simply that he has enjoyed the post and did his best during the "wild 
ride" of this year's energy crisis. 
"I'd like to still be the leader - but I'm not," he said. 
Republican sources said opposition to Campbell's leadership has been growing 
since January, when he voted to support AB 1x, which committed the state to 
enter the power-buying market in a big way and spend billions for long-term 
energy contracts. 
Campbell, after seeing that he lacked support Monday, decided to step down 
rather than spark a divisive fight to retain the post. Sources said Cox held 
about twice as much support within the caucus as Campbell. 
Ultimately, support from Republican conservatives led by Tony Strickland, 
R-Thousand Oaks, provided the margin of victory for Cox. 
The vote marked a turnabout for Strickland's group, which sided with Campbell 
when he was elected over Cox in November. 
Assemblyman Bill Leonard, R-San Bernardino, said it's too soon to tell 
whether Monday's vote will leave Assembly Republicans deeply divided. 
"It could mean less unity, it could mean more," he said. "It really depends 
on Dave Cox's ability to pull the caucus together." 
GOP political consultant Wayne Johnson said he thinks term limits were a 
factor in the caucus' impatience with Campbell. 
"Everybody knows they're not here for very long, and when you're here during 
what is becoming somewhat of a crisis environment, people want to be a little 
more proactive," Johnson said. 
Ray McNally, a Republican Party consultant, called Campbell an "energy 
casualty." 
Under Cox, he said, Assembly Republicans will be "more aggressive in 
presenting alternatives," and Cox will "work harder to show the differences 
in approaches to solving the energy problem."

Dan Walters: An absolutely incredible tale


(Published March 27, 2001) 
From the onset of his governorship two-plus years ago, Gray Davis has 
insisted, by both public words and private acts, that he and he alone would 
make his administration's major policy decisions. 
Legislators and lobbyists have complained that no one in Davis' office was 
empowered to give an up or down signal on pending legislation, and 
administration officials have recounted grimly - and very privately - tales 
about Davis' insistence on deciding even minuscule policy matters. The 
governor once castigated one of his Cabinet appointees before her colleagues 
in the harshest possible language for making an environmental policy change 
without his approval. The most routine action by a state agency is trumpeted 
through the governor's media office. Davis has even joked about his 
micromanagerial tendencies. 
It is, therefore, utterly incredible - in the precise meaning of the word - 
that Davis' handpicked president of the state Public Utilities Commission, a 
former political adviser, would raise electric power rates by billions of 
dollars without clearing it through Davis. Yet that's what the governor's 
mouthpiece asserts. 
On Monday, PUC President Loretta Lynch - acknowledging what anyone with half 
a brain knew weeks ago - declared that power rates would have to jump 
sharply. She is proposing an increase of three cents a kilowatt-hour, about 
40 percent, in areas served by private utilities to cover the massive costs 
associated with the current crisis, with a "tiered" structure to impose most 
of the burden on high- volume power users. 
Even Lynch was fudging, however, when she insisted that the boost - from 
about seven cents a kilowatt-hour to 10 cents - would be "all that is needed 
going forward." In fact, as anyone who can do simple arithmetic can 
calculate, it's only the beginning of a series of rate jumps that will be 
needed to cover past debts and current wholesale costs. It's not improbable 
that ultimately, rates will double (not counting another nickel a 
kilowatt-hour that's imposed for delivery and other costs). 
Lynch's public statement came just three days after Davis' aides briefed key 
legislators on the likelihood of sharp rate boosts. Throughout, however, 
Davis' spokesmen have insisted that the governor was not supporting such 
increases and continues to believe that the supply and price crunches can be 
handled "within the existing rate structure," as one euphemistic version put 
it. 
The latest spin was issued by Davis' press secretary, Steve Maviglio, after 
Lynch's statement. "The governor has not had conversations with any (utility) 
commissioners about a potential rate hike," the Maviglio statement said. "It 
is still his hope and expectation that this matter can be resolved within the 
existing rate structure." 
Clearly, the governor, who has been so insistent on doing things his way - a 
tendency bordering on obsessive-compulsive behavior - has gone into the 
bunker on this one, allowing Lynch to take the heat from consumer groups, 
which immediately denounced the proposed rate increase as a giveaway to the 
utilities. 
It's cowardly, especially because the current crisis is largely a product of 
dithering by Davis and Lynch last summer when the first price-supply problems 
appeared. Had they acted forthrightly then, with such steps as long-term 
supply contracts, it would have been a relatively minor bump rather than a 
full-blown disaster that threatens the state's business climate and its 
solvency and will cause financial pain for Californians. 
If California needs a utility rate increase, so be it. But we Californians 
would appreciate not being treated like children who need sugarcoating for 
the bad-tasting medicine. And we'd also appreciate not having our 
intelligence insulted with fairy tales from the Governor's Office.

Daniel Weintraub: No crisis is big enough to slow Davis' fund spree 


(Published March 27, 2001) 
If Gov. Gray Davis' potential opponents wanted to invent an anecdote to use 
against him when he runs for re-election next year, they couldn't do any 
better than the one he handed them Friday. 
While lawmakers desperately in need of leadership deadlocked on crucial 
legislation to help solve California's energy crisis, Davis was at a Palm 
Springs country club and golf course, raising money to add to his campaign 
committee's already record-shattering $26 million bank balance. 
The governor's spokesman assures us that Davis did not actually play golf 
Friday. He merely stopped by the fund-raiser because he had some time to kill 
between a morning groundbreaking ceremony and an afternoon television 
interview. 
Right. Davis may have been in Palm Springs on state business, but it's 
curious that, wherever he goes, this governor always seems to find a way to 
raise some money. Even if he didn't play golf, the incident drives home the 
image of a governor so preoccupied with his own re-election that he can't 
stay on-task in Sacramento to work on what is arguably the biggest crisis any 
California politician has ever faced. 
While Davis was rubbing shoulders with wealthy supporters in the desert, his 
staff and some investment bankers were briefing lawmakers on just how bad the 
energy crisis has become. The state may need to borrow $23 billion before 
it's over, the bankers said, not the $10 billion that the governor has 
publicly announced. And the idea of keeping the lights on without further 
rate increases - a mantra to which Davis has clung against all reason - is a 
fantasy. Rates will have to rise, perhaps double, to get us out of this, 
according to the governor's staff. You cannot forever buy a dollar's worth of 
power, they are saying, with 50 cents. 
This is incredible stuff, especially coming from the governor's own people. 
But what's even more astounding is that this news was delivered to the 
Legislature, and thus the public, before Davis himself was fully briefed. 
Davis is not only out of town, it turns out. He's out of touch. Of course, we 
didn't need Friday's fund-raiser to figure that out. 
Last week, to put it mildly, was a bad one for the governor, whom critics 
have begun to call the prince of darkness. It began with two days of rolling 
blackouts that would not have happened but for Davis' inattention to a 
problem that threatened to shut down between 10 percent and 20 percent of the 
state's already short power supply. Alternative energy producers, including 
cogeneration plants that produce electricity as a byproduct of a 
manufacturing operation, were going dark because they weren't getting paid 
for their electricity and could no longer afford to buy the fuel that fires 
their plants. 
It has been widely known for months that the utilities weren't paying these 
power producers. The Legislature has been working on a measure to get them 
paid and lower their rates by roughly half. It's a very important part of any 
comprehensive solution to the crisis. But after the blackouts hit, Davis 
acted as if he'd only just discovered the problem. He was outraged. He said 
it was "immoral" for the utilities to collect money from ratepayers and not 
pay their suppliers. 
But that was only the beginning. The battle over getting the small energy 
producers paid led to questions about how the state would be paid for the 
power purchases Davis has been making since January on behalf of the 
utilities. Davis intends to float a bond measure - public borrowing - to 
reimburse the state's general fund for the $4 billion-plus that the emergency 
buys are costing taxpayers. The bond is supposed to be retired by dedicating 
a share of future electricity rates to repayment. For the transaction to 
work, the bond buyers insist on getting first call on the money collected by 
the utilities. 
The law Davis signed in January when he started buying the power was supposed 
to put the state, and its bond partners, at the front of the line for the 
utilities' cash. But the utilities, particularly Pacific Gas & Electric, 
don't think the law does that. And Davis apparently failed to get their 
signature on an IOU before he put taxpayers on the hook to save the companies 
from bankruptcy. 
These are rather large details to miss for a guy who has a reputation as a 
control freak and a micromanager. But they are part of a pattern stretching 
back to last summer, when Davis brushed off early warnings about the 
potential depths of the crisis he was even then trying to avoid. More and 
more he gives the impression of a man not so much trying to resolve the 
energy crisis but of one who is thinking first, and foremost, about saving 
his own political skin. The problem is, the more he focuses on his own 
prospects, the worse they become. 
It would be nice if Davis would suspend his political money-grubbing for a 
few weeks and work full-time on the business he was elected to do. But then 
again, maybe he should schedule even more fund-raisers: The way things are 
going, come re-election time, he is going to need every penny he can get.

Energy woes give nuclear plants a life 




Crisis offers second chance to all-but-discarded industry
By Bruce Lieberman 
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER 
March 26, 2001 
A group of nuclear power advocates and energy experts gathered in an 
auditorium in Irvine last month to discuss "Nuclear Power: The Option for the 
21st century?" 
Their talk was upbeat. 
Even asking that question would have been laughable five years ago. 
In 1996, California was heading toward a deregulated electricity market. The 
commercial nuclear power industry was heading toward extinction. 
No way could it compete with coal and natural gas fired plants in a 
deregulated market. Never would a utility invest billions of dollars to build 
a nuclear power plant when it had no guarantee of recovering that investment 
through customer rates, which the architects of deregulation said would only 
fall. 
No one had ordered a nuclear power plant in this country since 1978, the year 
before a partial meltdown at the Three Mile Island plant and eight years 
before a nuclear reactor blew up at Chernobyl. 
Political support for nuclear power was all but dead, and electric utilities 
in the United States knew it. 
That was then. 
Today, the country's nuclear power industry is looking at California's 
troubled experiment with electricity deregulation, environmental concerns 
over global warming and an unyielding demand for electricity -- and they see 
one thing: 
Opportunity. 
"I'm extremely optimistic about the future of nuclear power in the U.S.," 
Corbin A. McNeill, Jr., chairman and co-chief executive officer of utility 
giant Exelon Corp., told the Irvine symposium. 
Nuclear power advocates across the country say the industry is safer, more 
efficient and more economically viable than ever before. 
"I personally believe there will be a new generation of nuclear power plants 
in this country," said Ray Golden, a spokesman for Southern California 
Edison's nuclear power plant at San Onofre. "It's a function of when." 
Late last month, Senate Republicans introduced an energy bill that could lead 
to more nuclear power plants. 
The National Energy Security Act, introduced by Sen. Frank Murkowski of 
Alaska, would give a big boost to the industry. It would provide nearly $1 
billion in research and development money, financial rewards for operators 
who make nuclear power plants more efficient, and industrywide tax breaks. 
Critics say the bill would just give taxpayer support to a dying industry. 
"Clamoring for new subsidies doesn't help the industry make the case that it 
is now economically competitive and poised for a resurgence," said 
Christopher Sherry, research director for the Safe Energy Communication 
Council, a coalition of environmental groups founded after the 1979 accident 
at Three Mile Island.
New lease on life
Two primary changes in the nuclear power industry have given advocates reason 
to be optimistic. 
First, commercial power plants have become more efficient. 
The Nuclear Energy Institute, the industry-backed trade association in 
Washington, estimates that improvements in output at the nation's 103 
commercial nuclear reactors have added the equivalent of about 25 1,000 
megawatt-reactors. 
The industry, matured by decades of experience, has improved safety and 
shortened routine shutdowns for refueling and maintenance. Electricity 
production costs are at an all-time low, at 1.83 cents per kilowatt-hour 
(down from 3.12 cents in 1987), making nuclear energy competitive with coal 
and natural gas, according to the institute. 
Second, the federal government has begun extending operating licenses for 
nuclear reactors. 
Since last March, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has extended the 40-year 
operating licenses for five reactors an additional 20 years. The operators of 
five more reactors have applied for license extensions, and an additional 28 
are expected to seek extensions within the next five years, the institute 
said. 
Southern California Edison has not decided whether it will seek a license 
extension for San Onofre's two remaining reactors, Units 2 and 3, Golden 
said. Both are scheduled to be shut down in 2022. 
In those reactors that obtain license extensions, utilities see new value, 
and a profitable future. 
Environmentalists see an avoidable danger. 
Public Citizen, Ralph Nader's consumer advocate group, has called extending a 
nuclear power plant's license a "high-stakes gamble" that risks safety in 
aging plants. 
Critical components in a nuclear power plant, including the reactor pressure 
vessel that holds nuclear fuel and the thousands of steam generator tubes 
that circulate heated and irradiated water, endure extreme stresses and 
degrade over time. 
"There was a reason (the nation's nuclear power plants) originally had 
40-year licenses," said Scott Denman, executive director of the Safe Energy 
Communication Council. 
New sales, new worries
With license extensions, nuclear power plants are now seen by buyers as 
profit centers. Six commercial nuclear reactors have been sold since 
mid-1999, and the sale of eight reactors is pending, according to the Nuclear 
Energy Institute. 
The merger of several big utilities has consolidated ownership of commercial 
nuclear reactors. The marriage of Commonwealth Edison-Unicom in Illinois and 
PECO Energy Co. in Pennsylvania in October created Exelon Corp. and placed 17 
reactors under one corporate roof. 
McNeill, of Exelon, said the consolidation is creating tremendous economies 
of scale that are bringing down operating costs. 
Critics worry about a new rivalry between utilities that operate the plants. 
"Electricity deregulation sets up a direct competition between power plants, 
potentially compromising the safe operation of nuclear power plants as owners 
attempt to minimize operation and maintenance costs while maximizing 
electricity production and sales," Public Citizen has written. 
The environmental group argues that a Feb. 3 electrical fire in the turbine 
room of San Onofre's Unit 3 reactor, which occurred as workers were 
re-starting the reactor after a routine refueling and maintenance outage, 
shows that the industry is not as reliable as advocates would like the public 
to believe. Damage caused by the failed circuit breaker that caused the fire 
will keep the 1,100-megawatt reactor shut down through mid-May. 
"The NRC and the nuclear industry have been skimping on maintenance during 
refueling to improve the profitability of nuclear reactors," said Public 
Citizen's Jim Riccio, senior policy analyst for the group's Critical Mass 
Energy and Environment Program. 
Yet, according to reports the company filed Feb. 16 with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission, Southern California Edison, the majority owner of the 
San Onofre plant, will lose between $80 million and $100 million because of 
the Feb. 3 fire. 
That comes at a rough time for the cash-strapped utility. 
The San Onofre nuclear power plant is the company's most important asset at a 
time when it is near bankruptcy because of skyrocketing electricity costs 
from out-of-state power generators. 
"San Onofre is the only thing that makes the company money," Golden said.
State's nuclear future
California, the most populous state in the country and the world's sixth 
largest economy, has four nuclear reactors -- two at San Onofre and two at 
the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant near San Luis Obispo. Yet, those four 
nuclear reactors generate more than 4,000 megawatts of electricity, nearly 18 
percent of the electricity generated in California. 
A third plant, Rancho Seco, near Sacramento, was shut down in 1989 when 
voters demanded its closure. Opponents said it was badly run. 
Yet, so desperate are state legislators to find sources of power that at 
least one has discussed turning Rancho Seco back on. On Feb. 22, state Sen. 
Tom McClintock, R-Thousand Oaks, introduced a bill to study whether the state 
should buy Rancho Seco. 
McClintock said the plant could be put back into service in nine months for 
$500 million. And, with new turbines, the plant could increase its production 
of electricity from 800 megawatts to 1,100 megawatts -- enough power for more 
than a million people. 
McClintock acknowledges there is little enthusiasm in the state Legislature 
for embracing nuclear energy as one answer to California's energy crisis. 
"Politically, they're scared to death of it," he said. 
John. P. Holdren, a professor of environmental policy at Harvard's John F. 
Kennedy School of Government, said the high cost of building nuclear power 
plants likely will keep the industry from expanding in the short term. 
In the longer term, though, Holdren said nuclear energy could offer a real 
alternative to fossil fuels and thereby help combat global warming. 
In testimony to Congress last June, he outlined several conditions that must 
be met before the nuclear energy production can expand. Among them were some 
high hurdles: 
?The industry must become competitive with other alternative energy sources 
that do not emit carbon into the atmosphere, such as hydro-electric power. 
?Nuclear power plants around the world must prove they are safe. 
?The nation must find a permanent repository for nuclear waste and build 
temporary storage facilities until one opens. 
?Research into reprocessing used nuclear fuel, which produces a form of 
plutonium that could be used in nuclear weapons, should be suspended. 
?Nuclear energy must gain widespread public acceptance. 
New breed 
If any power company debuts the next generation of nuclear power plants in 
the United States, it may very well be Exelon Corp. 
The company is helping to finance research in South Africa into a new type of 
nuclear reactor, called the "pebble bed modular reactor." The 110-megawatt 
reactor, about a tenth the size of conventional nuclear reactors in the 
United States, would be designed to eliminate the risk of a meltdown, backers 
say. 
Passive safety features would eliminate the need for redundant back-up 
systems, containment structures and off-site emergency plants, drastically 
cutting costs. Because of their modular design, additional reactors could be 
added at a single site. McNeill said the new technology could be imported to 
the United States and Europe within the next few years. 
"A typical plant should be able to generate a kilowatt of electricity for 
less than a penny," he said. 
Environmental groups have been extremely critical of the design, saying that 
it needs some type of containment structure, such as the concrete domes at 
San Onofre, to keep radiation from escaping into the atmosphere should 
disaster strike. 
Meanwhile, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has approved three designs for 
other, more conventional reactors. 
McClintock said it's only a matter of time before politicians and the public 
re-think their positions on nuclear energy. 
The legislator predicts that a shift in opinions will come this summer, when 
projections by the California Independent System Operator show that 
electricity supply shortages will force blackouts on 6 million people. 
"By the time the state has survived the summer of 2001," McClintock said, "as 
a practical matter, we'll be forced to take a new look at nuclear energy. 
.?.?. It is going to be a very ugly, ugly awakening for a lot of politicians 
who sat around and did nothing."

Top state power regulator proposes 40 percent rate increase 




By Karen Gaudette
ASSOCIATED PRESS 
March 26, 2001 
SAN FRANCISCO ) California's top power regulator proposed a 40 percent hike 
in electricity rates Monday, saying such an increase should encourage 
customers to cut back on usage and conserve enough power to get through the 
hot summer months. 
Loretta Lynch, president of the Public Utilities Commission, said rates 
should increase by an average of 3 cents per kilowatt hour. The current rate 
averages 7.5 cents per kilowatt hour. 
The higher rates could go into effect as early as Tuesday, when the PUC 
meets. Lynch and two other members of the five-member PUC were appointed by 
Gov. Gray Davis, and Lynch's proposal is expected to be approved by the 
commission. 
Lynch, who repeatedly refused to characterize the hike as a 40 percent 
increase, said the increase was needed to avoid significant power problems 
this summer. 
"That number should be all that is needed going forward," she said at a news 
conference, "to keep utilities solvent and ensure that the treasurer of the 
state can issue bonds." 
Lynch's proposal is at odds with that of administrative law judge Christine 
Walwyn, who recently advised the PUC that rate increases were not necessary. 
Any increase would be on top of the 9 percent to 15 percent rate increase the 
PUC approved in January, and an additional 10 percent increase already 
scheduled for next year. 
Lynch also supports a "tiered" rate system that would charge residential and 
businesses customers more if they're large users and fail to cut back, a move 
aimed at encouraging conservation. 
The governor repeatedly has said he is confident the state's power crisis can 
be resolved without further rate hikes. But Davis aides have concluded that 
rates must rise, given that wholesale power costs remain high. Several 
lawmakers, including Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg, have said a rate 
increase is inevitable. 
"It's obvious to me that unless you rob a bank or win a lottery you are not 
going to be able to do this without raising rates," Senate President Pro Tem 
John Burton, D-San Francisco, said Monday. 
Southern California Edison Co. and Pacific Gas & Electric Co. both have 
pushed for further rate increases, and PG&E has said its current rates would 
be insufficient to cover its bills and the state's. 
Administration officials have been negotiating with PG&E, Edison and San 
Diego Gas & Electric about purchasing the utilities' transmission lines to 
give the companies cash to pay their bills. 
PG&E and Edison say they've lost more than $13 billion since last summer due 
to high wholesale electricity costs that California's 1996 deregulation law 
prevents them from collecting from their customers.

Supplier Duke offers to forego some charges 




By Leslie Gornstein
ASSOCIATED PRESS 
March 26, 2001 
LOS ANGELES ) A North Carolina energy supplier offered Monday to slice nearly 
$20 million off California's emergency power bill for January and February if 
its debtors agree to pay. 
Under increasing pressure from state and federal regulators, Duke Energy 
offered to forego part of what it charged for power during Stage 3 alerts in 
January and February. 
The power went to California's Independent System Operator, which runs 75 
percent of the state's power grid, and to the now-defunct Power Exchange. 
North Carolina-based Duke offered to drop $19.8 million in so-called "credit 
premiums," but only after the two entities agree to pay $273 per megawatt 
hour for power supplied in January and $430 per megawatt hour in February. 
ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson refused to comment on the offer. 
Duke has not been paid for any power sent to California in January and 
February, spokesman Tom Williams said Monday. 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said recently that $273 in January 
and $430 in February were the highest rates that any supplier could charge 
without triggering suspicion of gouging. 
Williams would not say how often Duke's rates exceeded those caps during the 
two months, nor would he say how many megawatt hours Duke sold to California 
during the stretch. 
But he did admit Duke often charged more than those rates. He called the 
additional charges "credit premiums" ) typical fees within the industry. 
Suppliers often charge customers more if they have bad credit or suspect they 
will be unable to pay. 
FERC has said that Duke potentially owes California $21.14 million in 
overcharges for the first two months of the year. 
The company's offer was not meant to be an admission of price gouging, 
Williams said. 
"We have not been paid a dime," Williams said. "It is not unusual to have 
credit premiums." 
Duke, along with Reliant Energy Services, Dynegy Power Marketing Inc., 
Williams Energy Services Corp., Mirant and Portland General Electric, may 
have overcharged California by as much as $125 million in January and 
February, FERC has said. 
Since the state's power crisis erupted, power at times has cost 15 to 20 
times more than it did a year ago. 
Before the energy crisis started, electricity was selling at an average 
wholesale cost of $30 a megawatt hour. 
The crisis stems from 1995 state laws attempting to deregulate the California 
power market. The attempt has been criticized for sinking the utilities, 
trapping them between state-mandated price caps and soaring electricity 
prices on the open market.

PUC to Vote on Big Rate Hike; OK Is Likely 

Electricity: Agency chief urges a boost of about 40% for many, and calls it 
necessary to raise cash and encourage conservation. Higher cost could show up 
in May bills. 

By TIM REITERMAN and NANCY VOGEL, Times Staff Writers 

?????SAN FRANCISCO--Millions of Californians would see electricity rates rise 
by about 40% under a plan presented Monday by the state's top power regulator.
?????Loretta Lynch, president of California's Public Utilities Commission, 
called rate hikes necessary both to raise cash and to encourage conservation.
?????Her plan would charge some customers of the state's two biggest private 
utilities 3 cents more per kilowatt-hour, depending on how much electricity 
they consume. The higher cost would show up in May power bills.
?????Lynch promised to target the increases on heavy users of electricity and 
spare nearly half of residential customers from paying more. The commission 
is scheduled to vote on her proposal today, and it is almost certain to win 
approval, according to commissioners. 
?????It would cost customers of Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & 
Electric a total of $4.8 billion a year. 
?????San Diego Gas & Electric is not covered by the proposed rate hikes, 
though officials there said their utility should be.
?????Nor would the increases affect the customers of municipally owned 
utilities in Los Angeles, Riverside, Pasadena, Anaheim and elsewhere.
?????Lynch's proposal drew fire from consumer advocates, sighs of resignation 
from lawmakers and enthusiasm from Wall Street. Stock prices for both 
companies jumped by nearly one-third.
?????For renters and homeowners, the proposal could cost nothing or as much 
as 40% more per month. Business customers--who now pay lower rates--could see 
even higher increases.
?????The latest proposed increase would come on top of an average 10% rate 
hike for all users imposed in January, which would become permanent under 
Lynch's plan. An additional 10% increase for residential and small business 
users is already scheduled for this time next year.
?????"We recognize the utilities are in severe financial distress," Lynch 
said. "For utilities to keep the lights on, we unfortunately came to the 
conclusion a rate increase was needed."
?????Commissioner Geoffrey Brown, recently appointed by Davis, predicted that 
the plan will pass. Commissioner Richard Bilas, a Republican appointed by 
former Gov. Pete Wilson, would not say whether he would vote for Lynch's 
proposal but said "rates need to go up."
?????Davis, who named three of the five commissioners, distanced himself 
Monday from the PUC action, saying that it's an independent body. He repeated 
that it is his expectation that rate increases can be avoided.
?????"I've not seen enough information to persuade me we need a rate hike," 
the governor said at a news conference after speaking to students at Walt 
Disney Elementary School in Burbank.
?????If the increase is approved today, Lynch said, it will be refined in the 
30 days it takes the utilities to change their billing processes. The rate 
increase would be subject to refund if it is more than enough to cover costs 
of energy purchases.
?????Lynch said she cannot finalize the proposal until she gets more 
information about power supply and cost projections from the California 
Department of Water Resources, which began buying electricity on behalf of 
the nearly bankrupt utilities in mid-January. That's when some generators 
refused to sell to the utilities for fear of not getting paid.

?????Utilities Earned Substantial Profits
?????The utilities have been burdened by wholesale electricity prices that 
have topped 10 times the levels of those a year ago.
?????Rising demand for electricity across the West, plus fundamental flaws in 
the design of the deregulated market that California opened in 1998, have 
allowed sellers of electricity to earn substantial profits. Since the state 
stepped in to buy electricity for the utilities, it has spent about $3 
billion covering roughly 34% of the state's power needs.
?????While Davis has adamantly resisted rate hikes, other politicians have 
come to call increases inevitable. The state and utilities need a better cash 
flow to cover wholesale power costs expected to soar again this summer, they 
say.
?????And rate boosts will serve another critical purpose, they say, by 
prompting Californians to switch off lights, buy efficient refrigerators and 
shut down hot tubs. Such conservation will be crucial in whether the state 
avoids blackouts, grid operators say.
?????"If it is tiered right, it wouldn't break my heart," Senate President 
Pro Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco) said, adding that he expects that any 
increase will exempt low-income people.
?????Lynch said repeatedly that the 3-cent-per-kilowatt-hour hike she 
proposed should be all that is necessary to allow the state and utilities to 
keep buying electricity. The more than $13 billion the utilities claim they 
are owed for power purchases since May must be resolved through negotiations 
between the governor's office and the utilities, she said.
?????The Legislature already has approved a bill guaranteeing that those who 
use 30% more than their minimal allocation, known as the baseline, won't feel 
the hikes.
?????The baseline is a certain amount of electricity--50% to 60% of the 
average residential use per month--that varies regionally, so that a 
homeowner in the desert has a higher baseline amount than one living on the 
temperate coast. Electricity consumed up to the baseline amount costs less.
?????Last year, Edison customers paid 6.2 cents per kilowatt-hour for 
electricity. (The average home uses about 700 to 1,000 kilowatt-hours per 
month.) The PUC raised that rate to 7.2 cents in January, and Lynch's 
proposal would boost it to 10.2 cents.
?????Edison customers also pay an additional 5.25 cents for distribution, 
billing and other costs on top of the electricity charge.
?????Lynch projects that under her plan about half of Edison's households 
would have no monthly bill increases, one-fifth would have an 8% increase, 
and fewer than about one-third of the households would have a 27% increase.
?????Rather than welcome the potential rate hikes, Edison officials said they 
were frustrated that the PUC proposal does not guarantee that the higher 
rates will cover all of the utility's and the state's costs.
?????"It helps, but it doesn't solve the problem," said John R. Fielder, a 
senior vice president at Edison. "And it's really vulnerable because if it's 
not enough, then what do you do?"
?????Fielder pointed out that when Edison argued for higher rates in 
December, it was turned down, causing the utility to accumulate additional 
billions in debt. Monday's PUC proposal treats that debt as a "stranded 
cost," which the utility could eventually be expected to absorb, he said.
?????In a two-hour hearing on Lynch's proposal, PG&E lawyer Chris Warner 
called it a "a step in the right direction."
?????"We agree with President Lynch that it's time to pay the power bills," 
he said. Warner declined to elaborate until the utility could study the 
proposal further.
?????Consumer groups immediately attacked the rate hike proposal.
?????Jason Zeller, an attorney with the PUC's independent Office of Ratepayer 
Advocates, complained that "customers had no notice that they would be socked 
with the largest rate increase in California history."
?????"My big concern . . . is it imposes massive increases, damages the 
economy, and there is no guarantee it would do any good," Zeller said.
?????Bob Finkelstein of the Utility Reform Network said: "The focus [of the 
PUC] should be to bring prices down, not rates up."
?????Power sellers in California's market have "an uncanny ability to sniff 
out money," Finkelstein said, and the Lynch proposal "only puts more on the 
table."
?????Lynch blamed the need for rate hikes on exorbitant prices for wholesale 
electricity, noting that California paid $7.4 billion for electricity in all 
of 1999, and $5.2 billion last January. She also blamed the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission for failing to impose a cap on wholesale electricity 
prices in California, despite its mandate under federal law to assure 
citizens of "just and reasonable" prices.
?????To plug the $3-billion hole in the state budget and pay for power in 
coming months, lawmakers in February passed a law to sell roughly $10 billion 
in revenue bonds. The bonds would be paid back with money collected by the 
utilities from their customers.
?????In recent weeks the utilities have argued that little or nothing is left 
over after they subtract their own costs of producing and distributing power 
from what they collect from monthly bills.
?????But on Monday, Lynch issued a draft decision that would force the 
utilities to send ratepayer revenue to the state based on a formula set by 
the PUC.
?????Representatives of both PG&E and Edison criticized that proposal at 
Monday's hearing, saying it gave priority to the state Department of Water 
Resources.
?????Lynch also proposed forcing the utilities to begin paying hundreds of 
small energy producers. Some of those renewable and alternative power 
generators have not been paid since November. Many have shut down, and their 
lost output contributed to rotating blackouts last week.
?????The potential rate hikes were seen as lessening the possibility of 
utility bankruptcy. That sent investors diving into the stocks of Edison 
International, parent of Southern California Edison, and PG&E Corp, parent of 
Pacific Gas & Electric Co.
?????Edison rocketed $3.35, or 30%, to $14.55 while PG&E shares leaped $3.10, 
or 29%, to $13.75. Both stocks have lost considerable value in recent weeks 
as the electricity crisis dragged on with no solution.
?????Investors were not discouraged by PG&E's warning that it might take a 
$4.1-billion after-tax charge against 2000 earnings if it concludes that it 
will not be able to collect its electricity debts through rates. Edison last 
week said it might take a $2.7-billion after-tax charge when earnings are 
posted, no later than April 15.

Davis Ducks Reality on Electricity 'Overcharges' 
By BENJAMIN ZYCHER AND, GARY B. ACKERMAN


?????As temperatures rise and the lights go out, let us recall the blessed 
memory of Marx. Not Karl. Groucho. Well, not Groucho exactly, but instead the 
other star of "You Bet Your Life," his duck, which would descend from the 
heavens with a cigar and a crisp $100 bill upon hearing a contestant utter 
the secret word of the day. 
?????For Gov. Gray Davis, the magic word is "votes," and he wants to offer 
$100 bills to everyone, courtesy of the electric power sector. Davis will 
discover during the long, hot summer that it won't work. While he and the 
Legislature and the Public Utilities Commission and the Electricity Oversight 
Board have had a grand time chasing each other around a room with whipped 
cream pies and seltzer bottles, the economic and political risks faced by 
producers have grown, the state budget reserve largely has gone poof! and 
efforts both rhetorical and political to force other Western states to bail 
California out predictably have come a cropper. 
?????And so the buck-passing season is in full bloom. Accordingly, we now 
have studies from the Independent System Operator--the board of which was 
appointed by Davis--purporting to show that recent prices charged by power 
producers have exceeded costs, and thus have been unreasonable to the tune of 
$6.3 billion, concluding that the current mess is all their fault, and that 
everyone should get big refunds. 
?????Well. It all depends on what your definition of "cost" is. The ISO 
analysis ignores the risks of nonpayment, now very real in the California 
market, to the tune of $14 billion owed by the utilities, largely to power 
producers and traders. The interest costs on late payment are ignored. The 
ISO shunts aside the risks of unplanned outages of generating equipment, 
necessitating the purchase of power in volatile spot markets. It ignores the 
market value of investment in reliability, the political risks of 
after-the-fact changes in the rules of the game, the risks posed by the 
lawsuit industry, the risks of transmission breakdowns, the risks of rising 
prices for natural gas and on and on. That a number of important costs faced 
by power producers do not show up on the books does not mean that they are 
not real. 
?????More fundamentally, the mere fact that prices are high does not 
demonstrate that the market is noncompetitive. It is not costs that determine 
prices in competitive markets, it is the relationship between cost and demand 
conditions. Suppose sudden bad weather destroys a substantial part of the 
wheat crop. The price of wheat will rise, despite the fact that costs as 
measured by the accountants--the price of fuel and other inputs--will not 
have increased at all. 
?????The ISO and others attempt to circumvent this simple reality by offering 
exotic theories of market manipulation, in which producers withhold 
electricity to drive prices up. This old argument fails to answer the crucial 
question of which producer will withhold production. Each producer prefers 
that his competitors withhold so that he can receive the benefits of higher 
prices. An assumption that producers will take turns is not very helpful, 
because their respective interests and expectations of future market 
conditions are likely to differ. And anyway, where is the evidence? 
?????And so we are left with a call for regional price controls. Do 
bureaucrats never learn? Price controls raise true prices, they exacerbate 
demand/supply imbalances, and yet are beloved of politicians whose time 
horizons extend only to the next election. The rest of us, unfortunately, 
must live with the longer-term effects. Can anyone believe that confiscating 
billions of dollars from the private sector will increase long-term 
investment in electric generating capacity? 
?????The reality is that for nine months Davis has dallied, dithered and 
engaged in demagoguery. Scapegoating now is the order of the day, as it sinks 
in that no amount of talk will pull an electric rabbit out of a hat. It was 
obvious last year that this problem largely would have been solved with a 
moderate increase in electricity rates, combined with some straightforward 
changes in regulatory policies. 
?????It is true that Davis did not create this problem, although his attempts 
to blame prior Republican officials conveniently ignore the fact that the 
Democrats held the Legislature when the current system was enacted. Oops. In 
any event, it matters not one whit: We elect public leaders to lead when 
unexpected problems arise. 
?????It would be nice if Davis were simply to level with Californians: There 
is no painless route out of this mess, attempts to make scapegoats of the 
producers are dishonest and destructive, and our regulatory system is 
dysfunctional. Actually, that would be more than merely nice; it would be 
uplifting.

PG&E Bills Set to Rise 40% 
TIERED RATES: PUC meets today, expected to enact system penalizing heavy 
users David Lazarus, Chronicle Staff Writer
Tuesday, March 27, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle 
URL: 
http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/03/27/M
N102966.DTL 

Undermining Gov. Gray Davis' pledge that electricity bills will not go up, 
state regulators yesterday proposed an across-the-board 40 percent rate 
increase as part of a series of measures to remedy California's energy 
crisis. 
The immediate rate increase, to be voted on today by the Public Utilities 
Commission, includes a new 30 percent increase and makes permanent a 
"temporary" 10 percent average increase approved in January. 
However, heavier electricity users would end up paying more than lighter 
users under a so-called tiered system that could be enacted by May, PUC 
President Loretta Lynch said. 
"It's time to pay the power bills for California," she said. "We have 
unfortunately come to the conclusion that a rate increase is needed." 
Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for the governor, insisted that Davis played no 
role in the decision to raise consumers' rates. 
"He has not signed off on this," Maviglio said. "The PUC is an independent 
body. It does what it wants." 
However, Maviglio acknowledged that the PUC is controlled by Davis' 
appointees and that the governor's staff was briefed in advance of 
yesterday's announcement. 
Lynch said she does not expect further rate increases this year. But she also 
said the situation could change depending on current bailout negotiations 
between the governor and near-bankrupt utilities as well as the state's 
ability to recoup costs from its multibillion-dollar power purchases. 
Harry Snyder, senior advocate for Consumers Union in San Francisco, said 
there is no way state officials can avoid additional rate increases after 
confronting sky-high electricity prices this summer. 
"It's a disaster," he said. "By the end of summer, rates will go up by 100 
percent. They have to because these new increases will barely pay back the 
state for its power purchases." 
Snyder also criticized the governor for having insisted that consumers would 
not be saddled with paying the tab for the bungled deregulation of 
California's power market. 
Davis has said repeatedly in recent weeks that rates would not need to rise 
beyond "the existing rate structure," which many observers took to mean 
January's 10 percent increase plus an additional 10 percent increase next 
year. 
"It's the Nixon, trust-me school of government," Snyder said. "How can we 
take the governor at his word?" 
Because Lynch and other Democratic appointees hold a majority on the five- 
member PUC, passage of the rate increase today is all but assured. 
However, Lynch said consumers probably would not see the change reflected in 
their bills until a tiered rate system can be introduced within 45 days. 
Under that system, according to PUC figures, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. 
customers who are light power users would see no change from current average 
electricity bills of $60. 
Medium users -- those who stay within 200 percent of pre-established limits 
-- would see average bills rise by 9 percent to about $65. Heavy users would 
see average bills jump by 36 percent to around $132. 
Rate increases for customers of Southern California Edison would range from 8 
percent for medium users to 27 percent for heavy users. 
These increases would be on top of January's rate increases, which ranged 
from 9 percent for residential customers to 15 percent for large industrial 
users. 
Investors saw this as manna from heaven for California's cash-strapped 
utilities. PG&E's stock soared 29 percent yesterday to $13.75, while Edison's 
shares climbed 30 percent $14.55. 
The increase would generate about $2.5 billion a year for PG&E and $2.3 
billion for Edison. 
Yet many uncertainties remain. For example, the rate increase would not 
affect about $13 billion in debt racked up by the utilities as a result of 
runaway wholesale power prices. 
That issue will be left for the governor to tackle in his bailout talks. 
Maviglio, Davis' spokesman, said yesterday that the negotiations are making 
progress, but he could not say whether a deal at last is taking shape. 
ALTERNATIVE ENERGY PLANTS
Another wild card is the matter of alternative-energy providers, which have 
cut back production in recent days because they no longer can pay their 
natural gas bills. 
The companies -- known as "qualifying facilities" or "QFs" in industry 
parlance -- say they are owed millions of dollars by PG&E and Edison. 
The PUC will vote today on forcing the utilities to pay the alternative 
energy providers for all power received, but only on a forward-looking basis. 
Past debt would not have to be paid right away. 
It remains to be seen whether the qualifying facilities, half of which were 
shut down during last week's blackouts, will be able to resume operations. 
"We cannot direct the gas suppliers to sell to them," admitted PUC member 
Carl Wood. 
The commission also is expected to vote today on requiring PG&E and Edison to 
repay about $4 billion paid by the state Department of Water Resources to 
purchase electricity for the utilities' customers. 
However, it is not yet clear how revenue from ratepayers will be divvied up 
in the future. The utilities and the Department of Water Resources are at 
odds over which would get first crack at the funds to cover expenses. 
BLAME GOES TO PROFITEERS
Lynch, the PUC president, laid blame for California's troubles on profit- 
hungry power companies that she said have gouged the state's consumers, as 
well as on a reluctance among federal regulators to limit how much generators 
can charge for electricity. 
"The federal market cops need to get back on the beat because they're nowhere 
to be found," she said. 
A spokeswoman for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in Washington, D. 
C., declined to comment. 
Nettie Hoge, executive director of The Utility Reform Network in San 
Francisco, questioned the wisdom of raising consumers' rates as long as 
wholesale prices remain unchecked, especially going into a summer of expected 
shortages. 
"Neither the commission nor the governor are willing to say no to the cartel 
that is gouging us and extracting obscene profits," she said. "Every time we 
put a burden on ratepayers and ask them to dig deeper in their pockets, 
the cartel smells money and moves in for the kill." 
Lynch stressed that the burden on ratepayers would be eased under a tiered 
system that she said would promote conservation. 
'HOGS' WILL BE SLAUGHTERED 
"Electricity hogs will need to pay more," she said. "If you want to run your 
pool pump during peak hours this summer, you will pay for that." 
Tiered rates have found support virtually across the spectrum, from the 
governor's office to consumer watchdogs. The PUC is expected to have no 
difficulty adopting such a system. 
But Snyder at Consumers Union took issue with Lynch's characterization of 
higher rates as a conservation tool. 
"That's total bull," he said. "She's just trying to rationalize the increase 
by saying it's all the consumer's fault. 
"The governor said there would be a sharing of pain," Snyder added. "This 
isn't sharing. This is nothing but pain for consumers." 
The Agenda 
Regulators will vote today on: 
-- Immediately raising electricity rates 30 percent and making permanent a 
"temporary" 10 percent rate increase adopted in January. 
-- Forcing utilities to pay smaller power companies for their output. Half of 
such generators were shut down during last week's blackouts because they 
could not afford fuel. 
-- Requiring utilities to reimburse the state Department of Water Resources 
for $4 billion in power purchased on behalf of utility customers.

Governor's Static Cling May Cost Him Politically 
Davis acts stunned at PUC's proposed rise in energy rates

N129191.DTL 
Sacramento -- Gov. Gray Davis clung yesterday to his expectation that energy 
rates won't have to go up and insisted that he didn't know one of his top 
political appointees would propose a 40 percent increase. 
Those comments drew shaking heads from many lawmakers, both Republicans and 
Democrats, who believe that the governor was an active participant in the 
plan announced by the head of the Public Utilities Commission. 
"I don't believe it," said Sen. Jackie Speier, D-Hillsborough. "I think the 
governor has been real clear from day one how he views everyone else in state 
government. He certainly believes his appointees should reflect his vision. 
I'd be very surprised if he isn't communicating. And if he isn't, he should 
be. " 
Political observers say Davis may have thought he had found a political out 
by having the commission -- which is accustomed to making unpopular decisions 
- - take the lead on raising rates. 
But the strategy could backfire as lawmakers from both parties say the 
governor's refusal to acknowledge the necessity of rate increases -- a 
position held by even his top advisers -- is making the energy crisis worse. 
Pollster Mark DiCamillo of the Field Institute said Davis is making a 
political calculation by keeping to his word on not needing rate increases. 
"I think it may be a public posture he wants to consistently maintain -- he 
may not prevail -- but they may have to drag him kicking and screaming to 
raise rates," DiCamillo said. "But if his will is not carrying the day, he 
may be seen as powerless and that could drag him down." 
While PUC chairwoman Loretta Lynch announced that that rates will probably go 
up 40 percent, Davis stayed far away from the firestorm enveloping the 
Capitol, instead handing out academic performance bonuses at a school in 
Southern California. 
The governor has often tried to have it both ways with the PUC. Last week he 
held a press conference to say he was going to direct the commission to act 
on a plan to bail out alternative power generators. Yet yesterday a spokesman 
insisted Davis knew nothing of Lynch's plans to propose a tiered rate 
increase. 
Davis has appointed three members of the PUC, giving his members a majority 
on the five-member board. 
But this isn't the first time Davis has tried to shy away from PUC decisions. 
In December, when he had appointed just two members, he said, "It doesn't 
matter what I think. The PUC is the legal body that will make a determination 
as to what, if any, rate increase is appropriate." 
Assembly Republican leader Dave Cox of Fair Oaks, elected to his new 
leadership role just yesterday, said Davis cannot run away from this rate 
increase. 
"My guess is he has everything to do with it," Cox said. "My guess is Ms. 
Lynch at the PUC doesn't work independently of the governor." 
But sources in the governor's office insisted that the governor had no 
knowledge of Lynch's press conference. In fact, they said the governor was 
frustrated by not knowing the announcement was coming. 
Lawmakers could only shrug yesterday when told that the governor yesterday 
said in written comments that it is his "hope and expectation that this 
matter can be resolved within the existing rate structure." 
Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, the lower house's point man on the 
energy crisis, called Davis' attempts to keep rates stable "noble." 
"We are now past the time of pursuing noble goals -- we're at a time when it 
is important to problem solve," he said. "One of the tools absolutely 
necessary to solve this problem is to raise rates. I don't like it, I don't 
think there is anybody who does. But to continue now to maintain the fiction 
that rates don't have to go up, will cause rates to go up more when they do 
go up and will make it take longer to solve the problem." 
Speier said she believes the problem is "spiraling out of control." 
"It is a time to take bold steps, such as seizing assets," she said. "This is 
how leadership is tested." 
Davis has taken pride in being cautious, but in an emergency that lack of 
decisiveness could be his downfall. 
"As this goes on and the treasury is barren, he is going to be attacked for 
other reasons," DiCamillo said. "As other things get cut from the budget, 
this will loom in the backdrop." 
One advantage for Davis is that the PUC has often been a scapegoat for 
unpopular regulatory decisions, DiCamillo said. 
But on a day when Secretary of State Bill Jones became the first Republican 
to announce that he will oppose Davis in 2002, GOP lawmakers grew bolder in 
their criticism. 
"Regretably, I don't think the governor even today understands the magnitude 
of the problem," Cox said. "The governor has to be engaged." 
Assemblyman Bill Leonard, R-San Bernardino, said ratepayers will be faced 
with a "Davis price surcharge." 
"The indecision, the lack of a plan for the last four months has resulted in 
increased costs that have to be laid at the governor's door," he said. 
Energy Crisis Jolting Sacramento What Gov. Gray Davis has said this year 
about the possibility of rate increases: . After a plan for the state to 
purchase electricity directly from power generators and sell it at cost to 
cash-strapped utilities: 
JAN. 14 -- "There will be no rate increases." 
After announcing that California would begin signing long-term contracts with 
power generators at prices lower than those available on the open market: 
FEB. 2 -- "This will allow us to enter into and sign long-term contracts that 
I believe will allow us to resolve our energy challenge without raising 
rates." 
FEB. 3 -- "I believe we can get through this without the need for raising 
rates," he said. "But it's going to take a very substantial effort on the 
part of every citizen. They will have to consume considerably less energy 
than they did last summer. My office is so dark you can nearly develop film 
in it." 
FEB. 17 -- "Believe me, if I wanted to raise rates I could have solved this 
problem in 20 minutes. . . . It is my plan that all this can be done in the 
existing rate structure." 
FEB. 27 -- "I have been telling people I think we are on the back side of the 
crisis."

Pleas for Warning Of Next Blackout 
ISO to address customers' biggest gripe about outages 
Chuck Squatriglia, Chronicle Staff Writer
Monday, March 26, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle

N160850.DTL 
Under intense public pressure, state power regulators will try to solve a 
widespread complaint about the rolling blackouts plaguing California: how to 
warn people that the lights are about to go out. 
One of the biggest gripes people have about the outages is getting no advance 
warning of outages that render everything plugged into a wall socket utterly 
useless. 
While many people say they understand blackouts are, for now, a fact of life, 
they also want to know when the next one will roll through their 
neighborhood. 
Jillian Hom, an employee at a San Francisco branch of Baskin Robbins, said it 
would sure come in handy to get advance notice of a power outage -- 
especially in the ice cream business. 
"It would give us time to cover up all the flavors of ice cream so they would 
stay colder longer" she said. "It would also give us time to prepare because 
we're not supposed to stay open during a blackout." 
Although the utilities pull the plug, the decision to start a rolling 
blackout is made in Folsom by the Independent System Operator, which manages 
the state's massive power grid. The outages begin whenever California's 
electricity reserves dip below 1.5 percent, threatening to bring the grid 
crashing down. 
ISO board member Carl Guardino thinks it might be time for the agency and the 
utilities to begin warning people before cutting the juice. He plans to raise 
the issue during Friday's board meeting. 
Guardino could not be reached for comment but purportedly wants to balance 
protecting the grid with allowing people to prepare for a blackout. 
"He understands the situation the ISO is in, and he understands that PG&E is 
doing the best that it can," said Michelle Montague-Bruno, spokeswoman for 
the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group -- which Guardino leads. "He's 
completely sympathetic to everything everyone is dealing with. But he also 
thinks we have to do something to improve the system." 
The inconvenience of a sudden outage goes far beyond missing your favorite 
soap opera or even having the ice cream melt. Businesses lose money. 
Researchers working with radioactive, infectious or corrosive materials face 
grave risks. High-tech firms spend hours or even days recalibrating 
equipment. The list goes on. 
These hassles could be minimized, if not avoided, if PG&E would tell people 
when and where the outages will strike, Montague-Bruno said. 
"The more warning they can give, the more we can prepare," she said. 
Although the outages often come out of the blue, PG&E's 4.8 million customers 
have a vague idea of when it's their turn in the rotation. 
Customers are assigned to one of 14 blocks, and power is cut to each block 
sequentially. Customers can determine which block they're in by looking at 
the lower left corner of their bill. 
"If you're in block 14 and we're (cutting power) in block 4, you know you can 
breathe fairly easily," said utility spokesman Scott Blakey. "But if you're 
in block 5, you know you can expect an outage." 
But the blocks cover vast swatches of the state, and power can be cut to a 
portion of each block. That leaves critics complaining that block numbers are 
all but meaningless. 
Brandie Spencer, a shift manager at the Pasta Pomodoro chain in Berkeley, 
said the restaurant's accounting department deals with the power bills so she 
has no clue what her block number is. 
"I have no idea when they plan to pull the plug on us," she said. "But I do 
know that it will be bad if it comes as a surprise in the middle of a busy 
day. 
We don't have back-up generators, so food orders won't be able to be filled, 
cash registers won't work and I can't very well send customers home." 
PG&E argues providing more specific information could jeopardize public 
safety. It claims criminals would know which neighborhoods and businesses 
aren't protected by burglar alarms, security cameras and the like. 
But authorities in Palo Alto and Alameda -- two cities with municipal 
utilities that actively tell customers where the next outage will strike and 
roughly when it's coming -- haven't found any evidence supporting that view. 
"I can't think of a major increase in crime during the blackouts," said Agent 
Jim Coffman, spokesman for the Palo Alto Police Department. 
Others note that outages typically come during daylight hours, when criminals 
are less likely to strike, or early in the evening, when most folks are home. 
PG&E also argues there isn't time to alert millions of people to rolling 
blackouts, which often start with just a few minutes notice from the ISO. 
"We often do not have any lead time," Blakey said. "The last time we had 
outages, (the ISO) lost two power plants just like that. Bing, bang, boom and 
we were in the middle of a Stage 3 alert." 
Municipal utilities also have a fraction of the customers that PG&E does, 
which makes it far easier for them to notify people, Blakey said. 
"We have an average of 225,000 people in each block," he said. 
That's about 10 times as many people as the Palo Alto Utility Department 
serves. But municipal utilities said notifying customers isn't particularly 
difficult -- or costly -- thanks to the Internet. 
Alameda Power and Telecom spent about $20,000 creating a system using a 
telephone hot line, e-mails and faxes to provide information to its 32,000 
customers, said utility spokesman Matt McCabe. The information is available 
within minutes of an ISO call for outages, he said. 
"It wasn't a tremendous expenditure of money, but it has been a lot of time, 
" McCabe said. "But Alamedans have a very high expectation, and rightfully 
so, that we should keep them apprised of the power situation. That's an 
obligation that we have."

PUC set to give up on rate freeze; increases up to 36% likely 
Posted at 11:29 p.m. PST Monday, March 26, 2001 
BY VBY JOHN WOOLFOLK 

vMercury News 


State regulators today are poised to deliver consumers a jolt by boosting 
residential electric bills as much as 36 percent or $47 a month. 
The California Public Utilities Commission's proposed rate increase comes on 
top of a 9 percent ``temporary'' increase approved in January and despite 
Gov. Gray Davis' promises to solve the state's crisis without higher rates. 
Regulators plan to make that 9 percent increase permanent as well. The higher 
rates would take effect immediately upon expected approval at today's meeting 
and would appear on bills beginning in May. 
``We have unfortunately come to the conclusion that a rate increase is 
needed,'' said Loretta Lynch, the commission's president. ``It's time to pay 
the power bills for California.'' 
Under the tiered-rate proposal, more than half of residential customers would 
see their bills jump by $6 to $47 a month. But energy misers and the poor 
won't see any increase. 
Industrial customers, who historically enjoyed lower rates than homeowners, 
would see their bills soar more than 40 percent. Commercial customers would 
pay 22 percent more than they do now. 
Lynch described the plan as a way to encourage conservation and help avoid 
blackouts this summer. 
``Electricity hogs will need to pay more for the energy they use this 
summer,'' she said. 
Davis, who appointed a majority of the utilities commissioners, including 
Lynch, was said to be fuming over Monday's announcement. 
``It is still his hope and expectation that this matter can be resolved 
within the existing rate structure,'' Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said. 
Consumer advocates blasted the increase as a betrayal. 
``It's obviously a huge disappointment for consumers,'' said Robert 
Finkelstein, an attorney for The Utility Reform Network. 
``Up to this time, the Davis administration and the PUC, in particular, had 
made encouraging noises about getting the money out of the generators,'' 
Finkelstein said, referring to private companies charging high wholesale 
rates for power. ``This draft decision seems to be an abandonment of that 
position in favor of taking it out of the consumers' hides.'' 
But most state lawmakers have abandoned hope of avoiding higher consumer 
rates. In recent weeks, they've seen negotiations to prop up the foundering 
utilities stall and the administration's efforts to secure low-cost power 
contracts fall far short of expectations. 
Meanwhile, the state has been spending more than $1 billion a month buying 
power for the major utilities, mostly on short-term markets, where prices 
have risen eightfold. 
``I don't think anybody is fooled about the inevitability of a rate 
increase,'' said Assemblywoman Carole Migden, D-San Francisco. 
Assembly Speaker pro tem Fred Keeley, D-Santa Cruz, a central figure in the 
state's efforts to resolve the crisis, called Davis' rate-increase resistance 
a noble but unrealistic goal. 
``We are now past the time of pursuing noble goals,'' Keeley said. ``We are 
at a time where it is important to problem-solve.'' 
Commissioners, who hastily drafted the rate increase over the weekend, said 
it was needed to keep the major utilities from sinking into bankruptcy, which 
they fear could unravel the state's electric system. Pacific Gas & Electric 
Co. and Southern California Edison have been nearly bankrupted by soaring 
wholesale power costs that aren't covered by their state-frozen rates. 
Officials at PG&E and Southern California Edison were combing through the 
PUC's rate-increase proposal Monday. PG&E declined to comment. 
Commissioners blamed the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for failing to 
rein in wholesale power costs with price caps despite mounting evidence that 
independent energy companies are gouging California consumers. 
U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said a rate rise could ease approval of 
legislation she is carrying that would force federal regulators to enact a 
regional price cap. 
``There has been some resistance by members of Congress who feel the people 
of California have not fully faced up to the energy crisis,'' said Feinstein 
spokesman Howard Gantman. 
The proposed rate increase of 3 cents per kilowatt-hour, along with the 
1-cent increase in January, would push California residential rates over 15 
cents, among the highest in the nation. 
Rates will be based on how much electricity customers use. Power-pinching 
residential consumers who use no more than 130 percent of their ``baseline'' 
allotment, an amount based on regional climate, would see no further rate 
increase at all. Poor customers who qualify for rate assistance also would be 
exempted. 
But PG&E residential customers who exceed 130 percent of the baseline -- 
currently more than half -- would see their bills rise 9 to 36 percent. 
State regulators said they needed to quickly boost the utilities' revenues 
with higher rates to keep small energy producers from cutting off supplies. 
Another concern was that the utilities haven't paid the California Department 
of Water Resources for the power it has been buying since January for their 
customers, draining billions from the state's general fund. 
In approving the rate increase, regulators plan to order the utilities to pay 
the small generators and the state for their ongoing power costs, and to 
reimburse the state for its past purchases. 
PG&E and Edison have received some $400 million in additional revenue from 
the earlier rate increase and now have more than $4 billion in the bank, 
regulators said. 
Even so, regulators say utilities still face a cash-flow problem. The new 
increase will add $4.8 billion to their annual revenues. 
The commission, however, is ordering the utilities only to pay power 
companies for ongoing costs. It does not address the $1.5 billion owed to the 
small generators or the billions in debt to large power suppliers. 
Lynch said no further rate increase should be necessary, and that consumers 
could be refunded if investigations show they've been overcharged.

Gov. Davis' hard line against higher rates is fuel for challengers 
Posted at 10:44 p.m. PST Monday, March 26, 2001 
BY DION NISSENBAUM AND HALLYE JORDAN 

Mercury News Sacramento Bureau 


SACRAMENTO -- The political sharks are starting to circle Gov. Gray Davis as 
the state's energy crisis threatens to drain the average Californian's 
wallet. 
With energy regulators -- most of them Davis appointees -- preparing today to 
raise rates, opponents on his left and right are beginning to smell blood, 
raising their hopes of making Davis the first one-term California governor in 
more than 50 years. 
Republican Secretary of State Bill Jones, sounding what is expected to be a 
key theme, announced his long-expected plan Monday to challenge the 
Democratic governor next year by accusing Davis of putting ``his head in the 
sand'' during the energy crisis. 
Consumer groups are vowing a ``ratepayer revolt'' and ballot measure that 
could batter Davis during his re-election campaign. 
And Davis is facing the growing possibility that a member of his own party 
may view the governor as vulnerable enough to challenge him for the 
Democratic nomination. 
``The political danger is in rates,'' said Mark DiCamillo, director of the 
non-partisan Field Institute. ``That's when the political punch hits. 
``If the rates rise and the governor hasn't been able to hold them back, his 
standing would start to crumble.'' 
For weeks, Davis has been expressing his ``hope and expectation'' that energy 
bills wouldn't need to rise more than the 20 percent that's already been 
approved. He has sought to portray himself as a staunch defender of the 
average Californian. 
Once again, Monday, even as his own political appointees to the Public 
Utilities Commission were proposing immediate and stunning rate hikes, Davis 
again expressed his ``hope and expectation'' that such a move would not be 
necessary. 
But as the crisis appears to worsen, there seem to be few people left, 
including those on governor's own staff, who believe the problems can be 
solved without asking Californians to pay more -- dramatically more -- for 
power. 
In some ways, Davis has painted himself into a corner much the way President 
Bush hurt his 1992 re-election chances by breaking his ``no new taxes'' 
pledge. 
Two options for Davis 
Davis faces two options: oppose rate increases that nearly everyone else sees 
as inevitable and take continuing hits for failing to lead, or reverse course 
and face criticism for abandoning his longstanding opposition. 
Either choice could hurt his political prospects -- both for governor and as 
a potential presidential candidate in 2004. 
In the Capitol, some lawmakers, Democrats included, are becoming increasingly 
frustrated at his refusal to talk about raising rates and have begun to raise 
questions about his leadership. 
Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Santa Cruz, called the governor's stand against 
rate increases ``a noble goal,'' but added, ``We are now past the time of 
pursuing noble goals.'' 
``One of the tools that will be absolutely necessary to solve this problem is 
to raise rates,'' said Keeley, one of the Legislature's key energy 
negotiators. ``To continue now to maintain the fiction that rates don't have 
to go up will cause rates to go up more when they go up and will take longer 
to solve the problem.'' 
Another senior Democratic lawmaker likened the governor's position to 
President Lyndon B. Johnson during the Vietnam War when the violent morass 
engulfed his administration, created a national crisis and pressured him to 
abandon his 1968 re-election bid. 
``There will inevitably be people surfacing who will challenge the governor 
from within the party,'' the lawmaker said. 
Jones to challenge Davis 
On Monday, Secretary of State Jones -- the only Republican in statewide 
office -- said he would challenge Davis next year and used the energy crisis 
as his major hammer. 
Jones told reporters in Sacramento that Davis turned a blind eye to 
skyrocketing energy costs in San Diego last summer, an early warning that 
could have helped the state avert the electrical mess. 
``Instead, the governor chose not to have a bold, aggressive plan,'' Jones 
said. ``He chose to basically put his head in the sand, and hope that the 
problem would go away.'' 
But Davis still holds some commanding advantages. He has raised an 
intimidating $26 million for his re-election campaign -- compared with 
$118,000 for Jones. And he continues to receive strong support from 
Californians in polls. 
``I think that one of the reasons that the governor's public standing has 
remained favorable is because the average person out there clearly 
understands that he has been fighting the good fight on behalf of 
ratepayers,'' said Garry South, the governor's chief political consultant. 
Even so, more and more lawmakers are urging Davis to take more decisive steps 
to bring the crisis under control, which could undermine the image of Davis 
as a methodical, but sure-footed chief executive.

Consumer frustration keeps pace with rate hikes 
Posted at 10:44 p.m. PST Monday, March 26, 2001 
BY MICHAEL CRONK 

Mercury News 


Faced with yet another surge in their monthly utility bills, consumers have a 
couple of questions they'd like answered: 
Is there ever going to be a limit to energy costs? And just how much money do 
the power companies really need? 
Oh, and Carol Wilson of Campbell has another. What more can be expected of 
her and other residents who have significantly cut back on their energy usage 
``other than freezing to death or not cooking.'' 
Officials with the state's Public Utilities Commission say the proposed 
average hike in residential electricity rates of more than 20 percent is 
meant, in part, to encourage energy conservation and to avoid power problems 
this summer. 
But residents, who point out that they don't have money to burn, say they've 
had no choice but to conserve energy anyway. 
``We're keeping use down to the best of our ability. My husband, Jerry, and I 
sit home nights wearing jackets, huddled under blankets. We eat out more and 
prepare more cold meals so we don't have to use our gas burners,'' said 
Wilson, a retired director of medical records for Alexian Brothers Hospital 
in San Jose. ``What's so maddening is we're doing things so our bill will 
come down a bit, and then we look around and see so much waste from the 
bigger users. For example, why don't they shut off some of the lighted signs 
when their businesses aren't open?'' 
Jose Artellaga, a father of three who collects shopping carts for a Redwood 
City supermarket, said he can weather the increase, but he worries about his 
friends who wash dishes or flip burgers for a living. 
``For me it won't be hard, because I make a good salary,'' he said. ``But how 
are they going to pay? It's a massacre.'' 
Artellaga said individual families shouldn't be the ones to pay higher rates 
-- the businesses that consume most of the energy should. 
Art Carey, a retired college instructor from Fremont, has installed 
fluorescent rather incandescent bulbs in his home, lowered the thermostat, 
and runs the swimming pool filter at night. But he said that conservation by 
individual homeowners won't be enough to solve the energy shortfall problem, 
and he worries that low-income families won't be able to absorb the cost 
increases. 
``I'm still convinced that energy supplies are being manipulated by 
out-of-state providers,'' he said. ``It's one of the principal reasons for 
the price increase in gas and electricity.'' 
For Jessica Powers, a 22-year-old who moved to San Francisco from Ohio nine 
months ago, a rate hike could have some practical effects. 
``It could be `no eating out Wednesday nights,'?'' said Powers, who described 
herself as ``just scraping by'' financially. 
Powers and her two roommates have been vigilant about keeping the lights off 
and energy use to a minimum in their Lower Haight apartment, and she 
acknowledged an increase would amount to a minor inconvenience. 
``But for the elderly, immigrants and low-income people, it will more 
drastically change their lives,'' said Powers, a development assistant for 
the San Francisco-based National Center For Lesbian Rights. ``That bothers 
me.'' Contact Michael Cronk at mcronk@sjmercury.com or (408) 343-4523.

Seeing the light in energy crisis 
Tuesday, March 27, 2001 
Reality finally seems to be breaking through a little on the electricity 
crisis: "California's top power regulator proposed a 40 percent hike in 
electricity rates Monday, saying such an increase should encourage customers 
to cut back on usage and conserve enough power to get through the hot summer 
months," AP reported yesterday. 
"Loretta Lynch, president of the Public Utilities Commission, said rates 
should increase by an average of 3 cents per kilowatt hour. The current rate 
averages 7.5 cents per kilowatt hour."
The PUC could vote as early as today to increase rates, with the effective 
date as early as April 1. A rate hike of less than 40 percent also is 
possible. Although Gov. Gray Davis continues publicly to oppose rate hikes, 
Ms. Lynch is a close political associate of his and was appointed by him. 
"It's a move in the right direction," Robert Michaels, a professor of 
economics at Cal State Fullerton, told us. But he said he didn't know how 
much prices should go up because of uncertainty in other areas. "Even in 
Sacramento everybody is saying rates could double in a year. Nobody knows 
what's being spent by the state on short-term energy. Or long-term energy. Or 
knows all the unknowns of the long-term contracts" the state signed earlier 
this month. 
A 40 percent rate increase also wouldn't cover "all the things from the past 
- the bills the utilities have to pay" to the independent electricity 
generators. But there is one positive aspect, he said: "It will convince 
consumers that there really is a scarcity in electricity." 
Unfortunately, a rate increase could come in a politically manipulated form. 
"Gov. Gray Davis, faced with the near inevitability of raising consumers' 
electricity bills, is leaning toward a rate system whereby those who use more 
power pay more than those who conserve," reported the San Francisco 
Chronicle. "Sources close to the governor said he is being lobbied by his own 
staff members to accept a so-called structured rate system."
"I am a fan of restructuring rates to exempt conservation," Ms. Lynch told 
the Chronicle. "People who use a whole lot of power should pay more."
"It's an idea we can use rates to redistribute wealth," Mr. Michaels said. He 
also pointed out that the crisis really doesn't involve large, industrial 
users, who use a mostly constant amount of electricity in their business and 
manufacturing processes year-round. Rather, the problem mainly is with 
residences, which comprise one-third of usage but which are the "main users 
of the peak time, the evening, when air conditioning is turned on."
Can't the state politicians look beyond the current crisis, for once? As the 
state heads into a recession, do we really want to charge more to large 
electricity users, such as businesses? And what if the many new Internet 
"server" businesses can't cut power, just to name one industry? Businesses 
would begin avoiding this state like a cow avoids an electric fence.
And what about people who stay home because they're retired, sick or for some 
other reason? Should they pay more if they can't cut back? We don't charge 
more for gasoline for people who drive 50 miles to work than for people who 
drive 10 miles. Why should electricity be different?
Even as the state moves toward more rational pricing of electricity, the 
mistake would be compounded by a rate structure that might be difficult to 
dismantle as more power plants come on line and the crisis passes.
Finally, this crisis began with a flawed approach to free markets, misnamed 
deregulation, and last fall deepened quickly as Gov. Davis and the 
Legislature responded with every possible government solution that might 
avoid the inevitable - higher electric rates. Now, the state faces the worst 
of all possible worlds: a future with high electrcity prices, inadequate 
power production particularly for summer, a massive debt for power bills owed 
and a potential large deficit blown through what was once a state budget with 
a surplus.

Power rates may surge 
PUC chief proposes a tiered structure that could raise costs for some 
businesses and other big users by up to 36%. 
March 27, 2001 
By KATE BERRY
The Orange County Register 
California's top electricity regulator Monday proposed a rate increase of as 
much as 36 percent that would be shouldered primarily by businesses and 
energy-guzzling consumers. 
The plan by Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities 
Commission, would attempt to solve part of the state's energy crisis by 
raising electricity rates 3 cents per kilowatt-hour. The plan is expected to 
be approved by the commission today. 
The increase would later be subjected to a tiered-rate structure so that the 
more consumers use, the more they would pay, Lynch said. 
"Electricity hogs will need to pay more for the energy they use this 
summer,'' Lynch said at a news conference. 
About 40 percent of residential customers would not be hit by any rate 
increase, Lynch said, because their usage is 130 percent or less of 
"baseline," a subsistence level that varies regionally in the state. 
Consumers who use between 130 percent and 200 percent of baseline would face 
increases of as much as 9 percent, while those who use more than 200 percent 
of baseline would pay the biggest increases. 
Since January, the state has put itself in the precarious position of buying 
power for the utilities at a rate of $45 million to $66 million a day - with 
no mechanism to recoup the funds. 
The rate increase would pay for the state's current and future power 
purchases - which are estimated at $23 billion through 2002. It also would 
cover power purchases from independent producers, known as qualifying 
facilities, whose unwillingness to operate without being paid contributed to 
last week's rolling blackouts. 
The proposed rate increase would come on top of January's increase of 9 
percent to 15 percent. An additional 10 percent increase is planned for next 
year.

Energy notebook 
Senators struggle with PG&E rescue talks 
March 27, 2001 
Bloomberg News 
SACRAMENTO PG&E Corp.'s negotiations with the state of California on a 
financial rescue package are "not encouraging" and the state Senate is 
consulting with bankruptcy lawyers, a top Democratic state senator said. 
The Senate is discussing the possibility that PG&E and aides to Gov. Gray 
Davis won't reach an agreement and creditors will force the state's largest 
utility into bankruptcy, Senate Utilities Committee Chairwoman Debra Bowen 
said. The Legislature has renewed talks in the past week with lawyers on 
potential responses to a bankruptcy filing, she said. 
PG&E and Davis aides are negotiating the sale of the utilities' transmission 
lines in return for billions to help them pay down more than $6 billion in 
past debts. Those talks have so far failed to produce an agreement. 
"Much of what I've heard has not been encouraging" Bowen told reporters 
Monday. "I've been working with utility bankruptcy counsel to make sure we 
have a strategy for what to do if those talks fail." 
PG&E declined to comment on the negotiations. 
California has given PG&E a "detailed offer" and the utility has responded 
with a list of questions, said Joseph Fichera, chief executive of New 
York-based investment adviser Saber Partners LLC. Fichera is leading the 
negotiations for Davis and the state. 
The state is close to an agreement with Edison International, Fichera said. 
Edison's Southern California Edison, the state's No. 2 investor-owned 
utility, has already announced a framework agreement with the state to sell 
its transmission lines for $2.76 billion. 
Generator says it will lower price if assured payment 
CHARLOTTE, N.C. Duke Energy Corp., responding to federal regulators' 
accusations of overcharging in California, said it would take less money if 
given guarantees of payment for the power it has sold. 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission accused Duke earlier this month of 
overcharging California customers by $17.8 million during power shortages in 
January and February. Duke says the prices were reasonable, given the high 
risk that generators won't be paid, company spokesman Jeremy Dreier said. 
California's Independent System Operator, which runs most of the state's 
power grid, had accused generators of overcharging by $6.2 billion since May. 
FERC has ordered Duke and other power generators to refund or justify $124 
million in sales in January and February. 
California's grid operator and the California Power Exchange, where most of 
the state's power was once traded, have paid only "a small percentage of the 
amounts owed" for past electricity purchases, Duke said in a statement. 
Duke said Monday that, though its prices were reasonable, it's willing to 
accept lower payments, provided it receives the rates FERC has deemed 
acceptable. 
"We could be willing to forgo collection of the credit premiums for these 
months, provided we receive the FERC" price, Jim Donnell, president and chief 
executive officer of Duke Energy North America, said in a statement. "If we 
are not assured of payment, the credit premiums are obviously appropriate, 
and we would reserve our right to collect the entire amount." 
FERC set a $273 a megawatt-hour limit on power sales to California during the 
Stage 3 emergencies in January and February.

Resigned to higher rates 
Business officials see little option, though product prices will likely go 
up. 
March 27, 2001 
By KATE BERRY, JOHN HOWARD, 
MARY ANN MILBOURN AND TONY SAAVEDRA
The Orange County Register 
The proposal by California's top energy regulator Monday to raise electricity 
rates will have a significant effect on companies, but business officials 
said they see little alternative. 
"It just doesn't work when you charge a lower price for something that costs 
more to produce," said Kathy Fairbanks, a spokeswoman for the 13,000-member 
California Chamber of Commerce. "We don't want the state of California to end 
up the way PG&E and Southern California Edison ended up. In a perfect world, 
this wouldn't happen. It's not a perfect world." 
The proposal Monday by Loretta Lynch, the president of the California Public 
Utilities Commission, for an electricity rate increase of 3 cents a 
kilowatt-hour also marks a flip-flop by the Davis administration. 
Gov. Gray Davis, who appointed Lynch, has been adamant that a plan to solve 
the state's energy crisis could be worked out without raising consumer rates. 
Lawmakers and energy-industry experts said the change of plan could backfire, 
possibly damaging Davis' political career. 
Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for the governor, said Davis had "not had 
conversations with any commissioners about a potential rate hike," adding 
that "it is his hope and expectation that this matter can be resolved within 
the existing rate structure." 
But lawmakers said the continued high cost of energy and the likelihood of 
more blackouts created pressure for a rate increase. 
"Look at the numbers,'' said Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg, D-Los Angeles. 
"When they started looking at this a couple of months ago, they had hoped to 
do it without any rate increase. But the numbers are what they are. It's up 
to the PUC to keep rates as low as possible." 
Republicans believe Lynch is fronting for Davis, taking the political heat 
for an increase Davis is loathe to endorse. 
"Make no mistake about it - this is a Davis rate hike," Assemblyman Bill 
Campbell, R-Villa Park, said shortly before he was ousted Monday as the 
Assembly's GOP leader. 
Secretary of State Bill Jones, the state's lone Republican statewide 
officeholder, announced his intention Monday to run for governor next year. 
Jones has been sharply critical of Davis' handling of the state electricity 
crisis, saying the governor passed up the chance last fall to buy cheaper 
energy under long-term contracts. 
"He has done great damage to California in the past six months. He has been 
focused on re-election, not policy, and that makes me mad," Jones said. 
Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, said lawmakers have been talking 
about a $23 billion bill to buy power for the state, which would require 
rates to double. 
"That's what changed the landscape," Keeley said. 
Sen. John Burton, D-San Francisco, was more blunt, saying it was clear 
earlier that more money was needed to resolve the energy crisis. 
"It's obvious to me that unless you rob a bank or win a lottery, you are not 
going to be able to do this without raising rates," he said. 
Meanwhile, economists and business leaders seemed resigned to the need for 
rates to rise. 
Economist Tom Liezer of the University of California, Los Angeles, called the 
plan another blow to business, but a minor one compared with wages and other 
costs. 
The bigger issue, he said, is the state's lack of generating capacity, which 
may discourage businesses from locating in the state. 
Energy supplies this summer are expected to fall short by 5,000 megawatts 
during the midday peak, said Jack Stewart, president of the 800-member 
California Manufacturers and Technology Association. He said the rate 
increase "will have a dire impact on many manufacturers." 
"You may see production shifting out of California or closing down,'' he 
said. "But something had to give." 
Stewart forecast companies would have to pass on the rate increase to 
consumers. 
"I don't know how consumer prices can help but go up," he said. 
"There's no question a 40 percent increase would have an impact on 
businesses, but not doing it would have a greater impact," he said, pointing 
to the uncertain power supply and utilities on the verge of bankruptcy. 
Ron Danfield, energy manager at B. Braun Medical Inc. in Irvine, was 
surprised by the proposed increase. 
"Oh, man," Danfield said. "It's going to make our bottom line have some 
problems. We've been trying to enact (energy) saving programs to offset the 
costs we already have. So, how we (conserve more) will require us to be much 
smarter than we already are." 
Hans Biermann, owner of Hans Homemade Ice Cream in Santa Ana, isn't certain 
what he's going to do. 
"I don't know how I can save electricity. If I turn the air conditioning 
down, then my 17 freezers have to work harder," said Biermann, who currently 
pays about $1,200 a month for electricity for his Bristol Avenue shop. "We're 
going to raise our prices a small amount and hope for the best." 
Heino Nurmberg, owner of the two-man Estolith Printing Co. in Santa Ana, said 
he doesn't expect to be hit by the rate increase because he uses so little 
electricity. But he's concerned about placing the burden on the biggest 
users. 
"If the big users that make the products really get hit hard, then everybody 
gets hit because they will raise their prices," Nurmberg said.

ENERGY: EVEN BEFORE PG&E FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY, ALTERNATIVE PLANT OWNERS WHO
HADN'T BEEN PAID IN MONTHS PURSUED COURT ACTIONS.

BYLINE: JULIE TAMAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER



DATELINE: SACRAMENTO

BODY:


??In filing for federal bankruptcy protection last week, Pacific Gas & 
Electric
Co. determined what other power producers had already concluded: The state had
failed to solve their payment problems and the time had come for the courts to
step in.

??In the days leading up to PG&E's Bankruptcy Court petition, a growing number
of alternative energy producers had also been filing lawsuits, seeking to be
freed from their contracts with PG&E and Southern California Edison. The
litigation was triggered in part by a controversial new rate plan imposed last
month by the state Public Utilities Commission in addition to millions of
dollars of debt owed to the producers by the utilities.

??On Tuesday, Dynamis Inc. filed suit in Fresno, saying PG&E owes it $ 3
million.

??Carson-based Watson Cogeneration Co., one of the state's largest alternative
energy producers, also had filed suit to have its contract with Edison
suspended. So did Delta Power, which owns five small gas-fired plants in
California. Both producers are owed tens of millions by Edison.

??At least a dozen such suits have been filed in civil courts, and lawyers 
warn
that more could be on the way.

??"Tough solutions were not being brought to the equation, which left PG&E and
others feeling they were better off in the court system," said Jerry Bloom, an
attorney for the California Cogeneration Council.

??The court actions come on the heels of an order by the PUC last month that
Edison and PG&E begin fully paying hundreds of small alternative energy
producers. But some producers say that a new rate plan issued by the PUC would
force them to operate at a loss and that nothing has been done to address the
about $ 1.5 billion owed to members of the group by PG&E and Edison.

??Lawyers say other producers have served Edison with notices that they plan 
to
cancel their contracts.

??Gas-fired generators account for about two-thirds of the electricity 
produced
by the alternative energy group.

??The California Independent System Operator, keeper of the state's power 
grid,
reports that there continues to be a roughly 3,000-megawatt reduction in 
output
from the alternative energy producers. The daily sum is enough power to 
supply 2
million to 3 million typical homes.

??"It clearly shows the problem hasn't been fixed," said Jan Smutny-Jones, 
executive director of the Independent Energy Producers.

??California is home to nearly 700 producers of alternative and renewable
energy, which as a group provide more than a quarter of the electricity used 
by
consumers.

??Some of the producers have gone offline or reduced supplies for maintenance
reasons, but others have cut back because they have not been paid by Edison
since November or have received only partial payments from PG&E.

??The drop in output has at times forced the state to purchase replacement
supplies on the pricey spot market for electricity and contributed to rolling
blackouts last month. The latter event prompted Gov. Gray Davis to propose a
plan to get the generators up and running again.

??Consequently, the PUC established a new rate plan for the producers and
ordered the utilities to begin fully paying them beginning this month. The
payment goal would be accomplished in part by slashing the rates that PG&E and
Edison must pay the producers.

??But the PUC action appears to have compelled a growing number of gas-fired
generators to file lawsuits in an effort to be released from their contracts
with the utilities and be paid the millions they are owed.

??Bloom contends that the new rate plan will force some producers to operate 
at
a loss because it does not adequately compensate for their gas expenses. He 
said
he expects generators to challenge the plan in court or before the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission.

??Smutny-Jones contends that the plan wrongly assumes that all natural gas 
used
by his members can be piped in from the Oregon border, where the price of
natural gas is cheaper. The producers, he added, are seeking assurances that
they will be paid realistic rates by the utilities for future deliveries.

??Utilities are scheduled to pay the first round of reduced rates, as ordered
by the PUC, early next week. Both utilities have indicated that they plan to
make the first round of payments.

??Edison officials said Friday they have been served with 10 producer 
lawsuits.
They say they fear that if the generators are let out of their contracts, they
could sell their supplies out of state, which could in turn cause rates to 
rise
for California consumers because it would reduce supply.

??PG&E spokesman John Nelson said in an interview last week before the
bankruptcy filing that PG&E has been served with two such lawsuits. He said 
his
company is also concerned about the PUC rate plan and whether it truly lowered
the rates PG&E must pay the alternative producers and whether there would be
enough money in the rates paid by customers to turn around and pay the
producers.

??"We're concerned that the commission decision does not solve the problem,"
Nelson said.

??A Davis spokesman said last week that the administration is still working on
the issue of money owed to the producers and that the administration is
continuing to work with the PUC to get more generators back online.

??Observers believe the number of producer lawsuits will grow because most
cases to date have been aimed at Edison. The utility has not paid its 
producers
since November and has fought to have its rates slashed.

??By comparison, PG&E has made efforts to partially pay its producers in 
recent
months and to keep them informed of their financial situation.

??A Bankruptcy Court is expected to decide whether to affirm the contracts of
producers who sell to PG&E or to free them to sell their power elsewhere.

??An Imperial County judge has already freed CalEnergy, a small geothermal
producer, from its contract with Edison because of Edison's failure to pay the
company. The court has delayed ruling on CalEnergy's request for $ 99 million 
in
back payments until April 16--the day the utility is expected to begin paying
its alternative generators.

??Since it quit transmitting 270 megawatts to Edison last month, CalEnergy has
been selling its electricity to El Paso Energy, a marketing company that 
resells
power on the spot market. If other generators are able to repeat the pattern, 
it
could further reduce state energy supplies, particularly this summer, when 
every
megawatt will be needed to avoid blackouts.

HEADLINE: California's Largest Utility Files for Bankruptcy

BYLINE: ?By LAURA M. HOLSON

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, April 6

BODY:

??The Pacific Gas and Electric Company, California's largest investor-owned
utility, filed for bankruptcy protection today, declaring that politicians and
regulators had not moved quickly enough to resolve an energy crisis that has
caused periodic rolling blackouts and is costing the state billions of 
dollars.

??The filing, which seeks reorganization under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy
code, shifts decision-making about crucial aspects of the California energy
debacle from officials in Sacramento, the state capital, to a federal 
bankruptcy
court in San Francisco, where Pacific Gas and Electric has its headquarters.

???The utility hopes to have more success in court in trying to win relief 
from
$9 billion in wholesale energy debt it says it has incurred since prices began
soaring last May. Legislators and regulators have been loath to bail out 
Pacific
Gas and Electric or the No. 2 utility, Southern California Edison, whose
billions in debt to wholesalers and marketers stem from flawed state
deregulation that did not allow the utilities to pass on rising costs to
consumers.

??The filing came as a surprise to many, particularly Gov. Gray Davis, who in 
a
televised speech only Thursday night reversed his stand against electricity 
rate
increases, acknowledging that consumers would have to pay more.

??For months, the two utilities had complained that they were running out of
cash and had demanded that rates be increased to cover their costs, but they 
had
not made good on any threat to file for bankruptcy. The reason, in part, was
that the governor's office, in trying to forestall a greater sense of
uncertainty surrounding the energy crisis, was negotiating to keep the 
utilities
solvent by buying their transmission lines.

??On Tuesday, executives from Pacific Gas and Electric met for four hours with
the governor's negotiators. On Thursday, Wall Street analysts said they had 
been
told by the governor's representatives that there were hopes some resolution
could be reached. That night the governor proposed a plan, with rate 
increases a
centerpiece, that he said would help pay off the utilities' debts.

??In the end, none of this was enough for Pacific Gas and Electric. In a
conference call with reporters today, Robert D. Glynn Jr., chairman of the
utility and of its parent company, the PG&E Corporation, said the governor was
not moving fast enough, having delayed a face-to-face meeting for weeks.

??"We've heard a lot of the words that have been involved, but we have not 
seen
a lot of actions," Mr. Glynn said. "The regulatory and political processes 
have
failed us, and now we are turning to the court."

??Mr. Glynn said the bankruptcy filing would not affect customer service. And,
he said, it involves only Pacific Gas and Electric, which operates in Northern
and Central California, and not the parent company itself or its other units.

??Southern California Edison, meanwhile, said today that it would continue to
try to reach an agreement with the governor.

??Responding to the announcement by Pacific Gas and Electric, Governor Davis
said the company had "dishonored itself."

??"This action was unnecessary," he said. "They've caused undue alarm. PG&E 
was
not pushed into bankruptcy, but plunged themselves into bankruptcy for their 
own
strategic advantage -- not the best interests of the people of California."

??A few months ago, in a move widely criticized by consumer groups and
legislators, the PG&E Corporation took steps to ensure that the assets of its
other subsidiaries would not be seized in case of a Pacific Gas bankruptcy. 
Just
this week the State Public Utilities Commission said it would investigate
whether Pacific Gas and Electric, Southern California Edison and the state's 
No.
3 investor-owned utility, San Diego Gas and Electric, had engaged in any
financial misconduct by funneling billions to their parent companies to pay
dividends and repurchase stock.

??Trading in PG&E stock was halted briefly today. When it resumed, the price
quickly fell by nearly 40 percent. By day's end, the stock of Edison
International, parent of Southern California Edison, had also dropped sharply,
by 35 percent.

??That Pacific Gas and Electric, which helped design the deregulation that
brought on the California power crisis, would now take so drastic a step both
concerned and puzzled analysts. "It doesn't make sense, because the governor
endorsed the rate increase the utilities had been asking for," said Susan
Abbott, head of the power group at Moody's Investors Service in New York.

??But Ms. Abbott also noted that the rate increases -- varying from 10 percent
to 37 percent, on top of a 9 percent surcharge adopted by the state this 
winter
-- would not entirely eliminate the debt accumulated by the utilities as a
result of deregulation. "There were a lot of people who said, 'Great, the
utilities' problems are over,' " she said. "But they are not."

??The bankruptcy petition filed by Pacific Gas and Electric reported assets of
$24 billion and debts of $18 billion. In his talk with reporters, Mr. Glynn 
said
the company was still incurring $300 million in monthly wholesale energy costs
that it had no way of paying. But his biggest concern, aside from the stalled
negotiations with the governor, is the Public Utilities Commission.

??For instance, Mr. Glynn complained about the commission's recent change to
the utilities' accounting practices, a step he said would make it even more
difficult for Pacific Gas to recoup any losses. The commission has also said 
it
is the state, which has had to step in as a middleman buying power for the
utilities because many suppliers have cut off their credit, that will be the
first to be paid money flowing from the rise in consumer rates.

??In any event, moving into the bankruptcy court the debate over debt that has
already been incurred should resolve a question that the parties to the issue
have been unable to settle: who indeed will get paid first? Analysts say the
bankruptcy judge, Dennis Montali, will have to consider several issues, in
particular that electricity is a vital necessity.

??That being the case, it is likely that the power generators, which have been
called price gougers and pirates but have supplied the state with enough 
energy
to keep the lights on, will have priority among the creditors. That is good 
news
for many of the state's smaller generators, many of which were forced to shut
their doors when Pacific Gas and Electric made only partial payments to them.
After that, analysts say, bondholders will most likely be next in line, 
although
all this will await a judgment by the court, which among other things must 
also
decide what priority the state enjoys.

??"It's going to help focus in a very specific, objective order the manner in
which their financial situation gets sorted out," said Jan Smutny-Jones, 
executive director of the Independent Energy Producers Association, which
represents power generators in the state. "The thing to do when you get in a
hole is stop digging. They did that today."

HEADLINE: Natural gas project OK'd

BYLINE: David Whitney Bee Washington Bureau and Carrie Peyton Bee Staff Writer

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

BODY:

??The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission gave quick approval Friday to a
project that will increase natural gas deliveries for electric power 
generation
in California this summer.

??And in a move that intensified the conflict over who should pay for
California's emergency power needs, FERC also ruled that the state grid 
operator
must find "creditworthy" buyers for all power it procures. The decision could
either drive up electricity prices by removing a state negotiating tool or
increase the risk of rolling blackouts, or both.

??The action to approve a project from the Williams Cos. comes just three 
weeks
after the firm applied for a certificate to add compression stations and other
equipment along its Kern River Transmission Co. line from Wyoming to
Bakersfield.

??With the new stations and equipment, said Williams spokeswoman Beverly
Chipman, the company will be able to deliver an additional 135 million cubic
feet of natural gas into California - enough to generate power for 750,000
homes, she said.

??Chipman said that ordinarily it takes six months to a year to move an
application through FERC. This one sailed through in record time at the 
urgings
of the governors of California, Nevada, Utah and Wyoming, she said.

??The $81 million project will include new compression stations in Utah and
California and the upgrading of compressors units in Wyoming, Utah and Nevada.

??"We are prepared to do whatever we can to rush supplies to West Coast
markets," said FERC chairman Curl Hebert Jr.

??FERC's decision on power sales affects the state Independent System 
Operator,
which operates the electrical grid. For weeks, the state Department of Water
Resources has been opting to buy less power than California needs when it 
feels
prices are too high. The rest - sometimes 1,000 to 2,000 megawatts per hour -
has been bought by the ISO, which operates from Folsom.

??PG&E estimated Friday that the ISO purchases have added about $300 million a
month to its debts. Power sellers, afraid the ISO would not be paid by PG&E or
Southern California Edison, asked federal regulators to force the ISO to find 
a
creditworthy buyer or stop compelling sales.

??FERC had ruled on the issue in February, and on Friday it reinforced that
ruling, saying the ISO misinterpreted its earlier decision and must comply.

??The ruling could increase pressure to find "creative" solutions to who will
pay for California's power, said Jan Smutny-Jones, head of the Independent
Energy Producers Association. "Obviously the ISO doesn't have the money and 
the
utilities don't have the money either. The question is, where do we go from
here," he said. "My hope is that it does not make blackouts more likely."

??The state hasn't decided whether it will appeal the decision, said Roger
Salazar, a spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis. But he said the federal ruling 
appears
to make it likely that California will have to buy more electricity on the
utilities' behalf.

HEADLINE: Filing for Chapter 11 may help PG&E's debt but it won't solve power
crisis

BYLINE: By Brandon Bailey

BODY:

??SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Filing for bankruptcy protection may help PG&E with its
debts, but it won't solve the state's power crunch.

??Power suppliers promised Friday that they will continue to deliver
electricity for California consumers, which means the lights will stay on for
now. But experts and industry spokesmen say that supply won't be enough to
prevent the shortages and rolling blackouts that state officials have 
predicted
for this spring and summer.

??"The summer crisis will still happen," said Bill Highlander of Calpine 
Corp.,
a San Jose-based energy producer. "It's a matter of supply and demand."

??In addition, many experts agreed Friday that Pacific Gas & Electric Co.'s
bankruptcy filing could have little immediate impact on other problems that 
are
plaguing the state's power system: soaring wholesale prices, congested
transmission lines and aging generating plants.

??But some said the action eventually could lead to more rate increases for
consumers, beyond those proposed by Gov. Gray Davis and the state Public
Utilities Commission in recent weeks.

??The reason lies in the fact that a bankrupty judge doesn't have a magic 
wand.

??The court can make sure suppliers fulfill their existing contracts by
guaranteeing that they will be paid for future deliveries, placing them ahead 
of
creditors who are only seeking payment for past debts. A judge may be able to
order PG&E's customers to pay higher rates _ or at least the court can put
pressure on state regulators to authorize rate hikes.

??But a judge can't order PG&E's suppliers to build new power plants or speed
up expansion of existing generators. Analysts also said they don't believe a
judge has the authority to limit wholesale prices on the spot market, where 
much
of the state's energy is still bought and sold.

??PG&E has said it's been unable to pay its suppliers because it has a
multibillion-dollar deficit from buying power at wholesale prices that the 
state
won't allow it to pass on to consumers. Instead, the state of California has
been buying power for PG&E and Southern California Edison while attempting to
negotiate a bailout for both utilities.

??Some industry spokesmen expressed hope that the bankruptcy filing would give
PG&E suppliers more assurance about getting paid in the future _ and prevent 
the
state's energy markets from careening further out of control.

??Still, other analysts warned that if the filing delays payment to smaller
power generators, who provide up to a third of the state's supply, it could
drive more of them out of the market.

??"I just don't see any upside to this at all," said Peter Navarro, a 
professor
of economics and public policy at University of California-Irvine, who has
closely followed the effects of deregulation on the state's energy industry.

??Spokesmen for some of the state's largest generators, including Calpine, 
Duke
Energy and Dynegy Inc., said PG&E's action would have no effect on their
operations.

??"It really shouldn't have any effect on our putting output into the grid,"
said Tom Williams of Duke Energy, which owns three power plants in Northern
California.

??In large part, that is because these companies have not been selling 
directly
to PG&E for several months. Since the utility began developing financial
problems last fall, several major suppliers said they have been negotiating
contracts with other buyers. Dynegy, for example, has committed its output in
contracts with the state of California. Duke has agreements with other 
wholesale
energy buyers and traders.

??If the bankruptcy filing allows PG&E to reorganize its debts and eventually
re-enter the energy market on a more stable footing, Steve Stengel of Dynegy
said, "today's action could actually be a catalyst to moving forward toward a
long-term solution."

??But a number of small generators have already shut down their plants because
PG&E and Southern California Edison, the state's other major utility, haven't
paid for past deliveries. That has kept about 3,000 megawatts off-line and
contributed to shortages that caused the state's Independent System Operator 
to
declare power alerts on several days last month.

??As the weather gets warmer, the Independent System Operator has warned that
shortages will get worse. And the prospects for bringing those small 
generators
back online are uncertain.

??Some of those small producers have said they may have to file for bankruptcy
protection themselves. One spokesman said companies that are currently 
operating
their plants will continue in operation for at least 30 days, until they see
what the bankruptcy court will do.

??But if the court doesn't authorize a plan for paying those companies what
they are owed, both for past deliveries and future energy production, Jan 
Smutny-Jones of the Independent Energy Producers Association warned, some 
small
firms may ask the court to excuse them from their contracts with PG&E.

??That could allow the small producers to sell their electricity on the spot
market, where prices are generally higher than what the generators were 
promised
in their utility contracts, Smutny-Jones added. That could leave the state
buying even more power at higher prices.

??While the state has been buying most of the power delivered to utility
customers, the Independent System Operator has continued to make some
spot-market purchases directly on behalf of the utilities. The ISO makes those
last-minute purchases to meet the state's electricity needs when the state has
been unable to purchase enough power in advance.

??In a separate development Friday, federal authorities ruled that generators
cannot be forced to sell power to the ISO if there is no guarantee of payment.
And some analysts suggested that PG&E's bankruptcy filing may jeopardize the
ISO's ability to make last-minute purchases on the utility's behalf.

??A spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis, however, told the Associated Press that the
state may simply step in to guarantee payment on those transactions. And an 
ISO
spokeswoman said her agency is confident it will be able to continue those
transactions.

??But few experts held out hope Friday that a bankruptcy court would order
suppliers to reduce their prices, which have soared in recent months.

??While the court might force suppliers to accept a reduction in payment for
past deliveries, "I don't think it's going to be able to affect prices going
into the future," said consumer group attorney Mike Florio, who sits on the 
ISO
governing board.

??As for the prices that individual consumers pay, many suppliers have argued,
along with PG&E, that the utility needs to be able to raise its retail rates
even more than already proposed.

??While consumer advocates contend that any rate increases are unjustified,
industry analysts said they are hopeful a judge will be convinced otherwise.

??"I think the long-term result will be that rates will increase more than 
what
has been talked about already," said Brian Youngberg, an analyst for the Wall
Street firm Edward Jones Inc.

HEADLINE: PG&E Bankruptcy Will Not Affect Calpine's Commitment to California
Power Market

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Calif., April 9

BODY:

??In response to Pacific Gas and Electric Company's (PG&E) April 6th Chapter 
11
filing, Calpine Corporation (NYSE: CPN), the San Jose, Calif.-based 
independent
power company, stated it is confident that PG&E, through a successful
reorganization, will be able to pay Calpine's Qualifying Facility (QF)
subsidiaries for all past due power sales, in addition to electricity 
deliveries
made on a going-forward basis.

???Calpine's QF subsidiaries sell power to PG&E under the terms of long-term 
QF
contracts at eleven facilities, representing nearly 600 megawatts of 
electricity
for Northern California power customers. ?As of March 31, 2001, Calpine has
recorded approximately $267 million in accounts receivable with PG&E, plus a 
$68
million note receivable not yet due and payable. ?The company's remaining
California operations, totaling approximately 700 megawatts of capacity, 
provide
electricity to municipalities and other creditworthy third parties.

???Calpine's QF facilities are part of a 9,000-megawatt QF supply that provide
California customers with a long-term source of electricity at prices
significantly below current wholesale prices. ?This critical power supply
represents approximately 33 percent of the state's power demand. ?Without 
these
contracts in place for this summer, California faces the prospect of more
blackouts and hundreds of millions of dollars in increased costs.

???For these QF contracts to continue, PG&E must assume the contracts in the
bankruptcy proceedings. ?In order to assume these contracts, PG&E will be
required to cure all outstanding defaults, including paying all past due
amounts. ?If PG&E fails to assume the contracts, Calpine's QF subsidiaries 
will
be able to sell power on the open market and seek damages from PG&E for breach
of contract through the bankruptcy claims resolution process.
????"As the state's leading developer of new electric generating facilities,
Calpine remains committed to providing innovative solutions for California's

HEADLINE: ?Governor Davis, Utility Toss Blame

BYLINE: GARY GENTILE


DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

BODY:

???Gov. Gray Davis and Pacific Gas & Electric executives traded acrimonious
barbs but no solutions as the state's largest utility headed into bankruptcy
court claiming $9 billion in debts.

??On Sunday, Davis appeared on two nationally televised news programs to 
berate
PG&E for awarding an estimated $50 million in bonuses and raises to about 
6,000
midlevel managers and support staff on the eve of its filing for bankruptcy
protection Friday.

??''Management at PG&E is just focused upon padding their own pockets, not in
discharging their duty to serve their many customers in California,'' Davis 
said
on ABC's ''World News Tonight.''

??Earlier, Davis had issued a statement saying PG&E ''management is suffering
from two afflictions: Denial and greed.''

??In response, PG&E defended their employee bonus package and took a swipe at
the governor.

??''Instead of focusing all his attention on solving the state's yearlong and
ever-worsening energy crisis, the governor has launched a campaign-style 
attack
on our company,'' a PG&E statement read.

??The rancor came at the start of a hectic week. A San Francisco bankruptcy
judge was to hold PG&E's first bankruptcy hearing Monday or Tuesday to
determine, among other priorities, which creditors will be paid and in what
order.

??Davis, meanwhile, was still locked in faltering negotiations with Southern
California Edison, the state's second-largest utility, which also claims the
state's flawed 1996 deregulation law is the cause of its financial woes.

??Davis is hoping to strike a deal to buy Edison's share of the power
transmission system for $2.76 billion, which would provide Edison with a
much-needed cash-flow to restructure its debt.

??SoCal Edison executives have said they would continue negotiations with
Davis, but weekend talks in San Francisco failed to resolve any of the
outstanding issues on the table, said Davis' spokesman Steven Maviglio.

??Edison was to file an update on its financial condition with the Securities
and Exchange Commission on Monday.

HEADLINE: ?PG&E Investors Worry About Nest Eggs
DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO
BODY:

???Stocks that were once thought to be as safe as the bank plummeted with
Pacific Gas and Electric Co.'s bankruptcy filing last week, leaving many
investors with empty nest eggs.

??''About all it's good for now is that I can light a fire with it,'' said 
J.P.
Abbott, 80, a retired Walnut Creek transportation executive.

??Abbott and his wife have been reinvesting dividends from their 500 shares of
PG&E stock for the past 20 years. They had recently been talking about cashing
out, but weren't quick enough to beat Friday's news.

??PG&E filed for federal bankruptcy protection hours after Gov. Gray Davis 
delivered a public speech Thursday about the state's energy crisis.

??PG&E Corp. Chairman Robert Glynn said negotiations with Davis had broken
down, and Chapter 11 was the only alternative left to alleviate the company's 
$9
billion debt it accumulated from buying energy for customers whose rates were
capped.

??''We've heard a lot of the words that have been involved, but have not seen 
a
lot of actions,'' Glynn said.

??Shares of PG&E Corp. stock fell more than 37 percent Friday when trading
resumed after a halt of more than two hours. The shares closed at $7.20, down
$4.18, on the New York Stock Exchange. The 52-week high was $32.50.

??The company was founded in 1905, and by 1935 it was Northern California's 
dominant supplier of gas and electricity and a stable place to invest money.

??Over the years, many of it's employees bought stock. The utility estimates 
80
percent of them own shares.

??Don Gregory, 69, of San Rafael kept 3,000 shares, or one-third, of his PG&E
stock after retiring from the company in 1987. Now he wishes he'd sold it all
while times were good.

??A federal bankruptcy judge will now provide a framework for PG&E's creditors
to collect some of their money, while allowing the utility to operate 
normally.

??The judge also has the power to order consumers to pay PG&E's debts.

??In filing for Chapter 11 federal bankruptcy protection, PG&E said it also 
has
$2.6 billion in cash and bills of $4.4 billion.

??California utilities, including PG&E, are struggling with massive debts
related to the state's power crisis. Utilities have been crippled by
skyrocketing wholesale energy prices, which they haven't been able to pass 
along
to consumers under the rules of a recent deregulation of the state's power
market.

HEADLINE: California Governor, PG&E Trade Shots In Wake Of Utility's 
Bankruptcy
Filing.

BODY:

??ABC News (4/8, story 4, Muller) reported last night, "Reaction was swift and
angry to the news that, just hours before declaring bankruptcy, PG&E awarded 
$50
million in bonuses to some 6,000 employees." Gov. Gray Davis was shown saying,
"Management at PG&E is just focused on padding their own pockets, not in
discharging their duty to serve their many customers in California." ABC 
added,
"PG&E, in turn, criticized the Governor for launching a campaign-style attack,
adding that the bonuses went not to senior executives but to midlevel 
employees
who 'had worked tirelessly through this crisis.' And, in fact, bankruptcy
attorneys say such payments are not unusual during Chapter 11 reorganization. 
.
Reasonable or outrageous, all this bickering has fueled the animosity between
the Governor and the utility. And that worries even the Governor's allies in 
the
state capital. . Certainly, the stakes are high. If the state cannot resolve 
its
energy crisis, the economy will suffer, far beyond the borders of California."
The Washington Post/Reuters (4/9) reports that PG&E "defended its award of $50
million in employee bonuses a day before declaring bankruptcy. 'The money was
part of our employees' overall compensation package. Part of it is based on 
the
financial condition of the company, and part is based on meeting departmental
targets,' Ron Low, a spokesman for Pacific G&E, a unit of PG&E Corp., said
today." The Los Angeles Times (4/9) editorializes, "The bankruptcy of Pacific
Gas & Electric has legal scholars puzzling over how federal court supervision 
of
the debt-ridden utility will affect rate-setting, sale of assets such as the
transmission system and the state's role in the crisis. ?And that's apart from
figuring out how it affects Southern California Edison, the chief private
utility in the southern part of the state. Despite executives' denials of any
bankruptcy plans, will Edison be forced into the same boat? Even with all 
these
questions, a good shake can have benefits." The Times adds, "If PG&E's
bankruptcy speeds debt resolution and focuses the governor and Legislature on
reforming the state's power generation, transmission and pricing systems,
business will welcome any increase in predictability. Californians are starved
for answers. The federal court's involvement, despite the grave circumstances,
could provide some."

??Cheney Says Administration Has Responded "Very Aggressively." Vice President
Dick Cheney, asked on "Meet The Press" (4/8), whether the power shortage in
California was just a California problem said, "No, it's not. We've in fact
responded very aggressively to Governor Davis's request. We've approved
virtually every request he's made, in terms of speeding up the permitting
process, so they can get the permits they need. We have dealt as effectively 
as
possible, much more effectively than the Clinton administration ever did.
Separate and apart from that, of course, the President is the first one in a
long time to put together a task force, which I chair now, to develop a 
national
energy policy to deal with these kinds of problems in the future. But for the
Democrats to be making noises that somehow we've been in office now 10 weeks 
and
the shortage of power in California is something we caused is just silly."

??Bankruptcy Judge Profiled. The Los Angeles Times (4/9, Dolan) profiles US
Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali, "who will oversee Pacific Gas & Electric Co. 
's
bankruptcy reorganization." The Times reports Montali "is a highly respected
scholar and effective mediator known for persuading reluctant parties to reach
agreement. In a recent case, Montali achieved in only three days a settlement
between a debtor and creditors in the bankruptcy of an international 
engineering
firm. The case had been in bruising litigation for two years when another 
judge
asked Montali to mediate it." The Times adds, " He will be calling the shots 
in
one of the largest bankruptcy reorganizations in US history. The case raises
unprecedented legal questions and is expected to make new law. Some of the 
legal
disputes may wind up before the US Supreme Court, attorneys said. Lawyers who
know the easygoing, witty judge say he is probably relishing this legal
challenge the way a golfer looks forward to playing a new and more difficult
course. The court action begins today, when Montali is expected to decide
whether PG&E can spend cash that others have laid claims to." The New York 
Times
(4/9, Holson) reports that experts "are divided about how much power Dennis
Montali.can wield. First, there is little case history for Judge Montali to 
rely
on. Previous utility bankruptcies have dealt with different issues and paled 
in
comparison to Pacific Gas and Electric's troubles, which is the largest
investor-owned utility bankruptcy filing in history and the third-largest
corporate bankruptcy ever. Second, industry experts say that any rate 
increases
included in the utility's reorganization plan would have to be approved by the
California Public Utilities Commission." The Times adds, "The judge will have 
to
sort out which creditors get paid first. Most analysts think that the power
generators will be first in line. But whether the money from any rate 
increases
will be funneled to the state, which has been buying electricity on behalf of
the troubled utilities, or to the utilities will be hotly debated in court. If
the bankruptcy judge decides to side with utilities, that could jeopardize the
state's already tenuous plan to issue as much as $14 billion in revenue bonds,
which would be used to help cover the state's energy spending." The Times also
reports, "Whatever the outcome, Pacific Gas and Electric will not be able to
escape what it seems to be trying to avoid: a political solution. Governor 
Davis
and regulators will still play a role in resolving the broader energy crisis
here despite critics who say they have failed miserably thus far. The judge,
too, will have to negotiate over rate increases with the Public Utilities
Commission -- which will be keeping more than a watchful eye on the 
proceedings
-- when a plan is adopted."

??Publicity Aside, California Still Pays Less For Power Than Several States.
The Los Angeles Times (4/9, Slater) reports, "For all its energy notoriety and
outrage over surging electricity rates, California has plenty of company. Much
of the nation faces double-digit price hikes, and several states -- especially
in the East -- continue to pay more for electricity than California. .
Overshadowed by the rhetoric, lawsuits and rolling blackouts is the fact that
Californians have been paying less for electricity than residents in Rhode
Island, New Hampshire, Vermont, New York, Alaska and, by a longshot, Hawaii.
California, in fact, is barely in the top 10 when it comes to electrical 
prices." The Times adds, "One of the reasons that Californians have been 
paying
less is because they conserve more, with the average resident draining 40% 
less
from the grid than the average American. Another reason, however, is that
California's rates have been frozen by law, even as the lids have been coming
off the prices in other states that are deregulating their utilities."

??Oklahoma Building 14 Power Plants In Hopes Of Generating Revenue From 
Western
Power Crisis. ABC News (4/8, story 5, Simpson) reported last night, " The 
power
crisis is not universally bad news. One state, Oklahoma, is betting that its
willingness to welcome power plants will pay off down the road." ABC 
(Karlinsky)
added, "It is a power plant. Under construction even though the entire state
already has all the power it needs. 14 new power plants are being built
statewide. Private power producers are moving in with one goal -- to make 
power
in Oklahoma and sell it to the rest of the country. . Much of the power will 
be
exported to parts of the Southeast and Southwest where energy shortfalls 
haven't
yet reached California proportions, but where demand is growing quickly.
Analysts say the state will make hundreds of millions of dollars in tax 
revenue
while creating more than 20,000 jobs, revitalizing small towns like Coweta by
luring companies in with new tax incentives. Analysts say making electricity
could be the biggest boom to hit this state since the oil rush of the early
1900s. . With the nation's third largest supply of natural gas available to 
run
the plants, the only obstacle so far has been finding enough transmission 
lines
to get the power to the markets that need it."

HEADLINE: COMPANIES & FINANCE INTERNATIONAL: Southern Edison says no to filing

BYLINE: By PAUL ABRAHAMS

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

BODY:

??Southern California Edison, the state's second-biggest electricity 
distributor, said over the weekend that it had no intention of emulating 
Pacific
Gas & Electric, whose electricity distribution business on Friday filed for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

??On Saturday Southern Edison executives met Gray Davis, California's 
embattled
governor. He spent the rest of the weekend with his legal team discussing a
strategy to ensure northern California's electricity supply.

??PG&E's decision to seek bankruptcy for its distribution operations, almost
immediately after Mr Davis made a rare state-wide television speech last
Thursday evening, is a serious embarrassment to the moderate Democratic
governor. During the address he had conceded the need for price rises of up to
40 per cent.

??Mr Davis had previously promised to prevent sharp increases in electricity 
prices. He had also undertaken to stop the state's utilities declaring
bankruptcy following California's botched 1996 power deregulation. Mr Davis's 
office said the governor had been surprised by PG&E's decision.

??The deregulation allowed for free pricing in California's wholesale
electricity market, but prevented distributors such as PG&E from passing on
increased costs to consumers. PG&E lost Dollars 8.9bn because of massive
increases in the cost of wholesale electricity that it could not recoup from 
its
customers. Energy costs it should have reimbursed were running at Dollars 
300m a
month. At the end March, the group had Dollars 2.6bn in cash and Dollars 4.4bn
of outstanding bills.

??The financial impact of PG&E's collapse is likely to be considerable. Among
PG&E's leading lenders are Bank of New York, which was owed Dollars 2.2bn in
September, as well as Bank of America, Wells Fargo and JP Morgan Chase.

??Bond insurance companies with exposure to California utilities debt include
MBIA and Ambac Financial Group, whose shares fell 9.3 per cent and 4.7 per 
cent
respectively on Friday. MBIA said its direct net par exposure to PG&E was 
about
Dollars 590m.

HEADLINE: GLOBAL INVESTING: Hard sell expected for California bonds: While
details are sketchy, the state is hoping to help solve its power troubles
through the Dollars 10bn-Dollars 14bn issue,

BODY:

??California officials might have to draw on a hard-sell technique to lure
investors to the mammoth Dollars 10bn-Dollars 14bn bond issue the state hopes 
to
sell to help solve its power troubles.

??But industry participants say the state probably plans to do just that,
rather than risk a lukewarm investor appetite for a complex municipal bond 
deal
that would be a record for California and among the largest in the market's
history.

??"This issue will be well received (among investors) if the state does a good
job in detailing both the financing and flow of funds given the extraordinary
circumstances," said Steve Kelleher, senior vice president with bond firm 
Sutro
& Co in San Francisco.

??The devil is in the details, said traders, and the state is about as short 
on
specifics as it is on electricity reserves.

??Last week, the California Public Utilities Commission set an annual revenue
target of Dollars 3.35bn in collections from the utilities for power purchased
by the state on their behalf. Under state law, that amount allows for maximum
bond size of between Dollars 12bn and Dollars 14bn if the state opts to go 
ahead
and issue the debt.

??In turn, proceeds from the bond sale, which is expected in May, would be 
used
by the state to purchase more power.

??The state began buying power on behalf of PG&E Corp's Pacific Gas and
Electric unit - which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Friday - and Edison
International's Southern California Edison subsidiary in January. The 
utilities
have run up more than Dollars 13bn in debt buying power on the spot wholesale
market, which they must sell at rates capped by state regulators well below
their costs.

??Proceeds from the bond sale are expected to be used to pay back the state's
general fund, which has already been tapped for billions of dollars in power
purchases, and to pay for long-term power contracts negotiated by Governor 
Gray
Davis and power generators.

??Selling bonds is just one part of a contentious financial plan outlined by 
Mr
Davis and state officials to combat the power crisis as the heavy summer usage
season nears.

??Warren Gordon, a manager on the tax-exempt trading desk with Charles Schwab
in San Francisco, said the muni market does not even know yet whether the
offering will comprise taxable and tax-exempt securities and what the 
allocation
might be between the two.

??But he said that despite the state's power woes, the water authority has 
been
historically "one of the strongest credits (in the marketplace) . . . a good
trading name," a record that might help win investor interest.

??Even as the state's general obligation debt was placed on credit watch by
rating agency Standard & Poor's earlier this year, the water resource 
department
maintained its strong AA rating and stayed clear of credit watch owing to a
strong revenue surplus.

??Philip Angelides, state treasurer, has also proposed a bridge loan to help
the water authority, which has already spent about Dollars 4bn on power costs.
Longer-term bond proceeds would pay off the short-term loan.

??JP Morgan Chase, which has been named lead underwriter of the power debt,
previously said it could arrange a Dollars 3bn bridge loan until the bonds 
could
be sold.

??"It's an interesting financing" plan, Mr Gordon said of the state's 
proposal.
Remaining questions over the revenue stream to support the bonds leave the
market unclear whether the debt would be considered private-activity bonds or
bonds to be backed by money from the general fund, which can determine their
credit ratings and, essentially, the interest owed bondholders, Mr Gordon 
said.

??Among other things, the CPUC must determine what part of recent consumer 
rate
increases will go to the state and how much of any revenue stream from 
consumer
bills would go to servicing debt on the bonds, the panel said.

??Mr Kelleher said the pending deal compares to the unprecedented bond sale by
the Long Island Power Authority a few years ago. For that deal, bond sellers
"went overboard in educating investors," he said.

??California officials "know that the market isn't going to swallow up a
Dollars 9bn to Dollars 14bn issue just because we're sunny and good looking.

??"The opinion in the broker-dealer arena is that there has so far been a lot
of noise and no music yet. We need to hear something that resembles music."

HEADLINE: Stranded Cost Securitizations Take Off, But Don't Expect an 
Avalanche
of Deals: Issuance hits $6 billion as California and courts cast a shadow

BYLINE: Mairin Burns (mairin.burns@tfn.com)

BODY:

??As the downside of electricity deregulation makes news in California, a 
small
niche of the asset-backed securitization market that has developed as part of
the shift to competitive pricing is suddenly taking off. How far the sector 
will
fly is another matter.
?Three so-called stranded cost securitizations have come to market this year,
raising the total issued to $6 billion. The latest, a $1.4 billion deal from
Connecticut Light and Power that closed 10 days ago, added vital liquidity to 
a
market in which just one bond offering priced last year. The Connecticut deal
came on the heels of a benchmark $2.5 billion transaction from Public Service
Electric and Gas, and a $1.7 billion securization from Detroit Edison.
?Stranded cost securitizations first emerged in the mid-1990s as a way for
utilities to recoup their losses on unprofitable assets or investments, in 
order
to prepare them for deregulation. To recoup those losses, some utilities are
requesting the right to force customers or competitors to pay them off. The 
cash
flow from those payments is what's used to back the securities and pay off
bondholders.
?It's not clear how much growth potential exists in the stranded-cost market,
however. Consumer challenges have slowed the process in some states, and
California's woes may entice some states to resist deregulation altogether. 
"The
example of California is a disincentive to restructure and has a chilling 
effect
on elected officials as to the impact of changes in the electricity market,"
says Ellen Lapson, a managing director in the global power group at Fitch. 
Other
states aren't sitting on unprofitable investments and so don't need to
securitize them.
?But the recent flurry of stranded cost securitizations should entice more
investors to the sector, making it worth their while doing the extensive
research involved. "The sheer size of these deals creates natural liquidity,"
says Gordon Sweely, managing director in structured finance trading at Lehman
Brothers. "More investors will look at the sector as a credit card substitute
with added spread."
?Indeed, the investor base for stranded rate securitizations is much the same 
as
it is for credit card or auto-backed transactions. Stranded-cost buyers 
demand a
slight premium based on the uniqueness of the asset. This typically amounts to
an extra five basis points for the shorter maturities, and around 12bps for a
10-year deal. In addition, the investor gets a diversification play and the
satisfaction of knowing that his or her investment is more secure than other 
ABS
issues.
?That's because consumers need electricity. "The underlying receivables have a
lower default rate than almost any other type of receivables we know of," says
Fitch's Lapson. In addition, the costs are spread across a large group of
electricity consumers.
?The securities, which are structured so that they can receive a AAA-rating,
also are largely insulated from deteriorating credit conditions of the utility
that issues them. That's because consumers theoretically will be required to 
pay
the costs regardless of what happens to the utility. As a result, 
rating-agency
downgrades of California's two largest utilities have had no impact on the
ratings of bonds in the sector, and the rating agencies say that that such 
bonds
should retain their AAA-status even in the event of a utility defaulting.
?So far only 11 of these deals have been issued, and of those deals, seven 
have
been underwritten by two leading asset-backed players-Salomon Smith Barney and
Lehman Brothers. "There is a tendency for ourselves, and someone like Salomon,
to be first with unique, more heavily structured products," said Lehman's
Sweely. "These deals fall into that category." The league table situation is
unlikely to change while the future of the sector remains in question.
?Meanwhile, the pipeline is still brimming with potential deals from states 
that
have already ruled in favor of passing on such costs to consumers. There 
remains
a limit to the market's potential. Typically, a visit to the stranded cost
securitization market is a one-time event. But in a few cases, utilities make
the trip more than once. Illinois Power and Commonwealth Edison may return to
market as did PECO Energy Co., in order to raise the remainder of the desired
funds.
?It appears that the recent flurry of activity was coincidental, which means
there may be no more deals for some time. That's because in large part, the 
pace
of issuance depends on how long it takes the various states to give their seal
of approval, particularly if consumers mount a court challenge, as has 
occurred
in Texas. Analysts estimate that the securitization of stranded costs for TXU
Electric, Central Power and Light and Reliant Energy could have taken place as
early as last April were it not for their cases' slow progress past the state
utility regulator, the Public Service Commission, and through the courts. 
While
the Texas utilities could be in the market by this summer, if the courts drag
their heels, the utilities could just as easily be sitting on the sidelines 
when
full deregulation comes into effect on Jan. 1, 2002.

??Gov. Gray Davis should follow Pacific Gas & Electric's example and admit 
that
his electricity program is also bankrupt. The governor's primary objective was
to keep the utilities from bankruptcy. He has failed. He should admit his
failure and reformulate his policy. Whatever he does must be based on a clear
understanding of the problem.

??The people of California have a right to buy electricity at fair prices.
Producers of electricity are entitled to a fair return on their investment.
Before 1998, a balance between these two points was struck by the Public
Utilities Commission using cost-of-service pricing. Utilities presented their
production bills, the PUC reviewed them, determined a reasonable rate of 
return
and set a rate high enough to cover both. California became the second most
efficient user of electricity in the country under this system, and its
utilities prospered.

??In 1996, the electric power industry, with promises of lower prices, induced
Gov. Pete Wilson, the PUC and the Legislature to reduce the commission's power
to ensure just and reasonable electricity prices. Under the power industry's
system competition, not regulation, would set prices, and prices would go 
down.
PG&E head Robert Glynn represented it to be a "huge opportunity for consumers 
to
lower their energy costs." PG&E, San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern
California Edison, with PUC approval, then sold California's most significant
generation plants, its gas-fired units, to five multinational corporations.

??These five companies led the onslaught on California consumers, raising
electricity prices from $ 7 billion in 1999 to a projected $ 70 billion in 
2001.
California authorities have determined that 98% of the price bids submitted by
these five companies--some 25,000--were based on monopoly, not competitive,
pricing. Gov. Davis is right: "California's deregulation scheme is a colossal
and dangerous failure."

??No one--not Wilson, the PUC or the Legislature--provided an exit strategy if
deregulation did not work. Davis has been unable or unwilling to come up with
one. He failed to get on top of the problem when he took office, despite clear
warning signs. He failed to see that he cannot finance ever higher prices with
public funds, and he lacks the resolve to do what he must to stop them. His 
one
effort to use tax funds to keep the utilities out of formal bankruptcy has
failed, with PG&E's filing for Chapter 11 last week.

??There are no good choices now. However, we cannot continue down the road
Davis has chosen. It leads to financial ruin. We cannot rely on private
companies building new generation plants because the same price gougers will
control how the new electricity gets priced. We cannot rely on the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission or President Bush. California can only rely on
California to solve this problem.

??As a first step, Gov. Davis should do what he threatened to do in his State
of the State address: use the power of eminent domain to recover the gas-fired
generation plants that the price manipulators are using to set monopoly 
prices.
He can pay "just compensation" to the owners but not one dime more.

??The governor should now recognize California's vital interest in protecting
itself from these prices. Eminent domain is a reasonable tool to use to 
achieve
that goal. It has been used in less compelling circumstances. For example,
eminent domain was used in the early 1980s for George W. Bush's investment 
team
to assemble the land on which the Texas Rangers' stadium is built, from which 
he
and his partners profited handsomely. If eminent domain can be used for 
private
profit, it can be used to protect the vital interests of the state of
California. The plants should be divested to private ownership, but only to
companies that are under PUC jurisdiction.

??The PUC also should be used to plan how California can move forward to an
improved cost-based system of regulation. What we cannot do is to continue on
with the current plan, which is to have the governor set electricity prices
behind closed doors, working with the very people who are suspected of 
unlawful
price fixing. PG&E's bankruptcy provides the governor with a new opportunity 
to
move to a more effective program.

??The governor should now stop using public funds to buy electricity. He 
should
urge Edison to join PG&E in reorganizing under bankruptcy court protection. 
This
will allow all parties to contest the unpaid billions of dollars of 
receivables
owed to the power producers and their associates. This will send a message to
Wall Street to stop funding such outrageous and predatory practices because 
they
don't pay.

??The state attorney general should conduct a criminal grand jury 
investigation
into the alleged wrongdoing by the power generators. He should also join in 
the
private litigation that asserts that the power producers violated the state's
antitrust laws. He should follow the investigative trail to Houston, Tulsa,
Atlanta and wherever else it leads.

??Finally, Californians are going to have to make a short-term sacrifice to 
get
a long-term gain. The governor's call last week for conservation does not go 
far
enough. Each city council and mayor and all boards of supervisors should be
required to come up with an emergency conservation plan. We need to cut
consumption to the point where we can meet it with current supply. We cannot 
put
an unfair burden on business because this will cost jobs. People with lower
incomes and fixed incomes need to be protected.

??PG&E's bankruptcy filing removes the foundation of the governor's plan. He
should remember the example of FDR, who likened himself to a football
quarterback who tries one play and, if it did not work, then tries another. 
But
for heaven's sake, try something. We must show our fellow citizens that we 
know
how to act effectively in solving this crisis.

HEADLINE: DAVIS ON POWER CRISIS

BODY:


??* Re "Davis Acknowledges Need for Rate Hike," April 6: But of course! While
the greed-monger electric producers get off scot-free to enjoy their obscene
profits and huge pay raises, we are told to conserve and pay more. Gov. Gray
Davis and the other politicos will sleep well, knowing that the energy 
industry
will have even more money to contribute to their campaigns, while we sleep not
at all.

??TRENT D. SANDERS

??Thursday night I was about to watch Gov. Davis' address on the power 
problem.
The announcer said, "We are going live to Sacramento," and the lights went 
out.
After sitting there in the dark for awhile, I decided this wasn't anything 
new.
There wasn't even a power alert in effect. Two hours later, after the lights
came back on, I did catch a repeat of his speech. That was nothing new either.

??The plan he ordered in mid-March to reward people who wasted power in the
past--by giving them a 20% reduction in their rate now for remembering to turn
the lights off--is unfair to those of us who have been conserving all along 
and
will get a rate increase for our efforts. We are being penalized for buying
those expensive, high-efficiency fluorescent lights.

??While Democrats continue to blame former Republican Gov. Pete Wilson, the
undisputed fact is that the problem is the result of California's population
growth. That growth is due entirely to immigration. If the liberals had not
overturned Proposition 187 back in 1994, we wouldn't be having these problems
now. Resurrecting it would help eliminate the problem.

??JOHN MESSINA

??Re "Probe of Utility Money Transfers Ordered," April 4: The PUC is wasting
time again. Instead of focusing on the problem they created with electricity
deregulation, they are now investigating the financial transactions between 
the
utilities and the parent companies. What can come of that review? Either
everything is OK, as the recent audits showed us. Or there is still a little
more money available to the utilities before they go bankrupt. Who cares?

??What we need to do is to deal with the problem. Energy costs far more to the
utilities than the PUC has so far allowed in rates. That difference is so very
large that even the state cannot afford to buy electricity without the recent
PUC rate increase, which is required to go directly to the state.

??Come on, PUC, deal with the real issues and do it before summer.

??THOMAS LONG

??Novato, Calif.


??*

??It's outrageous that the majority of the people of California continue to
face rolling blackouts and rate increases while the inhabitants of a few lucky
municipalities smugly roll along unaffected by the tragedy all around them.
Davis should immediately order the unaffected generators like the L.A.
Department of Water and Power, Glendale, Pasadena, Burbank and others to pool
all their power into the grid. There is no reason why these cities should be
exempt. This is a crisis for California. We are all in it together. It's only
fair that we share the burden.

HEADLINE: SHOCK'S SILVER LINING

BODY:


??That California's power crisis has been dealt another huge shock is not all
bad. The bankruptcy of Pacific Gas & Electric has legal scholars puzzling over
how federal court supervision of the debt-ridden utility will affect
rate-setting, sale of assets such as the transmission system and the state's
role in the crisis. And that's apart from figuring out how it affects Southern
California Edison, the chief private utility in the southern part of the 
state.
Despite executives' denials of any bankruptcy plans, will Edison be forced 
into
the same boat? Even with all these questions, a good shake can have benefits.

??There's no doubt that a federal bankruptcy judge has the power to sort out 
at
least some of the befuddling problems of the state's energy crisis. Few tears
will be shed, for instance, if a court-ordered restructuring of PG&E's debt
trimmed some of the outlandish profits reaped by private generating companies
that sold power to the utility over the past six months. Federal involvement
could also force the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to abandon its
hands-off stance on regulating wholesale prices. There is bipartisan support 
in
Congress for FERC to conduct a thorough investigation of the price spikes that
pushed the utilities into default and forced the state to spend billions as 
the
power purchaser of last resort.

??And what of the utilities themselves? PG&E's award of more than $ 50 million
in employee bonuses the day before it filed for bankruptcy was a terrible
political move, but it is not the jackpot issue. The utility's transfer of
billions of dollars to its parent company even as cash flow problems worsened
will be a more likely and fitting target of scrutiny by bankruptcy overseers.

??Not least, the shock of the bankruptcy may also convince Californians to 
take
urgent conservation action before the hot summer months. The state must also
expedite a $ 1-billion conservation program passed by the Legislature late 
last
week. No matter who is at fault, summer blackouts are a certainty unless both
business and residential customers take energy savings much more seriously.

??The bankruptcy certainly pulled the rug out from under Gov. Gray Davis, who
had been trying without success to make a deal with PG&E, Southern California 
Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric to buy their transmission systems in
exchange for state assistance with debts. Just Thursday night, Davis had 
bowed,
in a television address, to the necessity for big rate increases. He no doubt
meant to assure Californians that he was taking strong action to solve the
crisis and keep the utilities from bankruptcy, but he disappointingly offered 
no
new initiatives. In the clearest possible slap at Davis, PG&E was at the steps
of the Bankruptcy Court the next morning.

??However embarrassed Davis must have been by the sideswipe, he should not
allow anger to dictate his response. He needs to demonstrate he's above such
pettiness and perhaps even acknowledge that his snail's-pace progress was part
of the problem. Davis redoubled efforts over the weekend to strike a deal with
Edison for its part of the transmission system, but PG&E's bankruptcy 
certainly
complicates the transaction.

??Perhaps it was never possible to deal with the utilities' past debts and
restructure the state's power at the same time. Bankruptcy is a rough but
effective tool for dealing with debt, one that might help legislators and the
governor focus more sharply on future reforms.

??Much now depends on the federal bankruptcy judge, Dennis Montali, who is
known as an effective mediator able to persuade reluctant parties to settle.
California's economy has survived the power crisis so far, but it is not
endlessly resilient. If PG&E's bankruptcy speeds debt resolution and focuses 
the
governor and Legislature on reforming the state's power generation, 
transmission
and pricing systems, business will welcome any increase in predictability.

??Californians are starved for answers. The federal court's involvement,
despite the grave circumstances, could provide some.

Plenty of Failure to Go Around

BYLINE: GEORGE SKELTON



DATELINE: SACRAMENTO

BODY:


??It's doubtful any California governor ever has had such a slap in the face.

??Certainly not in the last 60 years. Probably never. Not by anybody but the
voters, at least.

??The man goes on statewide television to project leadership and instill
confidence. The next morning, one of the state's corporate giants files for
federal bankruptcy protection.

??"A lot of words," PG&E Chairman Robert D. Glynn Jr. said of Gov. Gray Davis'
long-awaited TV address. "We have not seen a lot of action."

??Of course, Glynn is playing his own finger-pointing politics, trying to 
shift
any personal blame for leading this 149-year-old institution into bankruptcy.
PG&E, after all, did push for the idiotic "deregulation" scheme that brought 
it
down. In 1997, Glynn hailed California's deregulation as "a huge opportunity 
for
consumers to lower their energy costs."

??The most disingenuous, self-denying finger-pointers are the Sacramento
politicians who passed, signed and delivered this debacle and now blame the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for soiling their creation. They accuse
FERC of ignoring federal law that requires it to make sure wholesale 
electricity
prices are "just" and "reasonable."

??It's true: FERC has allowed out-of-state power profiteers to loot California
and mug its private utilities. But it was the Sacramento pols--prodded by
campaign-contributing manufacturers and utilities--who unwittingly handed FERC
control over the price of power generated at California's gas-fired plants. 
They
weren't thinking then but are whining now.

??And we've got a once-proud company that serves 13 million
Californians--nearly 40% of the population--going belly up.


??*

??"Not since the bankruptcy of the Bank of California in 1875 has there been a
comparable corporate failure," says Kevin Starr, state librarian and 
historian.
"With a lineage that goes back to the 1850s, PG&E is more than a company. It 
is
a social institution significantly responsible for the creation of 
contemporary
California north of Fresno."

??The San Francisco-based Bank of California collapsed because of bad loans,
plummeting mining stocks and a sour national economy. Its failure set off a
panic and plunged San Francisco into a depression for the rest of the decade.

??"This thing is scary," Starr says.

??In January, Starr called the energy crisis "the greatest challenge any
governor has faced in 150 years . . . because it's pervasive. It affects every
sector of society."

??Moreover, it can't be resolved totally within the state Capitol. Energy
producers, utility execs, private financiers, FERC and now a bankruptcy judge
also wield power.

??So far, there has not only been a corporate failure--but also a 
gubernatorial
failure. It's not just because Davis set dual goals of avoiding a consumer 
rate
hike and utility bankruptcy and failed in both. It's also because the governor
has failed to earn the confidence of the legislators and interests he needs to
help him meet the challenge.

??He's increasingly seen as slow, timid and indecisive--and someone incapable
of developing the personal relationships necessary for difficult
coalition-building.

??"We need a wartime governor right now," says one influential Democratic
lawmaker. "A wartime governor seizes command and gives people confidence in
where he's going."


??*

??Davis has come to a fork in the road. And to quote the great Yogi Berra,
"When you come to a fork in the road, take it."

??One fork could lead to conciliation/appeasement--maybe tripling electricity
rates or borrowing tens of billions on the credit card. The other fork could
lead to confrontation/leadership.

??Mild-mannered Assemblyman Fred Keeley (D-Boulder Creek), chairman of the
Energy Committee, has a bold idea: If FERC won't cap exorbitant wholesale
prices, the governor should consider using his emergency power to seize
contracts between electricity generators and marketers. He'd have to pay "
reasonable value," but it would be substantially less than the wholesale 
prices
being inflicted on California by greedy marketers.

??This governor has immense power if he'll use it.

??So far, the public has not quit on Davis. But faith in him is waning. Recent
private polls have found only 23% to 36% of people saying they'd vote today to
reelect him.

??Government's main job is to protect the public, not only from muggers on the
corner, but also in the corporate suites. Californians have been slapped
around--and by Texas bullies, no less. Now, they see their governor being
slapped by PG&E.

??If they get disgusted enough, California voters might just slap Davis
themselves.

ENERGY: EVEN BEFORE PG&E FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY, ALTERNATIVE PLANT OWNERS WHO
HADN'T BEEN PAID IN MONTHS PURSUED COURT ACTIONS.

BYLINE: JULIE TAMAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER



DATELINE: SACRAMENTO

BODY:


??In filing for federal bankruptcy protection last week, Pacific Gas & 
Electric
Co. determined what other power producers had already concluded: The state had
failed to solve their payment problems and the time had come for the courts to
step in.

??In the days leading up to PG&E's Bankruptcy Court petition, a growing number
of alternative energy producers had also been filing lawsuits, seeking to be
freed from their contracts with PG&E and Southern California Edison. The
litigation was triggered in part by a controversial new rate plan imposed last
month by the state Public Utilities Commission in addition to millions of
dollars of debt owed to the producers by the utilities.

??On Tuesday, Dynamis Inc. filed suit in Fresno, saying PG&E owes it $ 3
million.

??Carson-based Watson Cogeneration Co., one of the state's largest alternative
energy producers, also had filed suit to have its contract with Edison
suspended. So did Delta Power, which owns five small gas-fired plants in
California. Both producers are owed tens of millions by Edison.

??At least a dozen such suits have been filed in civil courts, and lawyers 
warn
that more could be on the way.

??"Tough solutions were not being brought to the equation, which left PG&E and
others feeling they were better off in the court system," said Jerry Bloom, an
attorney for the California Cogeneration Council.

??The court actions come on the heels of an order by the PUC last month that
Edison and PG&E begin fully paying hundreds of small alternative energy
producers. But some producers say that a new rate plan issued by the PUC would
force them to operate at a loss and that nothing has been done to address the
about $ 1.5 billion owed to members of the group by PG&E and Edison.

??Lawyers say other producers have served Edison with notices that they plan 
to
cancel their contracts.

??Gas-fired generators account for about two-thirds of the electricity 
produced
by the alternative energy group.

??The California Independent System Operator, keeper of the state's power 
grid,
reports that there continues to be a roughly 3,000-megawatt reduction in 
output
from the alternative energy producers. The daily sum is enough power to 
supply 2
million to 3 million typical homes.

??"It clearly shows the problem hasn't been fixed," said Jan Smutny-Jones, 
executive director of the Independent Energy Producers. 

??California is home to nearly 700 producers of alternative and renewable
energy, which as a group provide more than a quarter of the electricity used 
by
consumers.

??Some of the producers have gone offline or reduced supplies for maintenance
reasons, but others have cut back because they have not been paid by Edison
since November or have received only partial payments from PG&E.

??The drop in output has at times forced the state to purchase replacement
supplies on the pricey spot market for electricity and contributed to rolling
blackouts last month. The latter event prompted Gov. Gray Davis to propose a
plan to get the generators up and running again.

??Consequently, the PUC established a new rate plan for the producers and
ordered the utilities to begin fully paying them beginning this month. The
payment goal would be accomplished in part by slashing the rates that PG&E and
Edison must pay the producers.

??But the PUC action appears to have compelled a growing number of gas-fired
generators to file lawsuits in an effort to be released from their contracts
with the utilities and be paid the millions they are owed.

??Bloom contends that the new rate plan will force some producers to operate 
at
a loss because it does not adequately compensate for their gas expenses. He 
said
he expects generators to challenge the plan in court or before the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission.

??Smutny-Jones contends that the plan wrongly assumes that all natural gas 
used
by his members can be piped in from the Oregon border, where the price of
natural gas is cheaper. The producers, he added, are seeking assurances that
they will be paid realistic rates by the utilities for future deliveries.

??Utilities are scheduled to pay the first round of reduced rates, as ordered
by the PUC, early next week. Both utilities have indicated that they plan to
make the first round of payments.

??Edison officials said Friday they have been served with 10 producer 
lawsuits.
They say they fear that if the generators are let out of their contracts, they
could sell their supplies out of state, which could in turn cause rates to 
rise
for California consumers because it would reduce supply.

??PG&E spokesman John Nelson said in an interview last week before the
bankruptcy filing that PG&E has been served with two such lawsuits. He said 
his
company is also concerned about the PUC rate plan and whether it truly lowered
the rates PG&E must pay the alternative producers and whether there would be
enough money in the rates paid by customers to turn around and pay the
producers.

??"We're concerned that the commission decision does not solve the problem,"
Nelson said.

??A Davis spokesman said last week that the administration is still working on
the issue of money owed to the producers and that the administration is
continuing to work with the PUC to get more generators back online.

??Observers believe the number of producer lawsuits will grow because most
cases to date have been aimed at Edison. The utility has not paid its 
producers
since November and has fought to have its rates slashed.

??By comparison, PG&E has made efforts to partially pay its producers in 
recent
months and to keep them informed of their financial situation.

??A Bankruptcy Court is expected to decide whether to affirm the contracts of
producers who sell to PG&E or to free them to sell their power elsewhere.

??An Imperial County judge has already freed CalEnergy, a small geothermal
producer, from its contract with Edison because of Edison's failure to pay the
company. The court has delayed ruling on CalEnergy's request for $ 99 million 
in
back payments until April 16--the day the utility is expected to begin paying
its alternative generators.

??Since it quit transmitting 270 megawatts to Edison last month, CalEnergy has
been selling its electricity to El Paso Energy, a marketing company that 
resells
power on the spot market. If other generators are able to repeat the pattern, 
it
could further reduce state energy supplies, particularly this summer, when 
every
megawatt will be needed to avoid blackouts.

ENERGY: MUCH OF THE NATION IS ALREADY BEING ZAPPED BY DOUBLE-DIGIT INCREASES.
SEVERAL STATES HAVE HIGHER RATES. DEREGULATION, ANTI-POLLUTION LAWS AND 
DISTANCE
FROM FUEL SOURCES ARE TO BLAME.

BYLINE: ERIC SLATER, TIMES STAFF WRITER



DATELINE: CHICAGO

BODY:


??For all its energy notoriety and outrage over surging electricity rates,
California has plenty of company. Much of the nation faces double-digit price
hikes, and several states--especially in the East--continue to pay more for
electricity than California. 

??Not even Gov. Gray Davis' reluctant proposal last week to kick rates up as
much as 34.5% for the heaviest residential users would guarantee California 
the
dubious honor of having the priciest electricity in the United States.

??Overshadowed by the rhetoric, lawsuits and rolling blackouts is the fact 
that
Californians have been paying less for electricity than residents in Rhode
Island, New Hampshire, Vermont, New York, Alaska and, by a longshot, Hawaii.
California, in fact, is barely in the top 10 when it comes to electrical 
prices.

??One of the reasons that Californians have been paying less is because they
conserve more, with the average resident draining 40% less from the grid than
the average American.

??Another reason, however, is that California's rates have been frozen by law,
even as the lids have been coming off the prices in other states that are
deregulating their utilities.

??"I don't know about you guys," said state Sen. Sheila Kuehl (D-Santa Monica)
at a hearing last week in Sacramento, "but my constituents don't think they
suffered over the past several years because their rates didn't go up 45% and
50% the way they did in New York and Pennsylvania and other parts of this
country."

??These dramatic price spikes are driven by a strange, worst-case confluence 
of
electrical-world forces.

??A drought in the Northwest means that there's not enough water to turn the
turbines in the great hydroelectric dams; massive price increases for natural
gas come even as the country is moving toward more natural gas-powered
electrical generators; and the deregulation of utilities--left largely up to
individual states--has proved more complicated than almost anyone dreamed.

??"We look at it as a perfect storm," Rep. Jay Inslee (D-Wash.) said of the
improbably bad stew of circumstances.

??In Boston, residential users face a possible 23% hike, industrial customers
69%. In Cheyenne, Wyo., some residential customers are insulating themselves
against possible hikes of 57%, with some commercial customers looking at an 
88%
jump. In Idaho, they're talking hikes of between 34% and 63% for some 
customers.
In Nevada, rate hikes scheduled at more than 1% a month, starting in September
and continuing until September 2003, will raise residential rates about 75%.

??All this after two decades of steadily declining electricity rates in the
U.S.--with almost all of the price drops preceding the deregulation that was
supposed to bring down prices.

??Price of Power Fell Steadily for Years

??In the early 1980s, one kilowatt hour of power cost residential customers
about a dime. Over the next two decades, Americans began to employ more
energy-efficient appliances, computers, even lightbulbs, and utilities 
produced
their power more and more efficiently.

??At the same time, utilities took advantage of low interest rates to help
retire massive debt incurred during the high-cost, post-Chernobyl building of
nuclear reactors, and they were thus able to pass on further savings to
customers.

??By last year, buying a kilowatt hour set the average American back just 7.5
cents.

??The trend has suddenly stopped.

??In a forecast released Friday, the Energy Information Administration 
predicts
that a kilowatt hour will cost about 8 cents on average nationally by the end 
of
this year and rise another half-cent in 2002.

??"For the first time in a long time, the prices are going up," said
administration forecaster Neil Gamson.

??A one-cent increase in the price per kilowatt hour would boost the monthly
bill of a typical California residential customer by about $ 10, to $ 117. For
big industrial users, the extra monthly cost could be in the thousands.

??Substantial regional differences have always existed, with the Northeast the
longtime home of the highest prices in the continental U.S. Some Northeastern
customers pay twice as much, or more, than consumers 3,000 miles due west.

??One reason is that, although environmental laws in the Northeast are
typically less stringent than those in California and the Northwest, growing
concerns and tougher anti-pollution legislation have forced utilities to shift
away from the higher-polluting coal-powered generators and toward
cleaner-burning natural gas. The environmentally conscious move has left them,
like several other areas, vulnerable to the recent price spikes of natural 
gas.

??The Northeast is also farther from most major sources of fuel, including
natural gas, oil and coal.

??Several states in the Northeast, including Connecticut, Maine, New 
Hampshire,
New York and Massachusetts, are actively deregulating. Like California, only
with less drama, they are finding the birth of a free market painful and
expensive.

??Under Massachusetts' deregulation statute, the standard retail rate for a
kilowatt hour was fixed at an average of just over 9 cents through 2005.
However, the rise in natural gas prices has left utilities pleading with
regulators to allow them to raise prices, lest they face California's problem 
of
selling their power at a loss--precisely the circumstance that led the Pacific
Gas & Electric Co. of San Francisco to declare bankruptcy Friday.

??Kilowatt Hour's Average Cost Rising

??Earlier this month, the Massachusetts Electric Co. got the go-ahead to 
charge
270,000 residential customers an additional 23%. Statewide, analysts say, the
average price of a kilowatt hour is probably edging up from its already high
October figure, the last available, of 11.2 cents.

??In New York, the average cost of a kilowatt hour statewide was 14.1 cents in
October. However, even under a deregulation plan that won't fully free the
utilities from price controls until 2002, some New York City residents have 
seen
their rates rise by nearly 20%, to 13.9 cents a kilowatt hour, in recent 
months.

??Still, Cornell University economist Tim Mount said he would be surprised and
"very disappointed if we mess things up in the East as badly as they messed it
up in California. I think the regulators thought that it would be easy to run 
a
market, and they didn't allow for very much malfeasance" on the part of newly
untethered utilities or private power generators.

??The South, with its coal reserves, has long hovered in the relatively cheap
range of 6 to 8 cents per kilowatt hour and, along with the Midwest, is likely
to be among the most stable areas in the near future.

??Several states in the South and Midwest are also among the last to consider
deregulation--for the very reason that their power is already cheap--and so 
may
benefit the most from studying the daily jolt of news out of California. 

??The Midwest has, as with so many things, been a picture of moderation when 
it
comes to electrical rates. A kilowatt hour goes for 7 to 8 cents or, in the 
case
of Illinois, a bit over 9 cents. (Chicago, the country's third-largest city 
and
the location of several infamous--although localized--blackouts in 1999, tends
to raise the state's average considerably.)

??Having continued to build power plants when states in the West and East had
all but halted construction, and with Illinois home to 11 price-stabilizing
nuclear reactors, the Midwest is expected to hold the line, at least in the 
near
future.

??The Northwest, long the land of cheap, clean hydroelectric power, is already
beginning to see its 5- and 6-cent electric rates climb.

??Many of the utilities in the Northwest receive huge portions of their juice
from the Bonneville Power Administration, which oversees 29 dams in the 
Columbia
and Snake River basins and provides 45% of the region's electricity.

??However, the severity of the region's drought--and the accompanying
electricity shortage--was illustrated last week when the BPA announced that it
would stop spilling precious water over its dams to help the spring salmon 
run.

??Announcing the news to residents who for decades have fought to restore
salmon runs decimated by the dams was perhaps made a bit easier for acting BPA
administrator Steve Wright because he had previously made another 
announcement.
The BPA, Wright said, would likely be raising its own wholesale rates from 95%
to 200% come October.

??Some of the rate hikes around the country are surcharges, meant to fill
utility coffers left empty by the leap in natural gas prices, for example. 
Many
others, however, are viewed as permanent. In the West, especially, there is
simply no reason to believe that costs will drop any time soon.

??The bankruptcy move Friday by PG&E only solidified that widely held opinion.
Among its other worries, Bonneville has been holding a $ 100-million IOU from
California utilities--half of it owed by PG&E--and hoping that money would 
help
to mitigate its rate hikes to other customers.

??When PG&E became the biggest utility in U.S. history to seek bankruptcy
protection, BPA became just another creditor likely to lose money.

HEADLINE: JUDGE IN PG&E BANKRUPTCY CASE SEEN AS A PROBLEM SOLVER;

COURTS: DENNIS MONTALI WILL FACE UNPRECEDENTED LEGAL COMPLEXITIES.

BYLINE: MAURA DOLAN, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER



DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

BODY:


??U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali, who will oversee Pacific Gas & 
Electric
Co.'s bankruptcy reorganization, is a highly respected scholar and effective
mediator known for persuading reluctant parties to reach agreement.

??In a recent case, Montali achieved in only three days a settlement between a
debtor and creditors in the bankruptcy of an international engineering firm. 
The
case had been in bruising litigation for two years when another judge asked
Montali to mediate it.

??As a lawyer, Montali helped divert a statewide agricultural crisis 10 years
ago by persuading warring factions to accept a deal in the bankruptcy of an
agricultural cooperative, according to a lawyer in the case.

??"He is very good at not embarrassing people but getting them to understand
they are wrong," said lawyer Larry Engel, who has known and worked with 
Montali
for two decades.

??Montali, 60, the son of a winemaker, grew up in San Francisco and now lives
in Berkeley. He is considered among the top tier of bankruptcy experts in the
United States.

??He will be calling the shots in one of the largest bankruptcy 
reorganizations
in U.S. history. The case raises unprecedented legal questions and is expected
to make new law. Some of the legal disputes may wind up before the U.S. 
Supreme
Court, attorneys said.

??Lawyers who know the easygoing, witty judge say he is probably relishing 
this
legal challenge the way a golfer looks forward to playing a new and more
difficult course. The court action begins today, when Montali is expected to
decide whether PG&E can spend cash that others have laid claims to.

??Right from the beginning, Montali will be in the limelight, and lawyers will
be eagerly searching for any clues to his leanings. Montali declined to be
interviewed, but those who know him say he is fair, smart, hard-working and
thoughtful. He does not browbeat, but quietly negotiates to bring people 
around,
lawyers said.

??The judge is highly engaged in his cases. He is well prepared, 
intellectually
curious and knows the hard questions to ask, lawyers said. He also is a
relatively quick decision-maker, frequently ruling from the bench.

??"Reality tends to come out" in his courtroom because Montali does not allow
lawyers to evade his questions, Engel said.

??There are few precedents to guide Montali in many of the novel legal
questions he is likely to be asked to rule upon. Can he order electricity rate
hikes? The law is unclear. Can he force energy suppliers to hold down their
prices? Doubtful, bankruptcy lawyers said. Can he force PG&E's parent company 
to
cough up some money? Possibly. Can he force PG&E to sell off assets? Yes, but
probably not in the near term.

??"This is going to be one of these cases where the envelope is going to be
pushed, and I think there is a danger in making any categorical statements 
right
now," said a bankruptcy lawyer who is involved in the case.

??PG&E's Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization will be enormously complex
legally, lawyers said. Montali will have to reconcile state utility law and
federal energy law with bankruptcy law. Bankruptcy judges have broad 
discretion
to decide disputes, and Montali will control PG&E's purse strings.

??Lawyers who know Montali well say he is savvy about using the Internet to
communicate court information, masters arcane legal subjects quickly, and
probably is thrilled to be making the calls in a case that will be watched
nationally.

??Some people go on the bench to retire. Montali went on in 1993 to have more
fun intellectually, lawyers said.

??Montali "tends to be very constructive," said another lawyer who asked not 
to
be identified by name because he may represent a creditor in the PG&E case. 
"He
wants his cases to go somewhere, and he tries to encourage people to make
progress."

??Before he was appointed to the bench, Montali had practiced bankruptcy law
for more than two decades. He began representing debtors but was doing 
primarily
creditor work in his last law firm job with the city's venerable Pillsbury,
Madison & Sutro.

??The bankruptcy bar he was a part of is relatively small, and the lawyers who
practice it know one another. Several lawyers interviewed about Montali 
referred
to him by his first name.

??Because these lawyers are likely to be players together in many cases over
the years, trustworthiness is important, bankruptcy attorneys said.
Effectiveness requires that other members of the bar trust your word and
credibility.

??The practice also requires knowledge of economics and economic terms, ease
both with deal making and trial work, and above all else, practicality, 
lawyers
said.

??Whereas a business litigator may know exactly what he or she will be doing
two months from now, bankruptcy lawyers tend to operate on tight deadlines 
with
little notice. Many of these lawyers were at their desks over the weekend
preparing for the PG&E case.

??"There is no one in town who is not part of this case," said Engel, who is
representing a municipal utility. "Everyone is involved."

??Montali is tall, lanky and balding. His trademark is his handlebar mustache,
which he has worn for decades and which reflects his gregariousness and humor,
other lawyers said. He cooks Italian food expertly and likes to sail around 
San
Francisco Bay and walk his dog during his time away from work. His wife, Mary,
is in the real estate business, and they have three grown daughters.

??As a lawyer, Montali was masterful at bringing about a compromise in the
bankruptcy of a major agricultural cooperative a decade ago, Engels said. At 
the
time the co-op went bankrupt, farmers had picked their crops, but there was no
money to operate the canneries and no money to pay the growers. Montali was
representing a bank in the case.

??"We could have had a disaster," Engel said. "Literally, imagine if 5,000
farmers lost their entire crop because there was nobody to take it. Each of 
them
would have gone into bankruptcy."

??The parties locked themselves together in one place for a week and half.
Montali was "at the core of it," Engel said. He persuaded all parties to agree
to a plan that involved selling the cooperative. "He would take someone who 
was
being a problem over to the side and explain that it wasn't going to work if
they persisted that way," Engel said.

??"He is the ultimate reasonable man who convinced them that this path is the
one they needed to be on in their own self-interest."

??Richard Levin, a Los Angeles bankruptcy lawyer, said Montali has "tremendous
integrity." As a lawyer, he was cogent and forceful in arguments and would 
make
simple, clear statements that would cause everyone in the courtroom to pause 
and
think, Levin said.

??Montali earned a bachelor's degree in English from Notre Dame University and
then entered the Navy to fulfill a Reserve Officer's Training Corps 
commitment.

??He served in various officer positions on two destroyers and taught briefly
at the United States Navy Reserve Officers Candidate School in Newport, R.I.,
before entering law school. He obtained his law degree from UC Berkeley's 
Boalt
Hall School of Law in 1968.

??Montali has been elected to the National Bankruptcy Conference and the
American College of Bankruptcy, both elite bodies reserved for those at the 
top
of their field.

??Last year, he was appointed to hear appeals in bankruptcy cases for the U.S.
9th Circuit Court of Appeals in addition to his trial duties.

??One of his first cases on the bench ended in disaster. Shortly after he
became a judge, he ruled in favor of a landlord who was trying to evict a
tenant. The tenant had a bankruptcy case before Montali.

??The tenant later went to the landlord's office, shot and killed him, wounded
the landlord's son and tried to kill himself.

??"I didn't have any regret about the decision," Montali told the Daily
Journal, a legal newspaper, several years ago. "But it reinforced in the real
world that I'm making decisions that affect people. It put some real meaning
into things."

??In 1997, Montali ruled that a gay man was liable for damages because he
failed to warn his former lover that he was infected with HIV before they had
unprotected sex.

??The case had wound up before Montali because the defendant filed for
bankruptcy to avoid paying monetary damages if he lost the sexual battery
lawsuit.

HEADLINE: THINK TANK HIRES EXPERTS WITH POWER TO SOLVE PROBLEMS DURING ENERGY
CRISIS

BYLINE: MARGARET TALEV, TIMES STAFF WRITER



DATELINE: CAMARILLO

BODY:


??A retired publisher of energy trade magazines has established a think tank 
at
Cal State Channel Islands to tackle electricity problems.

??The timing of Gold Coast Innovation Center's opening at the developing 
campus
could hardly be better. Area businesses, governments and residents are bracing
for average rate increases of 26.5% and an estimated 34 days of rolling
blackouts this summer.

??Founder Myron Miller's long-term vision is to help everyone from
international business executives to villagers in third-world countries. But 
in
the wake of the state's power crisis, the 71-year-old Oxnard man expects many 
of
the calls he'll field will be more along these lines:

??* A company or local government could be devastated by rolling blackouts
unless it purchases a good backup power system--soon.

??* A homeowner fed up with rising rates is thinking of dropping off the grid
and going exclusively to solar power.

??* A farmer wonders whether all the plant or animal waste his operations
produce could be harnessed to power his own water pumps and coolers.

??Miller said he and his staff may know the answers, and if they don't, 
they'll
put callers in touch with experts who can help.

??Though in its infancy, the nonprofit center has big plans. And already it's
drawing attention.

??"There's an absolute need for this," said Rohit Shukla, chief executive of
Larta, a Los Angeles-based technology alliance. "There's nothing quite like 
this
anywhere in California."

??Don Gunderson, president of the Economic Development Collaborative of 
Ventura
County, agreed. "They couldn't be coming on line at a better time."

??California's energy crisis hadn't hit when Miller began planning the center
two years ago. Having just sold PCIM Power Electronic Systems Magazine and 
Power
Quality Magazine, however, he was looking for a project that would allow him 
to
remain a player among engineers and entrepreneurs he'd met throughout the 
world
during his quarter-century in publishing.

??"There was some unfinished business," said Miller, who was trained as a
chemist. "There are so many challenges."

??He conceived of a research and networking group that could bring together
industry experts from the United States, Germany, Japan, Mexico and other
countries to address power concerns that translate across continents in a 
world
increasingly linked by telecommunications and vulnerable to power shortages 
and
interruptions.

??He also drew on local contacts, including John Mungenast, a nationally
recognized power electronics engineer, and Mike Shaw, manager of the design 
and
reliability department at Rockwell Science Center in Thousand Oaks.

??Miller envisioned a center where experts collaborate on ways to minimize
electrical surges and dips, a center that could spur research on alternative
fuel sources and serve as a small incubator for energy-related start-up
companies. The center also could provide Cal State and other area university
students with hands-on experience in the field.

??Finally, the group could advise individual companies on what alternative
power sources or energy-saving devices might work best for them--and put them 
in
touch with people who design and manufacture such products.

??Miller donated $ 300,000 toward the center, most of which went to renovating
12,000 square feet at the university campus. He assembled a 17-member advisory
board and brought in a director, Steve Herman, a former Litton executive who
recently ran a technology association in Oregon.

??The center hopes to sustain itself through a combination of grants, and
contracts with private industry.

??By the time Gold Coast opened its doors in February, the state's energy
problems had become a crisis and Herman figured that would dominate the 
center's
work for months to come.

??In recent weeks, local business groups such as Gunderson's Ventura County
collaborative have called on Herman to speak to their members. Herman said
county and Camarillo government officials also have had some preliminary talks
with him.

OTHERS LEARNING FROM CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY MISTAKES

BYLINE: JAMES FLANIGAN



BODY:


??For all the agony and anger about energy in California, compounded now by 
the
bankruptcy filing of Pacific Gas & Electric, deregulation and the 
transformation
of the electric power industry is moving forward nationwide--and worldwide.

??Many electric companies elsewhere are thriving and being recommended by
investment analysts even as the regulated utility division of PG&E Corp.
surrenders its management to a bankruptcy court and Southern California 
Edison,
a subsidiary of Edison International, remains under heavy threat of being 
forced
to do the same.

??Companies and regulators everywhere cite California's troubles as stemming
from mistakes they will avoid.

??For example, American Electric Power, a Columbus, Ohio-based leader of the
utility industry, told shareholders in its annual report that California's 
blunders of "insufficient power supplies, total reliance on spot pricing and
capping of rates for retail consumers even as costs of wholesale power
multiplied, are not likely to be replicated elsewhere."

??Indeed, many of deregulation's dangers may be avoided now simply because
California and PG&E have put everybody on their guard.

??California's horrible example has spurred recognition that power plants need
to be built.

??And PG&E's collapse sends a message that utility companies operating partly
in regulated and unregulated environments need to separate their accounts so 
as
to better understand the different businesses they are managing.

??Wall Street sees electricity as a growth industry just because power is in
relative short supply in many parts of the country.

??"The United States has not built enough power plants over the last 10 years
to meet demand," says analyst Brian Youngberg of Edward Jones & Co., a St.
Louis-based investment company.

??That spells opportunity for companies able to produce low-cost power and
market it in different regions.

??Promising Investment

??Today's favored utilities are those moving to acquire power plants and sell
power as an unregulated commodity in different areas, even as they cope with
deregulation and competition in their home territories.

??The examples of two leading companies will explain a lot about the utility
business today, why investors regard it as promising and how companies and 
state
regulators elsewhere are taking steps to avoid the blunders of California. 

??Utilicorp United, based in Kansas City, Mo., is the modern outgrowth of a
family-owned electric company dating to 1902. Under Richard Green, the 
founder's
great-grandson who has been chief executive since 1982, Utilicorp went eagerly
into wholesale marketing and trading of electricity around the world, 
acquiring
companies in Australia and New Zealand, even as it continued to operate
regulated utilities in Missouri--where electricity remains regulated--and six
other Midwestern states.

??Utilicorp, helped by the growth of its Aquila Energy subsidiary that trades
electricity contracts, has expanded to $ 29 billion in revenue in 2000 from 
just
over $ 1 billion a decade ago. "I've got two companies," Green says, "one is a
regulated utility, growing 3% to 5% a year and paying a dividend, and the 
other
is Aquila, which is growing 20% a year."

??So he is separating the two, issuing stock in 19.9% of Aquila now and
intending to spin it off as an independent company within a year. "Investors 
can
then have their choice of growth or stability and dividends," Green says.

??American Electric Power is a venerable pioneer of the utility industry. It
originated the practice of siting power plants atop coal mines so the fuel 
could
be transferred efficiently to the steam turbine boilers.

??Now its home state of Ohio is going through a three-year process of
deregulating electricity. So AEP is going aggressively into wholesale
electricity generation and marketing.

??Last year it acquired Dallas-based Central & Southwest Co. and now markets 
in
Texas, Louisiana and Oklahoma as well as its traditional bases in Ohio and
Michigan.

??AEP, too, is going to separate its unregulated and regulated businesses.

??It's doing this, the company told shareholders, because "it will enable
investors to value our businesses separately and will improve our ability to
manage the realities of electric deregulation and to focus on the differing
capital requirements of each business."

??Why is that significant? Because PG&E, the holding company that owns Pacific
Gas & Electric, also has thriving energy trading and out-of-state electricity 
operations within its corporate structure.

??It built up the unregulated business in recent years by transferring 
proceeds
from sales of California power plants and cash flow accruing from the state's
complex deregulation scheme.

??But PG&E didn't separate the unregulated and regulated businesses for
shareholders. And now PG&E's publicly traded stock has lost 77% of its value 
and
the company faces a battle in bankruptcy court to keep its unregulated assets
out of the hands of creditors.

??Avoiding Mistakes

??As companies elsewhere try to avoid PG&E's errors, so other states take 
pains
not to make California's big mistake of going into deregulation without a
reserve of electric generating capacity. Ohio is making sure that it has a
surplus of generating capacity.

??The Northeastern states of Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Hampshire and
Rhode Island, which have deregulated, also have plenty of spare capacity,
reports Cambridge Energy Research Associates.

??With electricity in surplus, those states and regions can encourage price
competition in electricity. But when there are shortages, as began to occur 
last
year in California, desperation buying by customers and price gouging by
suppliers are all but inevitable.

??A point to keep in mind in the wake of California's disaster and PG&E's
downfall is that the electric utility industry and the U.S. system are at the
outset of a long process of transformation.

??It's not unlike the telephone business that has changed so much in the last
30 years, starting from, say, the rise of MCI in the 1970s or the breakup of
AT&T Corp. in 1984.

??Yet those years also saw the rise of whole new technologies and new
companies, even as giants of another age faded and failed.

??California and California companies may yet find success in this new age of
opportunity--and peril--for electricity.

HEADLINE: Governor, Utility In War Of Words;

Davis furious as PG&E defends bankruptcy filing

SOURCE: Chronicle Staff Writer

BYLINE: David Lazarus

BODY:
California's energy mess took an ugly turn yesterday as Gov. Gray Davis and
Pacific Gas and Electric Co. traded barbs over who is to blame for the
bankruptcy of the state's largest utility.

???In a series of tit-for-tat statements, each side laid claim to the moral
high ground while insisting that the other had been dealing in bad faith.

???The governor spent part of his time yesterday giving television interviews
in response to The Chronicle's report Saturday that PG&E awarded $50 million 
in
bonuses and raises to 6,000 employees just hours before Friday's bankruptcy
filing.

???"PG&E's management is suffering from two afflictions: denial and greed,"
Davis said in a brief statement Saturday night.

???In a testy reply, PG&E countered that "instead of focusing all his 
attention
on solving the state's yearlong and ever-worsening energy crisis, the governor
has launched a campaign-style attack on our company."

???PG&E said Davis was criticizing "thousands of men and women who have worked
tirelessly and professionally through this crisis" and concluded that
"California would be far better served if the governor turned his attention to
the crisis at hand."

???Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for the governor, fired back yesterday: "PG&E
waged a public relations war on Friday. If they're looking for somebody to
blame, they should look in the mirror."

???Maviglio also said the governor was concentrating on reaching a final 
accord
with Southern California Edison Co. for the state to purchase the 
cash-strapped
company's power lines for nearly $2.8 billion.

???A last round of talks was scheduled to be held last night.

???"There are a few remaining details to be worked out, but it seems pretty
close," Maviglio said, adding that an announcement of the deal could come as
early as today.

???"The governor is spending his time negotiating with a responsible utility,"
he said.

???Along with the Edison deal, Davis spent the weekend huddling with energy
advisers and lawyers trying to come up with an appropriate response to PG&E's
bankruptcy bombshell.

???Efforts to stabilize California's dysfunctional electricity market suddenly
have become much more complex.

???NOT MUCH CHANGED

???Nevertheless, while PG&E's bankruptcy is by far the most sensational aspect
of California's long-drawn-out energy mess, at the end of the day, it doesn't
really change a thing.

???Consider:

???-- PG&E's financial woes stem from a rate freeze that prevented the utility
from passing along to customers runaway wholesale power costs. That rate 
freeze
and sky-high electricity prices remain in place.

???-- California's energy shortage is primarily the result of the state not
having built any major power plants for the past 12 years. PG&E's bankruptcy
does nothing to affect that precarious situation.

???-- PG&E's foray into bankruptcy court does not alter the fact that
electricity demand is outpacing available supply. California consumers still
face a threat of daily blackouts when power usage spikes this summer.

???"The crux of the problem is still the same," said Loretta Lynch, president
of the state Public Utilities Commission. "We face the same challenges we did
before PG&E filed for bankruptcy."

???She added, however, that PG&E's bankruptcy "increases the uncertainty."

???The utility doesn't see it that way.

???PG&E spokesman Ron Low said California's energy woes are no more uncertain
now than they were when the company ostensibly was negotiating with Davis to
find an equitable solution to the state's troubles.

???"California remains in an energy crisis," he said. "As we head toward
summer, resources are going to be very tight."

???WHAT COULD HAPPEN

???In the short run, consumers will notice no change whatsoever. Bankruptcy
protection will allow PG&E to continue operating as usual while the company's
creditors line up to receive at least partial payment of outstanding bills.

???Longer term, there is a very real possibility that electricity rates will
soar if the bankruptcy judge agrees with PG&E that conditions for lifting the
rate freeze were met a year ago and that $9 billion in subsequent expenses 
must
be borne by consumers.

???How much people's bills would rise depends on how the rate increase is
structured. It would probably come in the form of a surcharge on existing 
fees,
but the monthly hit to consumers could be limited by spreading the total cost
over a number of years.

???The big question mark now is how PG&E's bankruptcy will affect various
political and legislative measures intended to keep California's lights on.

???The state's attempt to purchase PG&E's power lines is obviously finished,
although a new deal could be negotiated in bankruptcy court.

???Meanwhile, the governor is pressing ahead with plans to purchase the
transmission systems of Edison and Sempra Energy's San Diego utility -- 
although
what the state would do with only a partial power grid has yet to be 
determined.

???"Does it make any sense to have the transmission lines of Edison and Sempra
and not PG&E?" asked state Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San
Francisco. "I don't know the answer to that."

???A final accord with Edison this week would validate PG&E's apparent 
concerns
that it would have had a harder time limiting backlash to its bankruptcy 
filing
if the utility had acted after a breakthrough with Edison was unveiled.

???The Chronicle quoted PG&E insiders yesterday as saying that the decision to
file for bankruptcy had been made early last week, even though senior company
officials said the move followed the governor's Thursday night speech on 
solving
California's energy issues.

???One reason PG&E opted to file on Friday morning was because a final deal
with Edison was expected at any time, observers said.

???Paul Patterson, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, noted that if 
PG&E
had filed for bankruptcy after Edison came to terms with the state, "they 
would
be seen as a spoiler."

???ENSUING CONFUSION

???In any case, PG&E's surprise filing has left all concerned scrambling for
footing in the changed political landscape.

HEADLINE: Power Grab -- Some Democrats Favor Seizing Plants

SOURCE: Chronicle Staff Writer

BYLINE: Bernadette Tansey

BODY:
With the prospect that state power buyers could burn through more than $2
billion a month this summer, some state Democratic leaders are pushing for a
takeover of private power plants to get soaring prices under control.

???Lawmakers concede that sending state agents to grab the keys of power
generating plants would be an extraordinary measure.

???But now that Pacific Gas and Electric Co. has limited the state's options
with Friday's bankruptcy filing and with little hope for stronger federal 
price
controls, state Senate leader John Burton and others say seizing power plants
makes financial and political sense.

???They say they've done the math: Since January, California has spent more
than $4 billion buying power. That's about $1 billion more than private energy
firms paid for the power plants PG&E and California's two other investor-owned
utilities were













???forced to sell under California's botched deregulation plan. At those 
rates,
California could soon look like a renter paying the full value of the house
several times a year.

???Profits of 300 percent are not uncommon for large private generators, which
provide about 40 percent of the state's power needs. The state could seize the
assets, compensate the companies and then sell the electricity to consumers at
cost, advocates of the plan say.

???"We have to do something," said Burton, D-San Francisco, one of a group of
legislators who urged Davis at a meeting last week to condemn some of the
plants. "These people have got us by the throat. They're making more money 
than
God, and we've got to fight back -- not with words, but with actions."

???Davis himself raised the specter of using his emergency powers to take over
power plants with a fiery flourish during his State of the State address 
earlier
this year.

???"If I have to use the power of eminent domain to prevent generators from
driving consumers into the dark and utilities into bankruptcy, then that's 
what
I will do," he said in January.

???Davis still hasn't ruled out the possibility, but he says it's not high on
his list of tactics.

???Generators say they would fight tooth and nail against such a grab, and
state GOP lawmakers oppose condemnation, saying it smacks of underdeveloped
countries' nationalizing key industries.

???But Burton and other Democrats, including state Senators Don Perata,
D-Oakland, and Jackie Speier, D-Hillsborough, say the governor's strategy so 
far
has left giant energy firms holding all the cards -- and a mounting pile of 
the
state's cash.

???Davis had been trying to restore the financial stability of PG&E and
Southern California Edison after their combined $14 billion debt for 
electricity
purchases so damaged their creditworthiness that the state had to take over
buying power.

???But now that PG&E has sought bankruptcy protection rather than accept 
Davis'
plan to buy its transmission lines, the state may be stuck with the role of
power buyer for years.

???POWERS OF EMINENT DOMAIN

???Sacramento lawyer Richard Desmond, an expert on state powers of eminent
domain, said California could seize generating plants by demonstrating that it
would put the properties to "a higher and more necessary use."

???"The government has almost unlimited power of eminent domain to acquire
property," Desmond said. "The only thing the state has to do is pay 'just
compensation,' as defined under the constitution."

???The state could file a formal suit for eminent domain, a time-consuming
procedure if the owner mounts a fierce resistance over the transfer price,
Desmond said. If the state wants to take immediate possession, it can deposit 
an
estimate of the just compensation and fight it out later in court. But if the
state loses, it could be stuck for interest, litigation costs and damages.

???Condemnation of power plants would raise a number of unknowns, such as
figuring out who would manage and operate the facilities. The state might also
be put into the position of having to seize contracts between the generators 
and
natural gas providers.

???Davis spokesman Roger Salazar said the governor's first priority was
building new plants to increase supply, rather than condemning existing 
plants.

???State Sen. Jim Battin, R-Palm Desert, said he thought seizing plants was a
horrible idea.

???"We would become a third world country and start nationalizing things,"
Battin said. "Nobody would ever build a power plant in California again. I 
think
that would be a really bad play."

???COMPANY WOULD FIGHT

???Tom Williams, a spokesman for Duke Energy, said the company would fight
vigorously to protect its multimillion-dollar investment in four California
plants, including Morro Bay and Moss Landing.

???"We would defend our interest and seek a fair market value," Williams said.
Duke spent $611 million to buy or lease the four plants since 1998, and has
embarked on a $1.6 billion program to upgrade and expand them.

???Some power companies, however, may find their claims for the fair market
value of their plants undercut by their own tax filings. Energy firms, 
including
Duke, told county assessors last year that the utility plants they bought were
worth hundreds of millions of dollars less than they paid for them.

???Private companies including Duke, Dynegy, Southern Energy, AES Corp and
Calpine spent a total of $3.2 billion to buy divested utility power plants 
that
can produce as much as 20,000 megawatts.

???UNDERLYING PROBLEM UNSOLVED

???Williams said taking over the property of private companies would not solve
the underlying problem behind California's high energy prices: rising demand 
and
an inadequate supply of energy to fill it.

???Even if Davis seized only one plant, the move might spur other power
generators to drop their prices, said Doug Heller of the Foundation for 
Taxpayer
and Consumer Rights.

???"As soon as the generators recognize we're ready to go to a public power
system and take their plants, they may start selling power at reasonable 
rates,
and we won't have to go down that road," Heller said.Chronicle staff writers

HEADLINE: Lights Dim On Gray Davis

BYLINE: Marc Sandalow

BODY:
IF POLITICAL capital were traded on the open market, Gov. Gray Davis might 
have
beat PG&E in declaring bankruptcy Friday.Once regarded as a top tier 
Democratic
challenger to President Bush in the 2004 election, Davis national reputation 
is
suffering the electoral equivalent of a rolling blackout.It hardly matters 
that
it was an electricity deregulation scheme approved by a Republican legislature
and signed by a Republican governor who created the current mess.Americas
introduction to the man the New York Times mistakenly referred to as Mr. Gray 
is
as the governor who couldnt keep the lights on.Who killed the lights? sang 
five
men, not so subtly dressed in gray shirts, gray slacks and gray hats at
Washington Gridiron Club My partys over.Campaign and Elections magazine places
him as a 40-1 longshot to win the presidency, and that was before the 
governors
tepid performance of the past couple of weeks.As Washington residents will 
tell
you, a politician can smoke crack and survive (ask Marion Barry.) But heaven
help him if he fails to clean the streets after a snowstorm.Davis supporters
shrug off the political damage to a lifelong public servant who has many times
overcome long odds. Indeed, it was as hard for many veteran political 
observers
to believe that the uninspiring official who toiled in the back rooms of
California politics for two decades was a player on the national stage.But 
there
he was. By virtue of his stunning victory in the 1998 governors race in a 
state
that will soon hold 55 electoral votes, Davis was on most everyones list of
Democratic presidential contenders. ?Davis hosted a lavish coming out party 
for
the national media at last summers Democratic convention, and became a regular
guest on the networks Sunday talk shows.My friends, Americans are not looking
for a rock star to be president, they want a serious man of substance, Davis
told convention delegates, in a remark aimed at Al Gore but might just as 
easily
have been said about himself.In the fall, things were falling into place for 
the
politically disciplined, Vietnam veteran. Gores defeat meant the party would 
be
looking for a new star. As the incoming chair of the Democratic Governors 
Association, Davis had a high profile. The Democratic Leadership Counsel the
same centrist organization that launched the careers of Bill Clinton, Al Gore
and Joe Lieberman regarded him as their top office holder.After raising a
political war chest of $25 million and maneuvering himself to become the
education governor, Business Week was one of many publications to declare him
among the most prominent of the Democratic heavyweights.And then the lights 
went
out.Davis always maintained he was focused on Sacramento, not Washington. But 
no
one believed him.The presidential bug is something that seems to infect all
California governors, from Pete Wilson and Jerry Brown to Ronald Reagan. If 
one
includes the vice presidential flirtations of George Deukmejian and Pat Brown,
one has to go back to Republican Goodwin Knight in the 1950s to find a
California governor who has not talked about as part of a national
ticket.Whether Davis less than flamboyant campaign skills would have moved
voters in New Hampshire or Iowa may never be known. He once joked that he gave
Al Gore charisma lessons. Now he jokes how surprised he is to hear the words
Gray Davis and electricity uttered in the same sentence.Too bad.Many 
Easterners
still think of Jerry Brown, Governor Moonbeam, as the quintessential 
California
pol. Davis may never have a chance to dispel the stereotype.The powers down, 
but
Im still toast, the gray-robed Gridiron members sang at their annual
dinner.Seems like only last night, my star was rising. Now Im just another nut
from the coast.

HEADLINE: Utility's bankruptcy filing adds to California's confusion

BYLINE: Martin Kasindorf

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- California's largest utility threw more heat than light on the
state's energy muddle by filing for bankruptcy, power players in the deepening
9-month drama say.

???With electric bills climbing and Californians bracing for blackouts this
summer, stakeholders in the deregulation crisis are wondering what Pacific 
Gas &
Electric's surprise action Friday will bring next.

???An optimistic view: A solution to the crisis will be sped along by moving
the issue of paying off the utility's $ 9 billion debt to the neutral forum 
of a
court. "This is better than what we had before, we think," says Gary Ackerman,
executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, a trade group for
electricity suppliers.

???A pessimistic view: More shortages are coming, and retail rates may become
mired in squabbling between U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali and Gov. Gray
Davis' Public Utilities Commission.

???Meanwhile, the lights are still on for PG&E's 9 million northern and 
central
California customers.

???Here are scenarios envisioned for key forces in the scrimmage:

???* The other utilities. Southern California Edison, which owes $ 5.5 billion
to wholesalers, says it won't follow PG&E into voluntary bankruptcy to get a
breather from creditors. But unpaid suppliers of energy from solar arrays,
windmills and other "alternative" sources may force Edison into bankruptcy.

???To forestall this outcome and back up his gibe that PG&E "dishonored 
itself"
in abandoning negotiations with state officials, Davis is working feverishly 
for
a quick deal this week to buy Edison's transmission lines for the state for $
2.7 billion.

???But buying and running the power grid can't be done piecemeal. To complete
the package, PG&E's lines are needed. The judge may forbid their sale or 
auction
them to private bidders. Davis' plans are "mortally wounded," says University 
of
California at Irvine economist Peter Navarro.

???* The state government. Sacramento officials, who have spent $ 4 billion
buying power for cash-strapped utilities, want to float a $ 10 billion bond
issue to make more buys. State Treasurer Phil Angelides says any delays in
issuing the bonds, as the bond market weighs the effect of the PG&E 
bankruptcy,
won't be serious enough to hurt the state budget.

???"We may have had one or two new hurdles put in front of us, but we're
confident we can get to the finish line," he says.

???* Consumers. Activist groups say Davis shouldn't bail out utilities by
endorsing rate increases. Some activists view bankruptcy court as a shelter 
from
higher bills. Douglas Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer & Consumer Rights
says federal law doesn't allow Judge Montali to unilaterally raise rates.

???"Bankruptcy court might be the only venue in which we can be somewhat
protected," Heller says. "Gov. Davis has been in full appeasement mode with 
the
blackmail artists from Texas and the utilities. How can we do any worse than
that?"

HEADLINE: SURGE IS SEEN IN GAS-FIRED POWER PLANTS

BYLINE: By Jeff Long and Melita Marie Garza, Tribune staff reporters.

BODY:

??Plans are on the drawing board for dozens of new gas-fired power plants in
Illinois, reflecting a national trend that will put even more demand on a 
supply
that this year, at least, was so low that prices soared.

??No one expects the natural gas supply to remain that low for long--hundreds
of new wells are being drilled because of higher prices--but the boom in the
gas-fired generation of electricity raises questions about whether high demand
from those plants will prevent prices from sliding back to what they were a 
few
years ago.

??And as electricity becomes increasingly tied to natural gas, observers say
the demands on one are more likely to change the price of the other.

??"We should be concerned about it," said William Abolt, Chicago's environment
commissioner. "You're getting one energy market where the decisions that are
made about natural gas affect the price of electricity."

??Although Abolt advocates using natural gas instead of coal to generate
electricity--"It means cleaner air," he said--he wonders if the gas industry 
is
prepared for growing demand on its supplies.

??Generating electricity takes a lot of gas. Midwest Generation's gas-fired
power plant in Morris last year burned enough to keep about 192,000 homes
supplied with natural gas for a year: 24 billion cubic feet. That plant
generated only about 7 percent of all the electricity that Midwest produced,
mostly by burning coal.

??Despite the spike in gas prices during the winter, some companies planning 
to
build gas-fired power plants said they have not changed their minds. Even if 
gas
prices never drop to what they were a year ago, they said the new plants will
still be cleaner than coal, and efficient, flexible, and profitable.

??Skip Horvath, president of the Natural Gas Supply Association, said his
industry is planning for the coming demand--on paper, anyway.

??"We are working flat-out to meet that demand," he said, "but we are running
into constraints that are slowing us down." Among those constraints: finding
workers to operate drilling rigs, finding engineers to design them and locate
the supplies, getting access to land where the supplies exist.

??Since 1998, 33 companies have proposed projects in Illinois that would total
about 25,000 megawatts of gas-fired power. Some of those projects, accounting
for about a third of the power, are being built or already operating; others 
are
still in some stage of the permitting process.

??No one expects all 25,000 megawatts to come on line. The state's total
generation capacity now, by comparison, is just under 34,000 megawatts,
including the gas-fired plants that recently have begun generating.

??In Illinois, natural gas makes up about 20 percent of the electricity
generating capacity--some of which comes from plants that can burn either gas 
or
oil. The rest of the state's capacity comes from coal (50 percent) and nuclear
reactors (30 percent).

??If not all of the new generating capacity of the proposed gas-fired plants 
is
needed in Illinois, some of it may be destined for consumers elsewhere in the
Midwest. It wouldn't likely go as far as energy-starved California; industry
officials say that the farther you send electricity, the less profitable it
becomes.

??"Some will sell in Illinois," predicted Howard Learner, executive director 
of
the Environmental Law and Policy Center. "Some will sell out of state. Whether
they sell in state or out of state will not be based on philanthropy, but on
where they can get the best price."

??Gas-fired electricity generation has skyrocketed nationwide. According to
Horvath, 7,300 megawatts went on line in 1999. In 2000, 22,400 megawatts went 
on
line. Another 53,300 megawatts of gas-fired generation is projected this year.

??Horvath's industry has been pushing gas-fired electricity for years. But 
it's
only been in the past few that it really has begun to take off. Horvath stops
short of saying the industry was caught off guard. He points to other demands 
as
contributing to high gas prices during the winter, such as a very cold 
November
and December and a good economy that increased the amount of gas used by
industrial and commercial customers.

??"We were surprised by the magnitude of the turn toward natural-gas electric
generation," Horvath said.

??That turn holds true for Illinois. Just two small coal-fired projects are on
the state's list of pending permits.

??A 1999 study by the U.S. Department of Energy's National Petroleum Council
predicts that electricity generation nationwide will go from using 3.3 
trillion
cubic feet of natural gas in 1998 to 7.8 trillion cubic feet in 2015. Total 
gas
consumption was 22 trillion cubic feet in 1998. The council predicts that will
rise to 31.3 trillion cubic feet in 2015.

??Gas-fired power generation is especially attractive in Illinois for a couple
of reasons:

??First, electricity deregulation means companies other than electric 
utilities
can build plants and sell power.

??Second, there's easy access to many interstate gas pipelines.

??The extent to which all of the new plants will affect gas supply remains to
be seen. Some of the plants won't ever get built, and natural gas production 
has
already increased dramatically.

??"I really don't think we will see a tremendous supply problem," said Jim
Monk, president of the Illinois Energy Association, a trade group for electric
utilities.

??"The question it comes down to is what price people would have to charge for
electricity because of the gas prices," said John Long, a vice president at
Midwest Generation.

??For now, deregulation has frozen electricity rates in Illinois until 2004.
Commonwealth Edison has made long-term contracts with its electricity 
suppliers
so that electric rates don't reflect the higher price of gas. That means
companies such as Midwest Generation had to absorb the higher cost of 
generating
electricity with gas. Midwest switched to burning oil at its Morris plant in
February because of the high cost.

??What will happen after 2004 isn't clear. Arlene Juracek, ComEd's vice
president of regulatory and strategic services, said diversifying the way
electricity is generated is a good thing. That way, price hikes in one sector
can be compensated for by the others.

??Long and others in the industry are still optimistic about the future of
gas-fired electricity. They see the winter's high prices as an unusual blip.

??"In our opinion, gas prices will come down," said Greg Wassilkowsky, manager
of business development at Indeck Energy Services Inc. in Buffalo Grove.

??Competition from more efficient new plants likely will cause older gas-fired
plants to shut down or cut back, Wassilkowsky said, offsetting some of the
increased demand on the natural gas supply.

??In any case, look for the gas-fired plants to thrive.

??"The gas turbines are the technique to use," Wassilkowsky said.

HEADLINE: California's biggest utility files for bankruptcy

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LIEDTKE, AP Business Writer

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

BODY:

??California's biggest utility filed for bankruptcy protection Friday, seeking
relief from the state's energy deregulation debacle. The surprise move will 
not
turn out the lights but could mean political and financial turmoil for years 
to
come.

??In filing for Chapter 11 protection from its creditors, Pacific Gas &
Electric said efforts by Gov. Gray Davis and other state officials to ease the
crisis had gone nowhere.

??"The regulatory and political processes have failed us, and now we are
turning to the court," said Robert D. Glynn Jr., chairman of corporate parent
PG&E Corp. "We expect the court will provide the venue needed to reach a
solution."

??The 13 million people served by the utility probably will be among the least
affected, since bankruptcy proceedings allow companies to continue operating
while they try to solve their financial problems under the supervision of a
federal judge.

??But lenders, bondholders and wholesale power suppliers may have to write off
billions of dollars in losses, and the move could affect more than 20,000
utility employees across Central and Northern California.

??US Bank of St. Paul is among a long list of creditors. The utility owes the
bank $310 million for pollution control bonds, according to the bankruptcy
filing.

??The company's financial reputation also could be damaged for years, making 
it
more difficult to buy power and raise money to upgrade transmission lines and
plants.

??Davis, who has been accused by fellow Democrats as well as Republicans of 
not
moving decisively to solve California's power crisis, did not immediately
comment on the bankruptcy filing. A spokesman said it was a surprise.

??Just a day earlier, Davis delivered his first statewide address on the
crisis, and dropped his opposition to higher electricity rates.

??After listening to Davis' speech, however, PG&E executives said they
concluded there was little hope of getting relief from the state. PG&E cited
"unreimbursed energy costs, which are now increasing by more than $300 million
per month," bad state regulatory decisions and the "unmistakable fact that
negotiations with Gov. Gray Davis and his representatives are going nowhere."

??Southern California Edison, the state's second-largest utility, said it has
no immediate plans to seek bankruptcy protection.

??The two utilities have been pinched for months by skyrocketing wholesale
power prices and the state's 1996 deregulation law, which bars them from 
passing
those costs on to customers. The two utilities say they have lost more than 
$13
billion since June and are having trouble buying power and natural gas because
of their credit is so poor.

??The two utilities had warned for months that they were sliding toward
bankruptcy. And the crisis led to rolling blackouts over four days in January
and March as electricity supplies dwindled to nearly nothing.

??The state has stepped in and spent $4.7 billion since January to buy power
for the utilities.

??Those efforts could not stave off the biggest rate increase in California 
history: The state Public Utilities Commission last week approved rate hikes 
of
up to 46 percent for customers of SoCal Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric. 

??Consumer activists criticized the bankruptcy filing, complaining that the
utility's parent company has been making huge profits during the crisis 
through
other subsidiaries.

??"The parent company has $30 billion, much of which it has siphoned out of 
the
utility coffers. It would have bailed the utility out," said Harvey Rosenfield
of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights.

??State Sen. Debra Bowen, chairwoman of the Senate Energy Committee, said
consumers should see no change in the short run in prices and service.

??The crisis is blamed on a number of factors, including the high wholesale
prices, a tight supply worsened by scarce hydroelectric power in the Northwest
and maintenance of aging California power plants.

??Earlier this week, state power grid managers warned that California will see
more than a month of rolling blackouts for as many as 5 million people at a 
time
if residents use as much power this summer as last.

??Pacific Gas & Electric's preliminary bankruptcy filing lists its top 
creditor
as Bank of New York, which was owed $2.2 billion as of September.

??The utility had run up an $8.9 billion deficit buying electricity as of Feb.
28. A month later, it had $2.6 billion in cash and outstanding bills of $4.4
billion.

??PG&E Corp. stock fell more than 37 percent when trading resumed after being
halted for more than two hours. The stock closed at $7.20, down $4.18, on the
New York Stock Exchange. The 52-week high was $32.50. The stock of SoCal 
Edison
parent Edison International was down $4.39, or 35 percent, to $8.25.

DEMOCRATS SLAM BUSH 'INACTION' IN ENERGY CRISIS;

ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS DISPUTE THE CHARGE AND ACCUSE CONGRESSMEN OF
EXPLOITING THE SITUATION FOR PARTISAN GAIN.

BYLINE: ALISSA J. RUBIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER



DATELINE: WASHINGTON

BODY:


??Congressional Democrats sharpened their criticism of President Bush's
handling of the Western energy crisis Saturday, using their national radio
address to accuse him of failing to move aggressively to protect consumers 
from
rising electricity prices and power supply shortages.

??"We know that in a crisis, inaction is not an option," said Rep. Jay Inslee
(D-Wash.). "But to date, unfortunately, that is all America has received from
the Bush administration--inaction and excuses."

??The Democratic comments came as Congress is facing pressure to respond to 
the
energy crisis--lawmakers from the West, in particular, are hearing from
consumers concerned about sharply higher prices and potential blackouts during
the summer.

??A power crisis through the summer would almost certainly become a political
rallying point for politicians on Capitol Hill eager to push new energy
policies.

??Bush administration officials strongly disputed the Democratic charge that
they were ignoring the power crisis and asserted they have taken every step
possible except price controls on electricity suppliers.

??"It is unfortunate that some Democrats are trying to exploit this crisis for
partisan gain, distorting the record," Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham said 
in
a statement. "We oppose price controls . . . ?but the Bush administration will
continue to look for constructive ways to remove obstacles to new electricity 
supply in California and the West."

??Bush has called for aggressive new oil exploration while making clear he 
will
not support any form of price controls on power suppliers.

??Democrats have touted approaches that combine much more limited exploration.
And some, such as Inslee, want to see the government intervene when prices
skyrocket.

??Inslee, in his remarks Saturday, singled out for criticism the Federal 
Energy
Regulatory Commission, which regulates interstate electricity markets. He
charged that the agency had failed to ensure that consumers would not be 
gouged.

??The commission "has the responsibility to assure that only reasonable energy
prices are charged," Inslee said. He charged that the Bush administration was
refusing to enforce fair pricing laws.

??Sen. Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico, who joined Inslee in delivering the
Democratic radio message, called on Bush to work on a bipartisan basis with
Congress to draft an energy plan that balances new exploration and the
development of clean fuel supplies with energy conservation measures. He also
urged Bush to make good on campaign promises to expand emergency assistance to
low-income families feeling the pinch.

??"I hope the Bush administration recognizes the need to step up and to work 
on
a bipartisan basis to meet these challenges head-on," Bingaman said.

??"We can encourage natural gas development and oil drilling in regions where
it's been done in an environmentally sound way for decades," he added. "We can
provide incentives that help families conserve energy, thereby cutting their
utility bills."

??Bingaman and 14 other senators, including Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle
(D-S.D.), introduced two pieces of energy legislation last month. One would
create tax incentives to encourage businesses to expand natural gas production
in selected areas of the country. It also would encourage the development of
"clean" coal production and of renewable energy sources, such as wind and 
solar
power.

??The second measure would encourage energy conservation and launch an 
in-depth
study of the problems plaguing the nation's wholesale electricity market.

?POWER CRISIS: BEFORE ITS FILING, THE UTILITY ALSO HAD $2.5 BILLION ON HAND 
AND
HAD RESTARTED SERVICES SUSPENDED EARLIER BECAUSE OF SHAKY FINANCES.

BYLINE: TIM REITERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER



DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

BODY:


??In the days approaching Pacific Gas & Electric Co.'s bankruptcy filing, the
debt-ridden utility had more than $ 2.5 billion in cash on hand and was
restarting services suspended earlier this year because of its shaky finances.

??Then, the day before the filing, the utility awarded 6,000 managers and 
other
employees more than $ 50 million in annual bonuses and announced that
long-delayed merit increases had kicked in for the same workers.

??The timing of the bonus payments in particular raised an outcry from 
consumer
groups and state officials.

??"Management is suffering from two afflictions: Denial and greed," Gov. Gray
Davis said in a statement.

??"It does not look good," said state Senate President Pro Tem John Burton.
"They already have a business and a P.R. problem."

??The bonuses and raises were announced in an e-mail sent Thursday by Chief
Executive Robert Glynn to employees. The payments cover about a third of the
company's 19,000 workers, ranging from nonunion clerical staff to all but the
very top management.

??On Friday, hours after PG&E had filed for reorganization of its debts under
Chapter 11 bankruptcy laws, a San Francisco judge approved the company's 
overall
employee compensation plan. But PG&E officials said the ruling did not
specifically cover the bonuses or merit raises.

??Harvey Rosenfield, president of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer
Rights, said the bonuses should not be allowed.

??"Talk about manipulating the corporate finances to benefit management prior
to bankruptcy," he said. "It is the kind of arrogant mismanagement that is
responsible for the ruin of this company."

??Richard Levin, a Los Angeles bankruptcy attorney, said such payments to
employees are not unusual, especially after the filing of bankruptcy.

??"A company trying to reorganize has to take pretty strong action to keep
employees," he said. "If they did not do it, who is going to keep the
electricity flowing?"

??PG&E, the state's largest utility, declared in its filing for bankruptcy
protection that it is more than $ 9 billion in debt--several times more than
cash on hand--and was getting nowhere in negotiations with the governor for
state purchase of its power lines and other assets. The filing, which 
includes a
list of creditors, allows the company to continue to operate while it
reorganizes its financial affairs. A judge, working under federal bankruptcy
law, will determine who will be paid and in what order. The first hearing is
scheduled for Monday.

??Company officials defended the payments, which were reported in Saturday's
San Francisco Chronicle, and fired back at Davis. "Instead of focusing all his
attention on solving the state's yearlong and ever-worsening energy crisis, 
the
governor has launched a campaign-style attack on our company," PG&E said in a
statement Saturday.

??The payments, officials said, are awarded each year to employees who meet 
the
company's performance goals and objectives. "They are smaller this year 
because
of the larger financial crisis the company is going through but, it is safe to
say, more deserved this year than in years past because of the challenges 
facing
our employees this year," said PG&E spokesman John Nelson.

??The payments came after the company began reversing some of the cost-cutting
measures imposed early this year after its finances worsened, PG&E officials
said.

??PUC Orders End to Some Cutbacks

??Among other things, PG&E had suspended projects involving the underground
placement of power lines, prompting cities and residents to protest to state
regulators. The company also eliminated about 325 jobs earlier this year and 
was
planning layoffs of almost 700 more. But the California Public Utilities
Commission last month blocked the layoffs and ordered the company to rescind 
any
cutbacks affecting service.

??Company officials said that, thanks in part to a tax refund of $ 1.1 
billion,
the company now has about $ 2.5 billion to $ 2.8 billion on hand.

??"We are now in a position to start relaxing some of those cash-conservation
measures," Nelson said Saturday. "About a week ago we started doing
undergrounding again and performing new installations of electrical service" 
in
business parks and elsewhere.

??"This compensation package was one of those measures reinstated," he said.

??Officials said the payments exempted the company's 25 officers, as well as
about 12,000 union workers who received raises in January.

??They said the total of the bonuses, estimated roughly at more than $ 50
million, is substantially lower than the $ 83 million in payments suspended in
January when the utility announced cost-cutting measures.

??That $ 83 million included bonuses for employee performance and a bonus 
based
on the company's success.

??"As we close the books for 2000, we have determined that we are unable to
make that portion of the incentive payment due to the negative financial 
impact
of the ongoing California energy crisis," CEO Glynn said in his e-mail.

??He said the incentive bonuses were awarded along with merit increases
averaging 3% for all employees, effective April 1. Bonuses commonly are about
four weeks of salary, officials said, but can vary according to performance 
and
other factors.

??Mike Florio, senior attorney at the Utility Reform Network, said, "That is
going to be a little hard for the public to swallow. . . . I feel better that
the 25 top executives are not included. Those are the people that have run 
this
company into the ground."

??On Saturday, Davis administration negotiators redoubled efforts to keep the
same fate from befalling Southern California Edison.

??Davis hopes for a state takeover of the massive system of electricity 
transmission lines owned by PG&E, Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric. 
However,
the bankruptcy complicates that effort, which already has proved to be 
daunting.
A federal bankruptcy judge will have to approve any deal that involves PG&E.

??Edison executives and Davis' aides met in San Francisco in an effort to
strike a deal by which the state would purchase Edison's share of the
transmission system for $ 2.76 billion. The company would use the money to
restructure its debt.

??Edison has agreed in principle to sell the state its transmission system.
However, the company is seeking relief from some PUC regulations that could
later undermine aspects of the deal and could jeopardize the company's future
financial stability.

??On Saturday, Burton reiterated his call for the governor to "commandeer" two
or three power plants owned by out-of-state producers. "These people have us 
by
the throat and are making more money than God," he told a news conference 
here.
"You have to fight back."

??Steve Maviglio, the governor's press secretary, said Davis has not ruled out
such a seizure.

STATE LOOKS TO PUBLIC POWER AS SOLUTION TO ENERGY CRISIS

BYLINE: JAMES FLANIGAN



BODY:


??California, which led the nation into electric power deregulation, is about
to give it another model to contemplate: public power.

??The bankruptcy filing Friday of PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric Co. only
underlines the role that a new state power authority is slated to play as an
electricity supplier of last resort.

??The authority, which is being set up through legislation, would finance 
power
plants, even build them if necessary. It probably would own and expand the
transmission lines that carry power throughout the state.

??Energy experts such as S. David Freeman, general manager of the Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power, say a California power authority is the only 
way
to get plants built and paid for. State Treasurer Philip Angelides has been
preparing since January to set one up. And Mayor Richard Riordan of Los 
Angeles
says that "a state authority is the only way to get siting for power plants 
and
get things moving."

??The Pacific Gas & Electric bankruptcy filing will delay some plans, such as
the state's proposed purchase of the utility's transmission lines. But
ultimately, state ownership will be necessary because no private party seems
able or willing to invest $ 1 billion or so to upgrade the lines to meet
California's needs.

??In the long term, public power would ensure that California has a surplus of
electricity instead of the shortages it has today. But that security is 
expected
to come at a price, as the costs of power may be higher than many other states
will be paying.

??Electricity deregulation nationwide may yet fulfill its promise of lower
rates and better service. Time will tell. But California's flawed 
deregulation 
plan has failed, and now state funds and public agencies are picking up the
pieces.

??The state's costs will be high. Angelides plans to sell $ 17 billion in
revenue bonds to finance purchases of electricity and transmission lines. But
Thursday night, after Gov. Gray Davis' speech on energy, state officials gave 
a
briefing to financial analysts in which state debt numbers totaling $ 20 
billion
were discussed, as well as revenue bonds for utility debts of $ 8 billion.

??California electricity users would pay such debts over 15 years, reports
Gerald Keenan, a utility strategist for the accounting firm
PricewaterhouseCoopers who participated in Thursday's briefing.

??The prospect is that electricity delivery in California a few years from now
will not be in the hands of the three investor-owned utilities but will be 
owned
by municipal and regional agencies.

??Yet the real story, amid today's chaos and uncertainty, is that California 
residents and even the investor-owned utilities themselves welcome the shift
from private to public ownership.

??Political support has been growing. Last summer, when electric bills first
rose in San Diego, residents called for the city to take over Sempra Energy's
San Diego Gas & Electric subsidiary. Similar groups in San Francisco were
calling for city-owned power long before supplier Pacific Gas & Electric filed
for bankruptcy.

??The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power is the model other cities are
looking to.

??The nation's largest municipally owned utility at $ 2.7 billion in annual
revenue, the DWP has been hailed for having abundant power supplies at low
prices all through the state's energy crisis. It has those supplies because 
the
DWP, like all municipal utilities, was exempt from deregulation. 

??"Public power is taking a giant leap, and private power meanwhile has fallen
on its face," says DWP chief Freeman, veteran of public power agencies for 
more
than 30 years.

??Freeman, who favored deregulation when he came to Los Angeles in 1997, now
says it has wrecked a good system.

??"Since the days of Thomas Edison, private utilities were responsible for
keeping the lights on," he says. "The deal was you got a local monopoly. For
that you earned a rate of return on your assets and paid a secure dividend and
widows owned your stock."

??But deregulation, which sought to spur competition among generators of
electric power, changed all that.

??In California, Pacific Gas & Electric, Edison International's Southern
California Edison and SDG&E were forced to sell their power plants to other
companies. Subsequently they got caught up in the ruinous spiral of paying 
high
prices for wholesale power but having to sell it at low, fixed prices to 
retail
customers.

??Now the role of investor-owned electric utilities in the state may be at an
end. And the irony, sources say, is that their parent companies are quietly
happy to relinquish the business.

??All have developed profitable, unregulated subsidiaries and non-utility
divisions.

??PG&E Corp., for example, gets more than 50% of its $ 24 billion in annual
revenue from unregulated power-generating facilities in other states and from
energy trading. Without its utility, PG&E sees itself as a growing company
participating in the transformation of electricity markets nationwide and
worldwide.

??Elsewhere, after all, utility companies such as North Carolina's Duke 
Energy,
Kansas' Utilicorp United and Georgia's Mirant Corp. (formerly Southern Co.) 
are
hailed as attractive growth companies by investment analysts.

??Similarly, Edison International earns almost $ 400 million a year in profit
from its Edison Mission Energy and Edison Capital subsidiaries. A company
headquartered in a state short of power plants, Mission Energy is the
second-largest owner of power plants in the United States, with facilities in
Pennsylvania, Illinois and the Midwest as well as plants in Europe and Asia.

??Edison and PG&E have taken pains to segregate those moneymaking subsidiaries
from their regulated businesses, although lawyers for creditors in the PG&E
bankruptcy proceeding will surely try to attach such profitable assets.

??A comparable pattern of regulated and unregulated divisions holds for 
Sempra,
which is not threatened by the massive debts overhanging PG&E and Edison.

??So what's the real outlook for the state's utility companies--and for the
state's electricity supply?

??The DWP's Freeman sees the companies spinning off their utility subsidiaries
to shareholders or selling them to municipalities. He notes: "Their boards of
directors are saying, 'Why do we need this heartache?' "

??Fine, but will a change in utility ownership help solve California's energy
crisis?

??Not really, says Lawrence Makovich, senior electricity analyst at Cambridge
Energy Research Associates.

??"California is pursuing distractions, arguing about transmission lines and
utility finances," he says. "It needs to build power plants."

??But Freeman counters that state authority and public ownership are just what
will ensure that plants are built.

??"We'll see to it that enough plants are built and old plants re-powered to
give the state a 15% reserve of power," says Freeman, who has headed the
Tennessee Valley Authority, the New York State Power Authority and the
Sacramento Municipal Utility District in a long career. Attaining a 15% 
reserve
would mean adding at least 5,000 megawatts of power--enough to serve about 
3.75
million typical homes.

??The price of power, he reckons, will be $ 60 to $ 70 a megawatt-hour. That's
about double the cost before the energy crisis--but a bargain compared with
current rates in California's dysfunctional spot market. Many electric bills 
are
sure to rise 30% to 40%.

??But we'll have our power, and that rate may be reasonable compared with 
those
of other states a few years from now, Freeman says. "By 2003 we'll be out of 
the
woods, and by 2004 California will be a model to the rest of the country."

??Will the California model of state power work better than its deregulation 
did? We'd better hope so.

DAVIS HAS STATE HEADED FOR POWER WIPEOUT;
?THE GOVERNOR DUCKED HIS RESPONSIBILITY TO STEER CALIFORNIA AWAY FROM THE
ELECTRICITY CRISIS, AN EX-SURFING CHAMP SAYS.

BYLINE: JOYCE HOFFMAN, Joyce Hoffman, a former women's world surfing champion,
lives in, Laguna Beach



BODY:


??Back in the 1960s, my needs for energy were basic. I drove up and down the
coast of California competing and looking for the best waves in a 1960 VW bus
that seemed to go from San Diego to Santa Cruz on not much more than a tank of
gas.

??Good old Mother Nature provided the energy that produced the waves I rode,
and while "she" could sometimes be a little stingy, on the whole, there were
more than enough waves for the number of people brave enough or crazy enough 
to
be surfers in those days.

??It was more difficult to be a surfer in the 1960s. The wetsuits were
extremely primitive and not particularly effective. The typical surfboard
weighed at least 40 pounds.

??Well, that was 40 years ago and a lot has changed. With the advent of the
modern wetsuit and leashes and surfboards so light and maneuverable that 
anyone
from 2 to 90 can handle them, we have an energy crisis in the water. There is
too much demand for the supply. We have too many surfers chasing too few 
waves.

??My life is very different today. I am no longer a professional athlete
constantly chasing the next wave and the next title. I manage a portfolio
consisting of real estate in Orange County and the Inland Empire. All the
qualities of discipline and focus and vision that enabled me to reach the
pinnacle of a sport have ensured my success in the "real world" of business.

??Energy still plays a large role in my life, but it is a much more complex
issue than it once was. While I realize that the blame for our current crisis
can be spread far and wide, I believe that the highest-elected official in
California has ducked his responsibility.

??It is obvious that Gov. Davis made a political decision against rate
increases last year when problems with the supply and demand of energy first
surfaced. Our governor has shown himself to be more concerned with his own
political ambitions than the long-term health of California.

??The problem was allowed to go unchecked, and the ramifications of this
inaction will haunt Californians for decades. Most of the properties I manage
have no mechanism to pass these increases through to the users. The majority 
of
the tenants have long-term leases wherein their monthly rent obligation 
includes
their utility usage, and most of these leases include yearly increases of 3% 
to
4% in order to compensate for a modest degree of inflation. I do not know how 
I
or other small-business owners can absorb increases of this size.

??It is times like these that I feel a great deal of nostalgia for the brutal
honesty and simplicity of sports. The governor and his administration have 
shown
themselves unable or unwilling to even compete at the most basic level. Isn't 
it
a shame that the qualities of discipline, focus and vision are in such short
supply in our leaders?

HEADLINE: Ratepayers lose clout PG&E filing cuts consumers' ability to exert
pressure on a rescue plan.

BYLINE: Carrie Peyton and Stuart Leavenworth Bee Staff Writers

BODY:

??Short of electricity and even shorter of patience, consumers suddenly have
lost some influence in California's energy crisis: their ability to exert
political pressure over a rescue plan for the state's biggest utility.

??Friday's decision by the Pacific Gas and Electric Co. to file for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection effectively shifts responsibility for the utility's 
future
from state leaders to a federal judge, one who doesn't necessarily need to 
look
out for consumer interests.

??With near-monarchical powers, Judge Dennis Montali temporarily could double
electricity bills. He could sell off PG&E's vast land holdings. He could 
unravel
Gov. Gray Davis' hopes of buying the state's electric grid.

??Legally, the biggest creditors have the loudest voices in a bankruptcy.
Customers generally have none.

??Consumer groups say they are worried about the unchartered territory into
which PG&E has plunged the state, but power generators say they are pleased 
that
creditors can make their case in a less-politicized forum.

??"We've filtered out the politics, we've filtered out the consumer rage," 
said
Gary Ackerman, head of the Western Power Trading Forum, a coalition of
electricity marketers. "Now we're down to creditors and debtors."

??As the historic bankruptcy case unfolds in San Francisco, the fate of
consumers will be just one of a multitude of unknowns in the state's power
future and its repercussions for California's economy.

??The questions could touch everyone from environmental groups worried about
PG&E lands to Sacramento Municipal Utility District customers who might face
more rate hikes if changes are made to complex power contracts that involve
PG&E, SMUD and a key SMUD supplier.

??Amid intense focus on the bankruptcy's implications, PG&E was upbraided
Saturday by Davis and consumer groups for paying incentive bonuses to about
6,000 executives and workers Thursday, one day before it declared bankruptcy.

??"PG&E's management is suffering from two afflictions: denial and greed,"
Davis said.

??The bonuses, normally given out annually, were withheld in January as part 
of
PG&E's cash conservation efforts. They were resumed along with power line
upgrades and other programs when the utility concluded it had enough cash, 
said
PG&E spokesman John Nelson.

??They would have totaled $80 million in a good year and were less this year,
he said, unable to supply a figure. The money went to everyone from file 
clerks
to company directors, but excluded company officers, Nelson said.

??While PG&E was defending its actions, Judge Montali was apparently at work
Saturday, as updates on next week's hearing schedule appeared on the Web page 
of
the federal Bankruptcy Court's Northern District.

??Before his appointment eight years ago, Montali was a prominent San 
Francisco
bankruptcy lawyer who tackled major cases.

??"He's a workaholic. He'll work as many hours as it takes," said San 
Francisco
bankruptcy lawyer John Hansen, who has known Montali for more than 25 years.

??He described the judge as likely to look for creative solutions, and 
probably
willing to establish new law if he concludes there's a basis for quickly 
raising
electric rates.

??Montali, a 61-year-old judge with long experience handling bankruptcy cases,
will face some daunting rulings as he presides over the largest utility
bankruptcy filing in the country's history.

??Should he force PG&E's parent company to pay off some debts of its
subsidiary? Should he force the utility to give up its transmission lines or 
its
hydroelectric plants to the state? Should he call for PG&E customers to pay
higher rates as part of the reorganization plan, and if so, how much?

??"He is certainly going to get his 15 minutes of fame," said Lynn LoPucki, a
law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. "How would you 
like
to be the guy who triples the utility rates of the state where he sits?"

??As LoPucki notes, under federal law, a bankruptcy judge cannot permanently
raise rates in California without approval of the state's Public Utilities
Commission.

??But while a utility's reorganization is being shaped by the court, he said, 
a
judge appears to have wide latitude to unilaterally raise rates until he
approves a final plan.

??The point has not been litigated in previous utility bankruptcy filings, but
one section of the federal bankruptcy code says a judge may "issue any order,
process or judgment that is necessary or appropriate to carry out the 
provision
of this title."

??"A lot of us have assumed the bankruptcy judge has no authority to raise
rates while the case has gone on," said LoPucki. "But that has been called 
into
question by various lawyers, and it is far from settled."

??Hansen said it would not be "beyond the pale" for a bankruptcy judge to
conclude that PG&E can't reasonably put together a reorganization plan until 
it
can charge enough to cover its wholesale costs. Over the last year, average
wholesale electricity prices have increased more than 800 percent, while 
retail
rates have gone up just under 50 percent.

??"The judge would be making new law," he said, and from what he knows of
Montali, "I don't think he'd be hesitant to do it."

??If he chooses, Montali could hand down those decisions with no input from 
the
5.5 million households and businesses that write checks to PG&E every month.

??Consumer groups are not powerless. They could sue to force PG&E's parent
company to pay some of the utility's debts, assuming the PUC fails in its own
attempt to require PG&E Corp. to kick in some money. And LoPucki said he
wouldn't be surprised if Judge Montali gave consumer groups some kind of voice
in the proceedings.

??But there is no requirement for a bankruptcy judge to listen to consumers,
acknowledged Harvey Rosenfield of the Foundation for Taxpayers and Consumer
Rights. Still, his group will try to be heard.

??"Any legitimate process has to include the ratepayers," he said, and courts
have allowed it before.

??The case, to continue Monday with hearings into numerous issues on how PG&E
handles its cash, potentially could affect every element of the state's
electricity morass.

??Montali could determine whether a 29 percent average rate hike approved by
regulators last month is divvied up as the PUC specified. If the judge 
approves
some other formula, that could call into question how the state is repaid for
PG&E's share of the $3 billion-plus California has spent buying power since
January. PG&E has complained that the state formula is unfair, but utility
spokesman Nelson said Saturday that PG&E believes payments to California will 
be
made in full because they are protected under state law.

??The judge has another route to raise rates, if he chooses: He could decide 
to
pull PG&E's existing federal lawsuit against the PUC into the bankruptcy
proceeding, and rule himself on whether federal law forces state regulators to
let PG&E raise rates.

??Montali also will review PG&E's dealings with alternative power plants,
called qualifying facilities, and if PG&E asks to sever those contracts, he
could cut them free, which would force PG&E to buy more of its power on the
pricey wholesale market and increase costs for its customers.

??He could approve the sale of utility property, including up to 140,000 acres
of PG&E forest lands, reservoirs and campgrounds.

??"That could mean that some of its lands are sold to developers, and their
environmental values will be lost," said Steve Evans of the conservation group
Friends of the River.

??Consumer advocate Michael Shames said his biggest fear is not that the judge
would raise rates, but that to restore PG&E to health, its power plants or 
other
assets would be "sold off and put in the hands of the same friendly folks 
who've
been gouging us."

??And for the most part, the consumers who could be touched by almost every
action the judge takes will be watching.

??Haskel Causey, co-owner of a lumber company in West Sacramento, said he
wasn't thrilled about a bankruptcy judge determining the rates paid by 13
million people in PG&E's service territory.

??"It's going to have a tremendous effect on the economy," Causey said
Saturday, of the prospect of higher rates. "People will be more concerned 
about
their energy bills, and they are going to spend less. Then you throw in the
downturn in the stock market, and things are look pretty bleak."

SECTION: MAIN NEWS; Pg. A16; Q&A on PG&E

LENGTH: 800 words

HEADLINE: Chapter 11 filing just the first of many steps

BYLINE: Stuart Leavenworth and Carrie Peyton Bee Staff Writers

BODY:

??When Gov. Gray Davis gave his State of the State speech in January, he
painted a bleak picture of a utility's potential bankruptcy.

??"Bankruptcy would mean that millions of Californians would be subject to
electricity blackouts, public safety would be jeopardized, businesses would
close, jobs would be lost, investment would flee the state, and our economy
would suffer a devastating blow," Davis said on Jan. 8.

??The governor may have engaged in hyperbole, but PG&E's filing for bankruptcy
protection Friday is sure to rock the state in unexpected ways. Here are some
answers to basic questions about the bankruptcy filing:

??Q: What does a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing do?

??A: Chapter 11 temporarily shields PG&E from legal claims of creditors, 
mainly
power generators the utility hasn't paid for electricity. The company's next
step is to come up with a "reorganization plan" to pay its debts, estimated 
at $
9 billion. Such a plan must be approved by creditors and the court.

??Q: Will PG&E customers face higher rates, beyond the 29 percent increase
approved by the Public Utilities Commission?

??A: Not immediately. Judge Dennis Montali first will want to study the PUC's
rate increase. If he finds it isn't adequate to keep PG&E in business, he 
could
order a temporary rate increase to tide the utility over until a 
reorganization
plan is approved, according to some legal experts. Under federal laws, 
however,
the PUC would have to approve any rate increase that is part of the final
reorganization plan.

??Q: Will PG&E employees or management be affected?

??A: Typically, a judge issues orders ensuring that employees' benefits and
salaries remain intact. Current management stays in place.

??Q: Which creditors get paid first?

??A: Under federal law, creditors are paid in the following order:

??* Secured creditors, such as banks that loaned money for power plants.
Revenue bondholders also are secured creditors, but only to the extent of the
collateral they secured.

??* Companies that lend money to keep PG&E running during the bankruptcy
period.

??* Employees, contractors, vendors and others who keep the company running.

??* Unsecured creditors, such as power generators and collection agencies for
those companies, such as the California Independent System Operator.

??* PG&E's parent, PG&E Corp.

??* PG&E shareholders.

??Q: Who will be part of the bankruptcy hearings?

??A: The main parties will be PG&E and a committee, or committees, of secured
and unsecured creditors. Judge Montali probably will allow state 
representatives
to participate.

??Q: How long does a bankruptcy proceeding last?

??A: A typical case lasts about a year, although some have lasted six or more.

??Q: Will California be paid back for the energy it is buying for PG&E?

??A: PG&E says California is a secured creditor and will be paid back. But 
some
generators say they may challenge California's status.

??Q: Could PG&E's parent corporation be forced to pay off some of PG&E's 
debts?

??A: Possibly. A judge ordered a parent of Dow Corning to cover some debts 
when
it sought bankruptcy protection during its litigation over silicon breast
implants.

??Q: Will the filing hurt California's finances?

??A: Unclear. Moody's Investors Services didn't change California's bond 
rating
Friday. But it changed its outlook on general interest bonds from "stable" to
"negative."

??Q: Does the state still plan to take over the transmission grid of PG&E,
Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric?

??A: Gov. Davis says talks are continuing with Edison and SDG&E. But many
analysts and some lawmakers say the state would achieve little by assuming 
only
part of the grid, and the PG&E portion couldn't be transferred to the state
unless a court approved it.

??Q: Will PG&E's filing affect the Sacramento Municipal Utility District?

??A: SMUD could be affected because it is owed about $36 million by the state
Independent System Operator, which in turn is a PG&E creditor. SMUD also is
worried about the filing's impact on an ongoing dispute before federal
regulators that could boost the price of a large wholesale power contract.

??Q: What will happen next?

??A: PG&E has 120 days to file its reorganization plan, spelling out how it
will repay its debts. Often, such plans are worked out with major creditors,
because they have a vote on the outcome.

??Q: Is it certain PG&E will pursue bankruptcy protection?

??A: No. It's possible for a debtor and all its creditors to agree that 
they've
found a way around the bankruptcy, and to come back to the judge together and
say they no longer need to be in Chapter 11 proceeding. But such cases are 
rare.

??Q: Is any group a clear winner in this process?

??A: Yes - lawyers.

HEADLINE: Lessons from history Electricity still needs a public role

BODY:

??"The question is whether the state herself shall develop and distribute ...
at least a large share of this power ... or whether the people shall suffer
private corporations, operating solely for profit ..."

??Bee editorial August 29, 1912

??As California struggles to regain control of its electricity system, it is
easy to lose sight of the big picture and hard to contemplate how history 
could
provide any guidance to something so contemporary, so monstrously complex. Yet
history turns out to be a valuable compass that could help lead us in the 
right
direction.

??This seemingly new fight over generators, grids and prices is actually a 
very
old one. Dormant for decades as the status quo remained unchanged, it has
abruptly reawakened. Today's debate is couched in the language of our time, 
with
all those energy institutions with abbreviations like FERC, ISO, PUC and PX. ?

??Fundamentally, however, the dilemma remains unchanged. Electricity is as
unique a commodity as it is vital. It cannot be stored. It must be generated
precisely when it is needed. This poses an extraordinary challenge for
government to guarantee a reliable, affordable supply. It demands a balancing 
of
the vital roles of the public and private sectors. Given today's crisis --
private utilities wallowing in debt, merchant generators extracting high 
prices,
consumers facing ever-rising rates -- the search for that right balance 
remains
an elusive one.

??This newspaper first engaged the question near its very inception. The West
was young. The rules of the game were largely unwritten. And the public 
interest
was threatened by private greed. Would government or companies dam the rivers
and build the hydroelectric plants? Who would control the grid? And perhaps 
most
important, could citizens revolt against the local, privately held monopoly 
and
turn power into a public enterprise?

??That's what Sacramento did against PG&E in the 1920s. Voters created the
Sacramento Municipal Utility District. They funded hydroelectric projects in 
the
Sierra. And they wrested the local distribution system from a resistant PG&E.

??Other cities such as Lodi, Roseville, Modesto, Los Angeles and Redding
created public power agencies or city power departments with leaders elected 
by
voters, not shareholders. The eventual result in California was a blend of
public and privately held agencies. Public power provided a yardstick by which
to measure the private sector. This system was hardly perfect. But it wasn't
broken.

??Now it is. The fixes must redefine the roles of the public and private
sectors to bring the system back in balance.

??Will government or private companies own the new plants that supply those
precious last megawatts of power at the pricey peak? Who will own or expand 
the
transmission grid to relieve bottlenecks that stifle competition? Will private
utilities be allowed to take their customers for granted, or will citizens 
have
the unfettered right to create a public power agency in their community?

??In our race to deregulate in the 1990s, we forgot how public power has
provided the discipline for the private marketplace that left to itself will
feast on price volatility. The public interest simply cannot be delegated to 
the
private sector. Not then, not now, not ever. This is the lesson of history. As
we go about the fixes, we cannot afford to forget this yet again.

HEADLINE: In wake of PG&E bankruptcy, California governor, state officials
scramble for solution

BYLINE: By Steve Johnson

BODY:

??SAN JOSE, Calif. _ The way they lambasted each other for PG&E's plunge into
bankruptcy Friday, Gov. Gray Davis and the utility's top executives sounded 
like
innocent passengers on the Titanic, seemingly powerless to prevent it from
sinking.

??In reality, the governor and officials at Pacific Gas & Electric Co. _ along
with state regulators _ were supposed to be at the helm. Though PG&E's 
fortunes
are now in the hands of a bankruptcy judge, little has changed for state
authorities. They still bear much of the responsibility for charting
California's course out of its energy crisis.

??But the problems that PG&E ran into _ from a critical shortage of power
plants to an easily manipulated electricity market _ still threaten the state
and won't be quickly solved.

??Eager to avoid another utility bankruptcy, Davis officials met Saturday with
Southern California Edison officials in San Francisco to firm up state plans 
to
buy the transmission lines of Edison and the San Diego utility owned by Sempra
Energy Co. The idea is to give those businesses _ especially financially
strapped Edison _ a much-needed infusion of cash.

??But since the state's hopes to buy PG&E's lines have hit a major snag, some
people worry that the state may wind up owning only half of California's power
grid, which they fear would be of limited value.

??"Does it make any sense to have the transmission lines of Edison and Sempra,
and not PG&E?" asked Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco, on
Saturday. "I don't know the answer to that."

??Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said Saturday that the state is exploring the
possibility of acquiring PG&E's transmission lines through the bankruptcy 
court.
In fact, Maviglio said some lawmakers are mulling the idea of taking over all 
of
PG&E _ an option Davis has not ruled out.

??Even if the state does take over all three companies' lines _ and PG&E's
other operations _ it would still have to deal with the major hazards that
contributed to PG&E's demise. And until some way is found to navigate around
those, many experts believe, California and its consumers will remain in
perilous straits.

??As things stand now, said Stanford Economist Frank Wolak, "we're looking at 
a
disaster in a big way this summer."

??The shortage of power supplies

??In explaining why the utility suddenly filed for bankruptcy _ catching Davis
and other lawmakers by surprise _ Robert Glynn Jr., Pacific Gas and Electric 
Co.
chairman, said negotiations with the governor were "going nowhere."

??Davis fired back that PG&E "has dishonored itself" and "acted in a selfish
manner."

??Yet a more fundamental reason for PG&E's financial collapse is California's 
critical shortage of power plants. And despite PG&E's bankruptcy, that 
situation
hasn't changed.

??Under the 1996 law that deregulated the sale of electricity in California, 
PG&E and other utilities were encouraged to sell their power plants so other
companies could enter the energy producing business, presumably spurring
competition and lowering prices for consumers.

??But while companies did buy many of PG&E's plants, they delayed building new
ones, because of uncertainties about the newly deregulated system. Meanwhile,
the state's population _ and its power demands _ continued to grow. The result
was highlighted in a recent report by the California Independent System
Operator, which oversees most of the power grid. It predicted the state would 
be
nearly 6,000 megawatts short by June _ enough for 4.5 million homes.

??Despite PG&E's bankruptcy action, "the fundamentals haven't changed," said
California Public Utilities Commissioner Richard Bilas Saturday. "We haven't
enough supply and too much demand....It's not good. It really isn't."

??The market's vulnerability to manipulation

??That dearth of power is primarily responsible for driving up the price of
power, which heavily contributed to PG&E's financial troubles, since the rate 
it
has been permitted by law to charge its customers doesn't cover all its power
costs. But California officials accuse electricity suppliers of also
manipulating the energy market to help those prices rise.

??Among other things, the companies have been accused of switching off some of
their plants just before demand for power soars, to earn top dollar for the
electricity they produce from other plants. That charge has been vehemently
denied by suppliers. But state officials are suspicious, because in recent
months more than a fourth of the state's entire generating capacity has been 
out
of commission for what their operators claim was necessary maintenance.

??Erik Saltmarsh, chief counsel to the California Electricity Oversight Board,
said it's too early to know if PG&E's bankruptcy filing will make it easier or
harder for price gouging to occur.

??He noted that some power suppliers have characterized the high prices they
charged PG&E as a kind of risk premium, since they weren't sure the struggling
utility would repay them. Once the bankruptcy court stabilizes PG&E's 
financial
condition, Saltmarsh said, that excuse may vanish.

??But he said the filing also might prompt some suppliers to charge even 
higher
prices while the state buys power on PG&E's behalf, out of fear that the
bankruptcy proceedings might somehow limit that opportunity in the future.

??"I don't know what will happen," Saltmarsh said, "but I certainly wouldn't
take the position that our vulnerability to high charges just got reduced."

??The government's regulatory hodge podge

??Over the past few months, the state has quickly run up billions of dollars 
in
power bills, with no end in sight. Yet no single regulatory body is in charge 
of
making sure the state is getting its money's worth.

??As it is now, five separate state agencies oversee various critical aspects
of California's energy markets _ monitoring the flow of electricity, keeping
track of utility operations, approving new generators and purchasing power. 
Now,
a bankruptcy court will get into the act, as well. And some lawmakers are
pushing to create still another governmental body _ a power authority, which
could buy or build its own generating plants.

??But the one agency with the most clout over electricity suppliers and the
prices they charge _ the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission _ so far has
declined to do what state officials have begged it to do: punish companies
accused of charging too much. And despite PG&E's bankruptcy action, that
reluctance appears unlikely to change.

??"I personally am not sure the federal government should get involved" in 
such
matters, said Public Utilities Commissioner Henry Duque. "We're big boys and 
we
should be able to handle it ourselves."

??But the commission's president, Loretta Lynch, disagrees. In a statement she
issued in response to PG&E's bankruptcy announcement, she pointed out that
"neither the commission nor the governor has the power alone to change these
prices because the FERC has authority over California's wholesale energy
markets."

??The fickleness of Mother Nature

??Because of its razor thin electricity reserves, California is particularly 
at
the mercy of the weather, which hasn't been kind lately.

??A drought across the Pacific Northwest has severely reduced the amount of
water gushing through the hydro-electric dams that this state relies on for
power in emergencies. And that problem could be aggravated by hot weather this
summer.

??Last June, record temperatures were partly responsible for knocking out 
power
to about 100,000 Bay Area customers. This summer, that could be repeated. 
Citing
data from the National Weather Service, an organization that monitors power
supplies throughout the region _ the Western Systems Coordinating Council _
issued a report Friday that predicted "above-normal warmth" across the West.

??What's it all add up to? Even if PG&E eventually manages to restore its
financial health in bankruptcy court, the recent report by the Independent
System Operator was not optimistic about the state's immediate prospects. "
California," it concluded grimly, "is facing an electricity shortage of
unprecedented proportions."

bankruptcy on Friday:

???1996: Gov. Pete Wilson signs legislation making California the first state
to deregulate its electricity market.

???1998: PG&E and other utilities begin selling power plants, as required by
the deregulation law. The law caps rates until the utilities are divested of
plants, which was expected to take four years.

???1999: San Diego Gas & Electric sells its plants to private generators,
allowing the utility to raise its rates. Customers' bills triple within a year
as the utility passes on rising wholesale electric costs.

???June 15: As the electricity shortage begins, rolling blackouts hit San
Francisco.

???Aug. 2: Gov. Gray Davis calls for investigation into possible price
manipulation in the wholesale electricity market.

???Dec. 13: U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson orders suppliers to sell
electricity to power-strapped California to try to fend off blackouts.

???Dec. 15: The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approves a flexible rate
cap plan, but allows power suppliers to charge utilities more if they can 
prove
a higher price is warranted.

???2001

???Jan. 1: PG&E warns that it will run out of cash within three weeks unless
the state Public Utilities Commission raises rates 26 percent. PG&E shares 
drop
29 percent to a 52-week low of $12.

???Jan. 4: The PUC approves an emergency rate hike of 15 percent for PG&E
customers.

???Jan. 5: Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Services downgrade PG&E's
corporate parent, PG&E Corp., to a notch above "junk" status.

???Jan. 11: PG&E plans to lay off 1,000 employees as a cost-cutting move. The
PUC later forbids the utility to do so.

???Jan. 16: PG&E says it is days away from defaulting on more than $1 billion
in debts it must pay by Feb. 15. PUC Commissioner Carl Wood warns that the
utility's bankruptcy "is now a very real possibility."

???Jan. 17: PG&E defaults on $76 million worth of short-term debt. Gov. Davis 
signs an emergency order allowing the state to buy electricity under a plan to
prevent utility bankruptcies and additional blackouts.

???Jan. 19: Davis signs legislation allowing the state to spend as much as 
$400
million to buy electricity.

???Jan. 23: The Bush administration extends an emergency order first issued by
the Clinton administration directing electricity wholesalers to sell to
California.

???Jan. 27: Natural gas suppliers threaten to cut off PG&E because of the
utility's mounting debts.

???Jan. 29: PG&E threatens to default on $1.3 billion in debts unless 
creditors
grant extensions.

???Jan. 30: An independent audit reveals PG&E sent $682 million to its parent
company even as it sank deeper into debt.

requiring electricity wholesalers to sell to California. A federal judge in
Sacramento orders Reliant Energy to continue selling to the state.

???Feb. 16: Davis proposes a multibillion-dollar plan to restore financial
health to PG&E and two other investor-owned utilities by buying their power
lines.

???Feb. 23: Davis announces an "agreement in principle" with Southern
California Edison to buy its transmission lines for $2.7 billion. Negotiations
with PG&E soon falter over the price tag.

dollar.

???March 27: The PUC approves record rate increases of up to 46 percent for
Edison and PG&E customers.

???March 29: Davis asks lawmakers to approve spending another $500 million to
buy power for PG&E and other utilities, bringing the state's tab to $4.7
billion.

???April 5: Davis proposes relieving the utilities' debts by giving them a
share of the PUC's proposed rate increase. PG&E says the governor's remarks
offer no comprehensive solution to the power crisis.

???April 6: PG&E files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.

PG&E timed bankruptcy to blame Davis, insiders say

SOURCE: Chronicle Staff Writer

BYLINE: David Lazarus

BODY:
When Gov. Gray Davis took to the airwaves Thursday to explain how California 
was
going to solve its energy troubles, PG&E Corp. Chairman Robert Glynn was one 
of
the few who knew that things were about to get much, much worse.

???Without telling the governor -- and contrary to later explanations -- Glynn
had decided days earlier that Pacific Gas and Electric Co. would file for
bankruptcy protection Friday morning, sources within the utility said.

???Moreover, the timing of the move now seems to have been very deliberate.

???PG&E, observers say, seized the opportunity to declare bankruptcy Friday so
it could lay blame on the governor while also staying ahead of a breakthrough 
in
Davis' separate bailout talks with Southern California Edison -- a deal that
worked against PG&E's financial interests.

???The behind-the-scenes picture taking shape is that PG&E apparently realized
that it had no choice but to act on Friday.

???After months of bankruptcy preparations, this was the company's best chance
to minimize backlash from the filing, and PG&E scrambled to have everything in
place before the governor uttered a word.

???However, that's not how Glynn and other PG&E officials told the story.

???"We listened carefully to the (governor's) statement and the commentary 
that
followed, and this decision is the result," Glynn said Friday of why PG&E had
chosen to file for bankruptcy.

???Davis felt he'd been ambushed.

???The governor called Glynn on Friday night and expressed his deep
disappointment over PG&E's actions. Sources said the call did not go well, and
that a possibly insurmountable gulf had opened up between the state's top
politician and the head of its largest utility.

???"The governor was led to believe that we were dealing in good faith, and
clearly that was not the case," Steve Maviglio, Davis' spokesman, said
yesterday. "Instead of looking in the mirror, they pointed fingers."

???As Glynn told it, PG&E's talks with Davis had broken down weeks earlier.
"We've heard a lot of the words that have been involved but have not seen a 
lot
of actions," he said.

???By last week, the deal slowly taking shape between the utility and the 
state
had ballooned to almost incomprehensible complexity.

???What once had been a mere cash infusion for a troubled company now involved
public acquisition of power lines and land, changes in California's regulatory
laws, multibillion-dollar bond offerings and potentially huge rate increases 
for
consumers.

???Financial analysts who had been briefed on the status of the negotiations
after the governor's Thursday speech said it appeared that Davis was ready to 
do
virtually anything to keep PG&E from going bankrupt.

???PG&E SMELLED WEAKNESS

???But they said PG&E may have sensed that the governor had lost the political
clout to sell to lawmakers what was shaping up to be a very generous deal.

???"Although a reasonable deal could have been reached, it's unclear whether
all the parties in the state would have signed on," said Paul Patterson, an
energy-industry analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston in New York.

???Sources familiar with the talks said the negotiations reached an impasse
last month when PG&E demanded that the state Public Utilities Commission be
reorganized so that it would have less oversight authority over the utility's
activities.

???Such a change would have given PG&E almost free rein to raise its 13 
million
customers' rates any time the utility saw fit, the sources said. One called
PG&E's demand "a deal breaker."

???PG&E spokesman Ron Low denied yesterday that such a condition had been
sought. Rather, he said PG&E merely wanted written assurance that any 
agreement
reached with the governor "could not be undone by the PUC."

???Other sources cited a different turning point in the negotiations. They 
said
the talks began to disintegrate several weeks ago when Davis criticized PG&E 
and
other utilities for not making payments to smaller power companies that were
struggling to get by.

???"It is wrong and irresponsible of the utilities to pocket and withhold the
money," the governor said. "It's immoral and has to stop."

???PG&E's chief financial officer, Peter Darbee, reportedly told one of Davis'
negotiators that Glynn "took it personally" when PG&E was called "immoral."

???Whatever the reason, Glynn knew well before the governor's speech on
Thursday that his utility was going to file for bankruptcy.

???FILING 'READY TO GO'

???"We had this thing ready to go long before that," acknowledged PG&E
spokesman Greg Pruett.

???Indeed, PG&E had hired bankruptcy attorneys from the New York firm of Weil
Gotshal & Manges last August. Although the lawyers ostensibly had been 
retained
to help keep the utility from going bankrupt, their mission shifted as PG&E 
sank
deeper into debt.

???By early this year, sources within the utility said, the attorneys had 
drawn
up all necessary papers to file for bankruptcy at a moment's notice. The only
question was the timing.

???Many observers now believe that PG&E never intended to cut a bailout deal
with the governor. The utility made no secret of its displeasure with having 
to
sell off lucrative assets like power lines, land or dams.

???Moreover, PG&E executives appeared to sincerely believe that they were
entitled to recoup the entire $9 billion in debt accrued because of a rate
freeze that prevented the utility from passing along sky-high power costs to
customers.

???They had faith in a lawsuit pending in federal court that seeks to overturn
the rate freeze and allow full recovery of past expenses.

???But time was against PG&E. The utility's Southern California cousin, 
Edison,
was holding its own bailout talks with Davis, and, unlike PG&E, had found the
terms of the deal to its liking.

???In February, Edison reached a tentative accord with the governor to sell 
its
transmission lines to the state for nearly $2.8 billion.

???Now, the negotiators say, a final deal may be just a few days away,
including an agreement for Edison to drop its own lawsuit seeking recovery of
past costs.

???EDISON DEAL POSED PROBLEMS

???If so, this would have been a big headache for PG&E. Among other problems,
it would have been an enormous challenge, to say the least, to publicly defend
pursuit of its federal lawsuit when Edison had announced that such legal 
tactics
were unnecessary.

???"It's possible they would be seen as a spoiler if Edison has a deal in 
place
and then PG&E filed for bankruptcy," said CS First Boston's Patterson.

???"They'd been looking at bankruptcy for months," he also said. "They looked
at the political landscape and decided this was the best way to go."

???The looming Edison deal added extra urgency to PG&E's bankruptcy timing. If
PG&E waited until this week to file, it risked the governor announcing a final
agreement with Edison as early as tomorrow.

???Observers said that risk, as well as the opportunity for finger-pointing
provided by Davis' Thursday night speech, gave PG&E almost no choice but to
schedule its bankruptcy filing for Friday morning.

???Once the filing date had been settled on, PG&E set the bankruptcy wheels in
motion.

???"These things take time to put together from the moment you decide to do
it," said PG&E spokesman Pruett.

???BONUS HANDOUTS

???Among other considerations, Glynn wanted to hand out bonuses and raises to
about 6,000 managers and other employees at the utility and its parent 
company.

???Such a move would be more difficult after the bankruptcy filing had been
made. The bankruptcy judge could even forbid it.

???Backtracking from a previous decision not to hand out bonuses this year,
Glynn told PG&E workers in an internal memo late Thursday that he had changed
his mind.

???Bonuses and raises would be awarded, he said, because of workers' "efforts,
teamwork and dedication during the past year, and particularly throughout the
ongoing energy crisis."

???Next, PG&E had to orchestrate the actual filing and its subsequent fallout.
Securities regulators were informed that the company had an important
announcement pending, and trading in PG&E's stock was immediately halted.

???Employees were informed of the bankruptcy move in an e-mail message sent 
out
at 9:30 a.m., followed by a town hall-style meeting in the corporate 
auditorium
15 minutes later.

???Glynn and Gordon Smith, PG&E's chief executive, then spoke by telephone 
with
reporters, followed by a full day of one-on-one interviews to hammer home the
company's message.

???CRITICISM OF NEGOTIATORS

???In one such interview, Glynn reiterated to CNBC that "the governor's
negotiators have moved away from previous agreements that we had reached with
them."

???He also faulted state regulators for having taken "negative actions" that
jeopardized PG&E's financial position -- an unusual argument for a utility
already $9 billion in the hole.

???Meanwhile, the company's spinmeisters issued "talking points" for employees
so they too could communicate PG&E's stance. It advised them to say bankruptcy
was "in the best interests of our customers, employees, suppliers, debt 
holders
and shareholders."

???Going forward, PG&E has two weeks in which to compile all the necessary
paperwork supporting its filing, and will then schedule subsequent 
developments
with Federal Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali.

???The process, which could last years, ultimately will provide a framework 
for
PG&E's creditors to recover at least a portion of the money owed them, and 
will
allow the utility to continue operating in an otherwise normal manner.

???PG&E said it foresees no disruptions of service or layoffs of employees.

???RATES COULD SKYROCKET

???However, customers' rates could go through the roof if the bankruptcy judge
decides that consumers should shoulder the utility's $9 billion debt burden.

???In the meantime, PG&E is continuing efforts to persuade customers to use
less power in the face of severe electricity shortages this summer, including 
TV
ads promoting conservation.

???One such ad is scheduled to run in the Bay Area tonight during a showing of
"The Ten Commandments," in which Moses leads his people through the desert and
to the promised land.

???Glynn, now leading his company through the wilderness of bankruptcy, can
only be hoping to be as fortunate.E-mail David Lazarus at

HEADLINE: Davis' Pledges Come Back To Haunt Him

SOURCE: Chronicle Staff Writers

BYLINE: Carla Marinucci, Patrick Hoge

BODY:
In January, Gov. Gray Davis stood before the Legislature for his State of the
State address and delivered a definitive vow -- and a devastating prediction.

???"To utilities and the financial community, let me say this: I reject the
irresponsible notion that we can afford to allow our major utilities to go
bankrupt," he said. "Our fate is tied to their fate."

???Davis painted a chaotic picture of what could follow: "Bankruptcy would 
mean
that millions of Californians would be subject to electricity blackouts. 
Public
safety would be jeopardized. Businesses would close. Jobs would be lost.
Investment would flee the state. And our economy would suffer a devastating
blow."

???But on Friday, the event Davis called unthinkable came to pass as the
state's largest utility declared bankruptcy just hours after the governor
delivered his first televised address to the state on the energy crisis.

???The dramatic move by Pacific Gas and Electric Co. -- that many saw as a 
slap
in Davis' face -- highlighted what critics say are the California governor's
worst political liabilities: an overly cautious, controlling nature and a
tendency to focus on protecting political turf with easy promises.

???In this situation, it meant Davis promised no rate increases for consumers
while pursuing a bailout strategy to force the utility to give up one of its
prized assets, its network of transmission lines.

???"Most men never have a chance to write their own epitaphs. But Gray 
provided
the language for his political gravestone," said GOP consultant Dan Schnur, a
former top aide to Davis' predecessor, Republican Pete Wilson. "He did it all 
by
himself."

???Davis' defenders say the governor deserves credit during the past months of
the state's energy crisis for steadfastly seeking a plan that would protect
average California consumers.

???"Davis does get some points for fighting off the rate increase for awhile,"
said Bruce Cain, political science professor at the University of California 
at
Berkeley.

???Bob Mulholland, campaign adviser to the state Democratic Party, said the
governor is the captain in a classic battle between Democratic populism and 
the
big oil-and-energy interests who control wholesale electricity prices.

???"The Texas boys have California right where they want us," he said. "PG&E
declares Chapter 11 bankruptcy while they're eating filet mignons."

???Others, however, say Davis has single-mindedly pursued unrealistic options
that have caused delay and greater financial fallout.

???They point to Davis' insistence since January that PG&E sell its
transmission lines in exchange for cash to pay off its debts, an option the
company always disliked. Southern California Edison in late February signed a
tentative $2.8 billion deal to sell its transmission lines, and some speculate
that Davis hoped PG&E would cave in and do the same.

???Despite its reluctance, PG&E officials said they agreed to sell the lines 
in
a handshake deal with a top Davis negotiator in late February. But the state
quickly backed away from the deal, said Dan Richard, a PG&E senior vice
president.

???At the same time, Richard said, the governor was publicly chastising the
utility for its actions and the Davis-controlled Public Utilities Commission 
was
issuing rulings the company felt jeopardized its economic survival.

???PG&E Corp. Chairman Robert Glynn said that for the three critical weeks in
March, PG&E had no negotiations at all with the Davis administration.

???Finally, on March 27, Glynn called the governor and spoke with Davis --
warning him that the firm was as close as it ever had been to filing 
bankruptcy.

???A top Davis negotiator last Monday requested that PG&E officials come to
Sacramento for a meeting -- and another Davis adviser told the company it 
would
probably not like what was being offered, Richard said. PG&E representatives
were presented with a proposal they felt was a major step back, Richard said.

???Despite PG&E's displeasure, on Wednesday Davis met with the Assembly
Republican caucus and reported that negotiations with PG&E were going well,
according to legislators at the meeting. When asked, Davis reportedly 
downplayed
the possibility of bankruptcy proceedings.

???DAVIS IN TOUCH?

???"It makes you want to consider whether or not the governor's office is
really in touch with the crisis," said Jamie Fisfis, a spokesman for Assembly
Republican leader Dave Cox, R-Fair Oaks.

???Davis' own declarations have eroded his credibility, Fisfis said.

???"No rate increases . . . no bankruptcies," Fisfis said. "Those things have
come to pass."

???Said Assemblyman Keith Richman, R-Northridge: "The governor was strongly
focused on the political expediency of not raising rates, and was taking a
stance that was completely unrealistic."

???Davis' micromanaging style also allowed for no bipartisan cooperation,
Fisfis said.

???"He didn't really give us an opportunity to participate or assist, because
he kept everything secret," Fisfis said.

???Even some in Davis' own party have become increasingly vocal in their
criticism.

???ARITHMETIC FAULTY

???Assemblyman Dean Florez, D-Shafter, said the arithmetic laid out in the
governor's proposals apparently did not add up for PG&E, providing neither
enough money to buy power in the future, nor to pay off its debt.

???Florez -- who has sponsored a bill to help utilities pay off past debts --
said legislators probably will begin pursuing their own proposals, some of 
which
were shelved to give the governor a chance to do it his way.

???Davis "may have locked himself in too early by saying we can do this 
without
a rate increase," Florez said. "That is what made this thing really impossible
to deal with."

???Garry South, Davis' senior political adviser, argued that critics should
focus their wrath not on Davis, but on the arrogance and greed of big 
utilities.

???"The governor cannot hold a gun to PG&E's temple and force them to a deal,"
said South. "He is only one player in this drama, and unfortunately, he 
doesn't
control most of the other players."

???In the most recent negotiations, South said PG&E demanded that Davis
"basically agree to all of their conditions, forgive all their past debts,
forget the fact that they brought this thing on themselves (by supporting
deregulation), bail them out with the taxpayers' money . . . and hold them
harmless."

???South insisted that consumers understand. "The governor's standing with the
public has held up," he said, "because people view him as having the interests
of the consumer at heart -- of not caving into big utility companies."

???VOTERS' PATIENCE UNKNOWN

???Critics say the real question is how much patience voters will have for
Davis, who faces re-election in 19 months, as the crisis unfolds.

???But UC's Cain said Davis is still a strong favorite for re-election 
"because
of the weakness of the opposition, and the inability of Republicans to say
they've got a better idea."

???And Davis' $26 million (war chest) will buy "a lot of ads," Cain said, "to
point out what Pete Wilson and the Republicans did to introduce this thing in
the first place."

???"Our Fate Is Tied to Their Fate"

???- Gov. Gray Davis, State of the State Address, Jan. 8, 2001

???"I reject the irresponsible notion that we can afford to allow our major
utilities to go bankrupt."

???Jan. 8

???Even as Gov. Gray Davis worked to solve the energy crisis and prevent
utility bankruptcies, PG&E was moving closer to the brink. -- PG&E stock 
prices:

???Jan. 1: $17

???Jan. 8: $14 (State of the State Address)

???Jan. 17: $9.63 (The day Davis announced the state would begin buying
electricity on behalf of utilities.)

???Feb. 22: $14.55

???March 28: $13.20

???April 6: $7.20 (The day PG&E filed for bankruptcy.)

???"If we can assure Californians there's a reliable source of power, at an
attractive low rate, then I think they can see light at the end of the 
tunnel."

???Jan. 9 -- Power alerts: California was under a Stage 1, 2 or 3 alert for 41
consecutive days from Jan. 13 to Feb. 22. -- Energy costs: Davis signed
emergency legislation on Jan. 29 setting aside $400 million for what was to 
be a
short-term plan to buy electricity directly from power generators.

???The cost kept rising:

???By the end of January: $535 million.

???By the end of February: $2.8 billion

???By April 6: about $4 billion.

???"The goal is to buy power California needs. There will be no rate
increases."

???Jan. 13 -- Rate hikes: The Public Utilities Commission approved an average
40 percent rate hike on March 27. Davis on April 5 suggested a slightly 
smaller
increase of an average of 37 percent and said half of all households would see
no increase.

HEADLINE: Nuclear Warning;

Watchdogs eye Duke's salvage operation

SOURCE: Chronicle Staff Writers

BYLINE: Scott Winokur, Christian Berthelsen

BODY:
Robin Mills, a Washington, D.C., handyman, and Dick Sears, a Winston-Salem,
N.C., professor, have little in common besides their mutual distrust of the
company whose stock both own, Duke Energy Corp., and they say Californians
should know why they're down on their investment.

???While Duke may serve its 396,000 shareholders well and have Wall Street's
admiration, it's also a company, Mills and Sears say, that will openly defy 
the
government on vital but costly air-pollution measures and move ahead with a
risky nuclear program no other energy producer would touch.

???Duke, the third-largest U.S. utility, acquired three Pacific Gas and
Electric Co. plants in 1998 and today accounts for about 5 percent of
California's power. It plans to expand in the Golden State.

???In recent shareholder resolutions, Mills and Sears accused Duke of 
polluting
the air by burning coal, and of jeopardizing the safety of millions in the
Southeast by proceeding despite fierce opposition with a plan to convert
plutonium warheads to nuclear fuel.

???Sears' antipollution resolution, introduced in November, came a month 
before
the Environmental Protection Agency charged the company and others with 
numerous
violations of the federal Clean Air Act. The pollution that Duke allegedly
caused, the government said, was responsible for increased sickness and
mortality from lung disorders among residents of the Southeastern United 
States.

???"I went to the emergency room twice last summer. I didn't know what was
happening to me," said Nina Layton, 53, of Charlotte, N.C., where Duke is
headquartered. "My asthma doctor said the coal-fired plants were one of the 
main
culprits."

???Duke denied the federal charges, saying it will defend itself vigorously.

???Energy-industry watchdogs and concerned shareholders say that Duke warrants
close scrutiny from California consumers, regulators and elected officials
seeking solutions to the state's energy problems without eroding the high
standards that have made it the nation's environmental pacesetter.

???Today, California may be an environmentally by-the-book state where new
plants run by coal and nuclear sources -- which account for 98 percent of the
fuel Duke uses nationwide, about equally divided -- are economically 
impractical
or close to unthinkable, legally and politically. But no one can say how its
energy needs will shape public opinion and government policy in the future.

???"If I were a resident of California, I wouldn't want to give a large
economic interest in the state's energy market to them (Duke) because we know
their policy: To fight pollution-control efforts," said David Hawkins, 
director
of the air and energy program of the Natural Resources Defense Council in
Washington, D.C.

???Coal-fired generation of electricity is legal in California, although
environmental laws and the state's lack of coal pose costly obstacles.

???No nuclear plants have been licensed here since Diablo Canyon (near San 
Luis
Obispo) in the early 1970s, but the technology remains attractive to the
industry, despite debacles at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl, because nuclear
plants don't pose emissions problems common to fossil-fuel plants.

???According to Claudia Chandler, spokeswoman for the California Energy
Commission, state law says no nuclear plants may be built until a safe way to
dispose of nuclear waste is found.

???While there is no legal reason Duke couldn't build coal-fired facilities in
California, the nuclear option is unlikely right now. That could change if the
radioactive waste problem were solved or de-emphasized due to the need for 
more
power.

???"The winds seem to be shifting politically. I'm sure they're considering
their options," said Barbara Puklin Silverman, an energy analyst for Arnold & 
S.
Bleichroeder of New York.

???DUKE CLAIMS TO OBEY RULES

???Company spokeswoman Cathy Roche said Duke will rely on natural gas to fuel
three of its California plants (a fourth in Oakland's Inner Harbor runs on
diesel). She dismissed attacks on Duke's plutonium project as the criticism of
"a very small group of antinuclear activists who will go as far as they can to
shut down that option."

???Roche said blame for air pollution in the Southeast should be laid on the
auto industry, other industries and power plants in other states, particularly
those in Tennessee. She pointed to honors Duke has won from financial
publications and its consistently high customer-satisfaction ratings.

???"We do very tenaciously defend our record when we have complied with the
rules," Roche said, with reference to Duke's reputation for litigiousness when
challenged or resisted by regulators and private citizens -- a reputation that
hasn't dimmed its luster on Wall Street.

???"The company has been one of the best-regarded builders and operators of
power plants in the country and one of the early movers in the merchant energy
business created through the deregulation," said Thomas Hamlin of First Union
Securities in Richmond, Va.

???In recent months, Duke's stock has been selling in the low to mid-40s, near
the top of its trading range -- and up more than 50 percent from last year.

???'IT MAKES ME COUGH'

???Duke says California's environmental laws and other regulatory hurdles are
why more than 25 percent of its generation capacity in the state frequently 
has
been unavailable. Chief Executive Officer Richard Priory blames 
special-interest
groups in California. He told the Winston-Salem Journal, hometown paper of one
of North Carolina's polluted cities, "(I)n the Carolinas, we're committed to
getting it right."

???But what's "right" for the Carolinas is far from clear.

???"It makes me cough a whole lot more, and coughing is what upsets my lungs,"
said Virginia Richardson of Winston-Salem, who lives near Duke's coal-fired
Belews Creek plant, one of the company's dirtiest.

???Richardson, 70, has a chronic lung condition that gets worse, she said, 
when
the plant is spewing emissions.

???"I notice smells in the area. Sometimes the air looks foggy, smoky or
whatever. I come in the house," Richardson said. "It's the same stuff over and
over, shortness of breath, I get tired, I get bad colds in the wintertime."

???Clay Ballantine, a physician at a large hospital in Asheville that serves 
22
counties in western North Carolina, said that during the summer of 1999, one 
of
the worst in local memory for pollution, he treated at least a half-dozen
patients for severe respiratory problems. They later sold their second homes 
in
the Blue Ridge Mountains and returned to their home states. A dozen other
physicians on the staff treated similar numbers, he said.

???"The tourists come here thinking they'll get clean mountain air, and they
end up with flareups of normally stable breathing problems they had before --
with severe asthma and emphysema," Ballantine said.

???"We're seeing more lung disease than when I came here four years ago,"
Ballantine added. "My opinion is the emissions from the coal-fired power 
plants
are the main correctable variable."

???A study published in October tabulated the death and disease caused by air
pollution from all sources, focusing in part on pollution from coal-fired 
plants
such as Duke's.

???The study was conducted by a private consultant, Abt Associations of
Cambridge, Mass., for Clear the Air, a joint project of the Clean Air Task
Force, the National Environmental Trust and the U.S. Public Interest Research
Group Education Fund. Among its findings:

???-- California, which has relatively few coal, oil and diesel plants, ranked
46th in per capita deaths from power-plant pollution. North and South 
Carolina,
where Duke's eight coal-fired plants are situated, ranked 6th and 7th,
respectively.

???-- An estimated 1,800 North Carolinians die each year from power-plant
pollution, compared with an estimated 259 in California, which has a 
population
4.2 times larger.

???-- Two North Carolina cities -- Charlotte and Greensboro -- rank among the
nation's worst in annual incidence of deaths, asthma attacks and
hospitalizations attributable to power-plant pollution.

???A third city, Asheville, has the nation's sixth-highest rate of deaths
related to power plant pollution, the study found. Asheville Mayor Leni 
Sitnick
said her tourism-dependent city faces economic doom unless the pollution 
problem
is solved.

???COMPANY CRITICS SILENCED

???Sears' antipollution measure, proposed Nov. 10, never received a public
hearing. Duke told him Feb. 19 that, with the approval of the Securities and
Exchange Commission, it would refuse to put it before the annual shareholders'
meeting in Charlotte on April 26.

???Mills' antinuclear resolution, opposed by Duke in repeated legal 
objections,
expired during a two-year period and eventually was removed from the ballot,
despite the support of thousands of shareholders, among them Peter Gill Wylie,
great-grandson of one of the company's founders.

???In an interview, Wylie said that when Mills' antiplutonium measure failed a
second time last year, he began to sell his large holdings of stock in the
company.

???"It's very scary to me," Wylie said, "that if Duke makes one wrong step, 
not
only would potentially millions of people be hurt, but the stock would be
worthless."

???The dissident shareholders say there's a lesson for California in their
experiences.

???"You have to be very careful with them. They're willing to use their 
lawyers
wherever and whenever they need to," Mills said.

???'ARROGANCE OF POWER'

???A 22,000-employee company with a global reach (it has done work in more 
than
50 countries), Duke is accustomed to having a free hand in North Carolina,
political observers in the South say, because it has been a big employer 
(10,128
people are on its payroll in the state) and liberal-spending political
powerhouse there for decades.

???Bob Hull, research director for Democracy South, a Chapel Hill, N.C.,
watchdog group, said North Carolina's political culture has encouraged big
businesses like Duke to assert themselves in ways not seen elsewhere.

???"Unlike other states that have found government a hindrance," Hull said,
"North Carolina has had a hegemony of industrial, financial and agricultural
interests that have used government as an engine. Duke has been a part of that
for decades."

???As an example, critics point to Duke's pressure on then-Gov. Jim Hunt in
October to lobby state officials to set a lower overall air-pollution standard
than more than 11,000 residents said they wanted in hearings. Higher standards
result in fewer pollution-related deaths, data show.

???In exchange for a weaker and less costly standard, Duke -- which had teamed
up with the state's other large utility, Carolina Power & Light -- agreed to
show restraint. It said it would not sue the state if the tougher standard was
set aside. It got its way.

???Duke's Roche, backed by the chairman of the North Carolina Environmental
Management Commission, David Moreau, denied allegations that the company
pressured Hunt improperly.

???But environmental commissioner Bob Epting, a Chapel Hill, N.C., lawyer who
voted against the lower standard, told local reporters that Hunt, Duke and 
CP&L
had made a backdoor and backroom deal. Five months later, he's still angry.

???"It abused the dignity of the commission and spat in the face of the
citizens," Epting told The Chronicle. "It reflects the arrogance of unfettered
power, whether in the governor's office or the Duke presidential suite.

???"To the extent you permit that in California, Duke will do the same thing
there," he added. "The people of California ought to be on the lookout.

???"There's never been anybody at Duke," Epting asserted, "who stood up and
said, 'We're going to make the environment as important as our bottom line.' I
don't know there ever will be."

???DUKE'S POLITICAL DONATIONS

???Duke has one of the two largest corporate political action committees in
North Carolina; CP&L has the other. Together, they donated more than $1.5
million to candidates and measures in North Carolina between 1989 and 1998, 
and
more than $100,000 to Hunt since 1990, including donations from executives and
lobbyists, according to Democracy South.

???In California, Duke donated $14,000 on Aug. 3 to Gov. Gray Davis, state 
Sen.
Debra Bowen, D-Marina del Rey, chair of the Senate Energy Committee, and to 
the
Senate Democratic Leadership Fund.

???Duke also pumped money into a ballot measure in Morro Bay (San Luis Obispo
County), where it plans a controversial plant modernization opposed by a group
of local residents. The company spent nearly $13,000 in support of an 
initiative
that called for approval of the project. It spent an additional $4,300 backing
state Sen. Jack O'Connell, D-Santa Barbara/San Luis Obispo, who endorsed it.
O'Connell is a member of the state Senate Committee on Environmental Quality.
The measure passed.

???"Morro Bay is a beautiful place to live," said resident Jack McCurdy, a
founder of the anti-Duke Coastal Alliance, "but it's spoiled, having to live
with Duke and the people they bought off."

???O'Connell said: "Any attempt to link any contribution to my position on the
ballot measure is absurd and laughable. The project is sound. We're in an 
energy
crisis. A clear majority in the community understands that."

???But McCurdy's group claims the plant, fueled by natural gas, will put an
additional 76 tons of particulate matter into the air, an amount equivalent to
more than 300 percent of all emissions produced each year by diesel buses in 
the
Bay Area. Particulates are particles small enough to enter and lodge in the
lungs.

???McCurdy said health hazards to children, who will be attending school close
to the new facility, will increase, water quality will deteriorate and marine
life will die. The bay is one of three California estuaries protected by the
Clean Water Act's National Estuary Program.

???The Coastal Alliance calls the plant there now "a moral and ethical
abomination" and contends Duke wants to make a bad situation significantly
worse.

???"They have sought and pretty much succeeded in making Morro Bay a company
town," said McCurdy, a retired Los Angeles Times reporter.

???With the assistance of Santa Barbara's Environmental Defense Center, a
public-interest legal group, the Coastal Alliance plans to fight Duke's Morro
Bay expansion project before the California Energy Commission as it proceeds
through the review process this year.

???Duke says the Morro Bay project will meet all the requirements of state and
federal law and use the best available technology to lower smog levels.

???'A PUTRID HALO'

???Epting, the environmental commissioner, is a pilot who flies a small plane
over the central part of North Carolina.

???"You can see an orangish-yellow plume that connects these plants. It's a
putrid halo that sits over the top of Chapel Hill, Raleigh, Greensboro and
Charlotte. That's what these companies give us," he said.

???But state regulators have not found much to complain about, at least with
regard to Duke. Environmentalists say that's because they haven't looked hard
enough.

???"Nobody here is doing anything about this," said Janet Zeller of the Blue
Ridge Environmental Defense League in Glendale Springs, N.C.

???North Carolina air-quality official Mike Aldrich contended that wasn't the
case.

???"Sometimes they'll make you make them do it right," Aldrich said of Duke, 
"but they will do it right."

???The federal government's experience has been different.

???In December, the Justice Department took Duke to court on behalf of the 
EPA,
which had failed to persuade the company to bring its eight coal-fired plants 
in
the Carolinas into compliance with the Clean Air Act.

???The government charged Duke with more than 50 violations punishable by 
fines
upward of $25,000 a day, saying the company had gone at least a decade without
installing costly equipment to control power-plant emissions containing sulfur
dioxide, nitrogen dioxides and particulates.

???While the suit's ultimate fate may be uncertain under the Bush
administration, environmental groups and power company watchdogs in the
Southeast see it as confirmation of what they have been saying for years.

???DUKE NUKE REBUKE

???Under a controversial federal program, Duke is the only energy company with
a lucrative government contract (it comes with a $130 million credit) to 
dispose
of plutonium, a byproduct of disarmament. Its partners in the contract are
French energy company Cogema and a U.S. plutonium-facility contractor, Stone &
Webster.

???The radioactive waste would be salvaged near Georgia's second-largest city,
Augusta, at a secured 300-square-mile Energy Department site on the Savannah
River in Aiken, S.C., from decommissioned plutonium warheads shipped from
Amarillo, Texas.

???It would be mixed with uranium to form MOX, mixed oxide fuel, then used at
Duke facilities close to Charlotte -- one of which, the McGuire Nuclear 
Station
on Lake Norman, sits amid planned residential communities partly developed by 
a
Duke-owned real estate company.

???Construction, under a contract with the federal Energy Department's 
National
Nuclear Security Agency, is scheduled to begin in 2003; operations are 
expected
to continue through 2022, when the lethal leftovers of the nuclear arms race
have been consumed.

???Roche said the company has a good record on its nuclear operations and was
invited to run the MOX program because the government has confidence in it.

???But critics call the project economically and environmentally risky, as 
well
as a magnet for terrorists, because recycled plutonium can be converted back 
to
weapons-grade materiel with relative ease.

???"It's going to be a fiasco," said Mills, the Duke shareholder, a onetime
electrician on a nuclear submarine who inherited stock and uses it as a paper
pulpit for his clean-energy views. "The question in California is: Will they
expand by building nuclear?"

???Paul Gunter, director of the Reactor Watchdog Project for the Nuclear
Information and Referral Service in Washington, D.C., predicted that as
California continues to map out long-term plans to address its energy needs,
nuclear-powered generation inevitably will be a focal point.

???Notwithstanding barriers to development now in place, he said, plutonium
fuel and the substantial hazards that accompany nuclear energy may become 
major
concerns in the state.

???Zeller of the Blue Ridge group said it's unlikely the Savannah River
project, if completed, can be confined to the two North Carolina plants Duke 
says it now has in mind for MOX fuel.

???"It's absurd for anyone to believe this plutonium factory at Savannah River
is for just those reactors," she said. "These are the first phase. Others will
be slated for weapons-grade plutonium. Where? Nobody knows. Every state with a
nuclear power plant better be interested."

??-----------------------------------

??Duke Exerts Energy in Business and Politics

???-- About the company: Duke Energy is a multinational energy company 
composed
of 14 operating units. It entered California July 1, 1998, with Duke Energy
North America's purchase of 2,645 megawatts of production from PG&E. Duke 
generates 3,450 megawatts in Oakland, Moss Landing (Monterey County), Morro 
Bay
(San Luis Obispo County) and Chula Vista (San Diego County), accounting for
about 5 percent of the state's electricity. It plans to add 1,560 megawatts at
these plants, which run primarily on natural gas. The company employs about
22,000 people in more than 50 countries, including more than 1,000 in
California.

???-- Financial performance: It has $58 billion in assets. Revenue in 2000 was
more than $49 billion, up 127 percent from 1999; earnings per share were a
record $4.20, up 17 percent. It was the second-highest-ranking company for
return on equity on the Dow Jones utility average in 2000. The stock is held 
by
the top seven utilities mutual funds and given second-highest overall 
weighting
in those funds, according to Morningstar of Chicago. By the end of 2000, 
shares
were worth 70 percent more than when the year began.

???-- Political spending: DukePAC, the company's political action committee,
more than tripled its donations to U.S. House and Senate candidates in
the1999-2000 election cycle, with House Republican candidates receiving 
$39,000
from Duke in 1997-98, more than twice as much as Democrats. Senate Republican
hopefuls, including Matt Fong of California, got $2,500, compared with $1,750
donated to Democrats. During the next election, however, Duke's donations grew
enormously. House Republicans received $93,875 and House Democrats $55,000;
Senate Republicans received $33,000, Democrats $9,500. In California, Duke 
donated comparatively small amounts last summer to Gov. Gray Davis, state 
Senate
Energy Committee Chairwoman Debra Bowen, D-Marina del Rey (Los Angeles 
County),
and the Senate Democratic Leadership Fund. The company spent $126,394 on
lobbying in Sacramento in 1999-2000.

???-- CEO compensation: CEO Richard Priory's 1999 pay package totaled more 
than
$2 million; a salary increase, $1.9 million bonus and other compensation 
pushed
it to $3.2 million in 2000. Both years exclude value of stock holdings,
including options, which vary in value depending on market conditions. Priory
exercised stock options and sold shares Nov. 1-2 that netted him more than $1
million.Chronicle librarian Charles Malarkey contributed to this report. /

PG&E balking at Davis' plan
POWER CRISIS 
The utility threatens to take legal action if it is forced to reimburse 
alternative energy producers and the state 
By Andrew LaMar
TIMES STAFF WRITER 
SACRAMENTO -- Pacific Gas & Electric raised the threat of legal action Friday 
if the Davis administration follows through with a plan that would force the 
ailing utility to cough up money to alternative energy producers as well 
repay the state for its power purchases. 
The strident stance caught some state officials off guard and led one of Gov. 
Gray Davis' advisers to label it "negotiating in the paper." The two sides 
have squared off for more than a month to try to hammer out an agreement that 
would rescue PG&E from its mounting debt. 
The company's resistance to plans that emerged this week in proposed 
legislation and a prospective order to be considered Tuesday by the Public 
Utilities Commission further complicates a difficult situation that appears 
to be growing more tense by the day. 
"These actions approach the problem in a piecemeal and uncoordinated fashion 
and would force us to pay out far more than we collect in rates, further 
exacerbating an already precarious financial situation," said Gordon R. 
Smith, president and chief executive of PG&E. "The numbers just don't work." 
Company spokesman John Nelson said he could not specify which options the 
utility might pursue. 
And while Smith promised to continue to work with state officials on a 
solution, he said: "We have a duty to our suppliers, lenders and shareholders 
to protect the assets of the utility, and we must challenge any action by the 
state to force us to pay out more than is collected in rates." 
Creditors could petition to take Southern California Edison or PG&E into 
bankruptcy at any moment, and some say their patience for a state solution is 
wearing thin. 
Lawmakers moved quickly this week to rescue the alternative generators, known 
as qualifying facilities, after many shut down Monday and helped trigger two 
days of rolling blackouts. The facilities range from geothermal operations 
and wind turbines to natural gas-burning co-generation plants. They produce 
about 30 percent of the state's energy needs this time of year. 
The qualifying facilities quit running because they no longer had cash to pay 
employees and buy goods to keep their plants operating. Southern California 
Edison and PG&E have not paid the facilities for months, and they are owed 
$1.5 billion. 
A bill by Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Santa Cruz, sought to give the PUC 
authority to order utility companies to pay the qualifying facilities in 
advance. The measure also would direct utility companies to pay back the 
Department of Water Resources, which has bought power for them since 
mid-January, before paying back others. 
The legislation passed the Senate but stalled in the Assembly, where 
Republicans objected to the haste of the action, among other concerns. On 
Friday, Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys, said Democrats and 
Republicans would work through the weekend to come up with a plan that could 
win passage Monday. 
Meanwhile, Smith said the approach contained in the legislation would make 
PG&E's finances even worse. The company is collecting $400 million in bills 
each month but owes $1.4 billion a month for energy purchases. 
On Tuesday, Davis called PG&E's and Edison's practice of collecting bills 
from their customers to pay the qualifying facilities and not forwarding the 
money "immoral." On Friday, Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor 
had nothing more to add. 
Joseph Fichera, a member of the governor's team of advisers negotiating with 
utility companies, said PG&E's refusal to fully pay qualifying facilities 
leads the facilities to shut down, which in turn forces the state to find the 
energy elsewhere. 
"They are still collecting and not paying out the full amount," Fichera said. 
"The consequences of that is that it increases the amount of power the state 
has to buy on the spot market and creates a bigger problem for everybody." 
Fichera said negotiations with Edison and PG&E would continue through the 
weekend. He said there's nothing wrong with PG&E articulating its position, 
but company officials have misjudged the plan and should keep in mind the PUC 
will proceed on the qualifying facilities order in a way the company's 
finances can work. 
"They need to get the QFs online," Fichera said. "They need to see the bigger 
picture that (having) the QFs offline is exacerbating a problem we call 
summer."

A lone voice for price caps: U.S. regulator fears 'a disaster'
By David Whitney
Bee Washington Bureau 
(Published March 24, 2001) 
WASHINGTON -- William Massey used to be a team player. Then the lights 
started flickering in California. 
Now, Massey is the dissenting voice of the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission -- a preacher, an absolute convert to the idea that free markets 
be damned because California is getting a raw deal. 
Wholesale electricity prices are rocketing into the stratosphere. Gov. Gray 
Davis, joined by the governors of Oregon and Washington, is screaming for 
price controls. And yet Massey said his colleagues wouldn't do their job to 
ensure "just and reasonable" prices and rein in price gougers. 
"I fear a disaster is in the making," Massey told a House subcommittee this 
week. He said that without price controls this summer, he fears the worst. 
Massey isn't just pounding the table at congressional hearings. In recent 
orders by the commission, he has been the lone naysayer, uttering in strong 
terms the doom and gloom that will be thrust upon the state by an agency he 
says is refusing to follow the Federal Power Act's mandate that it enforce 
just and reasonable wholesale rates. 
Two weeks ago, Massey condemned as insufficient the commission's order 
finding that a dozen or so power producers may have overcharged California by 
as much as $69 million for January power sales. 
Massey called the commission action "facially arbitrary, capricious and an 
abuse of discretion." Massey said his colleagues only focused on power sales 
above $273 a megawatt-hour sold during Stage 3 alerts of imminent rolling 
blackouts. 
"There is no logic to this methodology other than limiting the universe of 
potential refunds," Massey wrote. 
Asked about this at the House hearing, Massey was even more pointed. When it 
comes to ferreting out price gougers, Massey said the message is that "FERC 
is going to be looking for the wallet under the lamp post with the lights 
shining, and nowhere else." 
These are welcome words to beleaguered state officials and utility executives 
who are growing increasingly frustrated that neither the commission nor the 
Bush administration seems to be heeding the concerns of California and the 
West over the worsening power situation. 
"Commissioner Massey has a very good understanding," said an appreciative 
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, author of price-control legislation that Massey has 
endorsed. 
Joe Nipper, senior vice president of the American Public Power Association, 
said the fact that Massey is alone in advocating firmer protection for 
California and its consumers makes his role even more important. 
"Thank God he is there to articulate that point of view because if he 
weren't, you wouldn't hear it at all," Nipper said. 
Massey concedes that his role as commission dissenter is new. In his eight 
years on the commission, the former legal services lawyer and aide to retired 
Arkansas Democratic Sen. Dale Bumpers has been known more as a team player. 
Nominated by President Clinton for the post in 1993, Massey was fully behind 
the notion that free and open markets were the way to go in the energy 
business. 
When California's electric deregulation package started rolling through the 
agency in 1996, Massey was right there, urging it on, proclaiming the glories 
of open competition. 
"It's true that as the commission has marched toward competition in the open 
markets, I've been there in a leadership role," Massey said during an 
interview. 
Several Midwest shortages during a 1998 heat wave were the first indications 
that something was amiss. Massey said he was skeptical about the prevailing 
view on the commission that the Midwest problem was the result of "the 
confluence of a series of circumstances that were unlikely to recur, the 
so-called perfect storm." 
"I thought that was a naive statement," he said. 
But Massey said this didn't shake his confidence in deregulation and 
market-based competition so much as it caused him to doubt the commission's 
ability to handle shifting circumstances. 
"The commission's attitude was that we couldn't go wrong, that competition 
would always be better than the old-fashioned regulatory market and 
essentially that any old market structure would work," he said. "That is 
simply not true." 
Then came California. 
"I just feel like our actions have been too little, too late all along," he 
said. "As billions of dollars are changing hands, we were studying it. Then 
we are investigating it," he said. 
"But for me, competitive markets have to produce just and reasonable prices. 
A dysfunctional market that produces outrageous prices is unlawful. And I 
think my agency has not taken strong enough steps to save California and the 
West from a wildly dysfunctional electricity market." 
Massey was on the commission when it basically rubber-stamped the California 
deregulation plan, the first in the nation. He said it arrived as a package, 
much of it written into state law, and that the agency did not ask hard 
questions such as how California could get the best price for consumers by 
relying on day-ahead power purchases on the volatile spot market. 
"Essentially we deferred to the market design that was handed to us," Massey 
said. "We did say that it was a work in progress, and that we would be paying 
attention to it. 
But to assume the spot markets would usually produce the lowest prices now, 
in retrospect, seems naive. We are now very critical of that market design 
but we did approve it." 
Now the commission, with only three of its five seats filled, is led by the 
panel's only Republican, Curt Hebert, who is adamantly opposed to price 
controls. 
The panel's other Democrat, Linda Breathitt, is similarly disposed. 
"I am the lone voice crying in the wilderness," Massey said. 
But with the power crisis pushing up wholesale rates throughout the West, 
Massey said this is not the time to be clinging to ideology. 
"I do not think it is worth bringing down the economy of an entire region of 
the country just for the theoretical purity," he said.

California's Choices All Look Painful
By LAURA M. HOLSON
OS ANGELES, March 23 * California's energy crisis seems to get worse with 
each passing day.
This week, Californians were once again plunged into darkness as warm weather 
and a large number of shuttered power plants caused blackouts from Santa 
Monica to San Francisco. In offices in and around Sacramento, frenzied 
negotiators continue their months-long talks to design a settlement to keep 
the nearly bankrupt utilities afloat and creditors at bay.
And despite a dizzying 190 bills introduced in the Legislature to address the 
crisis, the bickering among politicians persists. Republican leaders have 
called for the ouster of state utility officials, and California's controller 
warned that the state's general fund was in danger of being frittered away 
unless decisive action was taken. 
Two months ago, Gov. Gray Davis promised a speedy end to the crisis. But all 
the solutions proposed so far seem as fragile and tenuous as the grid itself.
Now a growing chorus of economists, business leaders and policy experts are 
saying what most agree that Mr. Davis will not utter: the state cannot spend 
its way out of this crisis, and politicians are delaying an inevitable, 
albeit unpopular, end * raising retail electricity rates significantly. The 
desire to satisfy all parties is costly and has caused confusion and 
indecision.
"The solution to the policy problem is moving agonizingly slowly because 
there are several powerful political groups that can block any piece of 
legislation," said Laura D'Andrea Tyson, a former chief economic adviser in 
the Clinton White House who is now the dean of the Haas School of Business at 
the University of California at Berkeley. "California's politicians don't 
seem to have enough power or conviction * I think it's power * to get these 
groups to agree." 
Further, said Steve Fleishman, a Merrill Lynch utility analyst in New York: 
"The government officials keep trying to plug the holes in the dam when they 
spout up. But there are too many things that need to be paid within the 
current utility rate structure." 
In an interview today, Governor Davis reiterated what he has said for months: 
California's biggest problem is short supply * no major power plants have 
been built in 10 years * and he has invoked his emergency power to put more 
generation online quickly. He warned, too, that state negotiators were 
proceeding with caution to avoid the kind of mistakes the architects of 
deregulation made in the first place. "One of the reasons we are in trouble 
today was because there was a rush to judgment," he said. "We are not going 
to make that mistake again."
But for a brief moment recently, it looked as if the state had finally 
marshaled its forces and was well on its way to presenting Californians with 
a cohesive plan. The state treasurer's office hired bankers to help sell a 
$10 billion bond issue, the largest of its kind, that would help pay for 
power now and stabilize prices over time. 
State negotiators hoping to avoid a taxpayer bailout announced a preliminary 
agreement with Southern California Edison to buy its transmission lines for 
about $2.76 billion. And Governor Davis proudly told reporters that his team 
had negotiated a successful round of long-term power contracts that would 
help keep California's lights on. 
But almost every promising announcement has had a less-enticing twist. 
Intense negotiations with the privately-owned utilities drag on week after 
week. Southern California Edison has not finished a deal to sell its 
transmission lines, a necessity if it is to begin paying bills owed since 
November. "Progress has been made," said Bob Foster, Edison's chief 
negotiator. But he warned, "I don't want to sound overly optimistic."
Pacific Gas and Electric, for its part, has not announced anything, even in 
principle. John Nelson, a spokesman for the utility, did not return calls 
seeking comment. 
Regarding the long-term power contracts, a report released this week says 
that the state has received commitments for less than half the 6,000 
megawatts it hopes to secure for this summer. The power generators, too, can 
opt out of their contracts for a variety of reasons, including a failure by 
the state to sell bonds by July 1. Governor Davis said today that in most 
cases, much of the energy the state wanted to buy for this summer was no 
longer available. That shortfall could require the state to buy more than 15 
percent of the energy it needs in the expensive spot market, nearly triple 
the amount he once said he wanted. 
Still, the issue that has caused the biggest controversy is who has first 
rights to the money now being collected from ratepayers. (Pacific Gas and 
Electric and Southern California Edison now have $4.4 billion in their 
coffers.) State officials have said that according to the law drafted in 
January to ensure the state could buy power on behalf of the utilities, the 
Department of Water Resources should be paid first. The utilities are saying 
they are first in line. Whatever the outcome, the law's ambiguity has been a 
problem for the state treasurer, Philip Angelides, who said it has not only 
cost him precious time, but could put the bond offering in jeopardy unless it 
is clear how the revenues will be divided. 
"The danger of this is if you let problems like this multiply, the situation 
gets worse and worse," he said. California's Public Utilities Commission is 
expected to rule on this issue. (Governor Davis said he expected the 
commission to agree that the state should be paid first.) 
But Mr. Angelides did not want to wait that long. Instead, he said, he and 
his team approached legislators to write another law so he could proceed with 
the state's $10 billion bond offering in May. 
But even then, he contends, the bond offering is only a short-term fix at 
best. "After the $10 billion is exhausted, we can't keep borrowing and 
borrowing and borrowing," Mr. Angelides said. "The reality is our lack of 
investment in power plants and inability to conserve are going to cost us 
more." 
Mr. Angelides has a point. But the governor's resistance to raising rates is 
at best a negotiating tool. The governor has told some people that he is open 
to raising rates, but only after the utilities make the concessions he wants, 
people close to the negotiations with the utilities said. It is part of his 
overall strategy, these people said * one that includes building more power 
plants and conserving energy, both crucial in helping California minimize 
disasters this year and next.
But that does little to solve the problem of the $13 billion in debts the 
utilities have already incurred. And that provides little comfort to the 
likes of Hal Dittmer, president and owner of the Wellhead Electric Company, a 
small power generation company in Sacramento, who decided to close down his 
three power plants in February because he had not been paid all the money 
owed by Pacific Gas and Electric. No solution now being discussed, he said, 
either in the legislature or with the utilities themselves, really addresses 
his problem. And like many of the utilities' creditors, he is growing 
impatient.
"The word I would use for what is going on in Sacramento is dithering," said 
Jack Kyser, chief economist of the Los Angeles County Economic Development 
Corporation, who has seen a swarm of recruiters from other states approach 
Los Angeles businesses recently in an effort to woo them away. "I think what 
they have to understand is that they are putting California's economic future 
at risk." 
Governor Davis, while sympathetic to his critics' frustrations, dismisses 
them. "They are viewing the process from afar," he said. "From the 
government's perspective, we are moving at warp speed."
But that may not be fast enough. Today, in Sacramento, the State Assembly 
rejected a plan that would have allowed smaller power generators, which have 
contracts directly with the utilities, to be paid. Unlike their larger 
counterparts, companies like Mr. Dittmer's do not have their sales guaranteed 
by the state and are themselves threatened by bankruptcy.
The utilities have been negotiating with the smaller generators for months, 
but industry analysts say the two groups are bitter rivals and no agreement 
is likely soon. And to make matters even more precarious, smaller generators 
could be the likeliest to force the utilities into involuntary bankruptcy, in 
part, because they want their money and have the least to lose.
"Politics is not just about keeping the lights on," Ms. Tyson said. "It's 
about making sure that all parties are represented." And that is contrary to 
the business world, she added, "where it's about getting the job done."

Local generators win small victory
Filed: 03/24/2001 
By VIC POLLARD, Californian Sacramento Bureau e-mail: 
vpollard@bakersfield.com 
SACRAMENTO -- With help from Kern County's three Assembly members, owners of 
small natural gas-fired generating plants like those in Kern's oil fields won 
a partial victory Friday in their campaign to get paid for the electricity 
they sell to nearly bankrupt utilities. 
Kern County lawmakers helped bury a bill that would have required the big 
utilities to start paying the small generators -- but at a price below what 
it costs them plants to operate. 
The legislation is expected to be taken up in revised form Monday, and Kern's 
lawmakers said they hope it will contain a better deal for the small 
generators. 
The action came at the end of a week of feverish activity sparked by rolling 
blackouts that hit unexpectedly Monday and Tuesday. The blackouts were caused 
partly by the shutdown of many small generating facilities because they have 
not been paid for their electricity in months. 
The crucial vote came late Thursday, when the Assembly's Republicans 
unanimously opposed the low-price payment bill, depriving it of the 
two-thirds vote needed for passage, in the face of heavy pressure from 
Democratic legislative leaders. They wanted to push the bill through 
Thursday, partly because most lawmakers were scheduled to leave Friday on an 
annual lobbying trip to Washington, D.C. 
No one felt the pressure more than Dean Florez of Shafter, the only Democrat 
to vote against the measure. 
"It was really tough," Florez said Friday. 
Assemblymen Roy Ashburn of Bakersfield and Phil Wyman of Tehachapi were among 
the Republicans voting against the measure. 
Florez and Ashburn said the main reason they voted no was that the bill would 
have locked in a price for the small generating facilities that would have 
made it impossible for the natural-gas fired plants, and many others, to keep 
operating. 
"If they're losing money generating electricity, they're going to close 
down," Ashburn said, adding to the state's shortage of electricity. 
On Friday, after hours of closed-door meetings between Democratic and 
Republican leaders and officials of Gov. Gray Davis' administration, Assembly 
Speaker Robert Hertzberg announced that negotiations would continue and the 
issue would come up again Monday. 
The problem for local lawmakers was that the price established by the 
governor's office, 7.9 cents per kilowatt hour for a five-year contract, is 
anywhere from one-half to one-third of what it costs the gas-fired generators 
to produce electricity because of the current high price of natural gas. 
Under current law, the gas-fired generators are assured of a price for their 
electricity that takes into account fluctuations in the price of natural gas. 
Florez said the price being considered by the PUC would have made it 
economical only for wind- and solar-powered generators.

Enron drops power project 
The move surprises critics and supporters of a Lake Elsinore hydroelectric 
plant. 
By Thomas Buckley
The Press-Enterprise
LAKE ELSINORE
Enron North America has pulled the plug on its plans for a hydroelectric 
power plant in Lake Elsinore. 
Friday's surprise move does not kill the proposal but dims the hopes of 
supporters like the Elsinore Valley Municipal Water District for the $450 
million project. 
But opponents, worried about power lines and the potential adverse effect on 
the environment, were overjoyed. 
"That's fantastic," said Barbara Bowers, La Cresta resident and member of a 
recently-empaneled project oversight citizen's committee. "(Enron officials) 
have finally discovered what we knew all along: This was not a viable 
project." 
While speculation about why Enron backed away from the proposal centered on 
the instability of both the lake and state-power market, company officials 
said their decision was a matter of timing. 
Enron spokeswoman Kathy Russeth said the timetable for both the hydro plant 
and the 23 miles of power lines that would have been strung along the 
Elsinore Mountains ridgeline was moving much slower than expected, prompting 
the company to re-allocate its resources to other projects in the state. 
"We need to pick up the pace with our power-plant development," Russeth said. 
While the water district still holds a three-year preliminary federal permit 
for a hydroelectric project and consultant Nevada Hydro has an agreement with 
the water district, observers say chances are Enron's departure makes the 
project impossible. 
Nevada Hydro is expected to continue work on the project, Enron said, but no 
one close to the project believes the water district and consulting firm can 
pull it off alone. Attempts to contact Nevada Hydro officials were 
unsuccessful. 
"If a company like Enron is not going ahead with this, it is unlikely the 
project will ever be built," said county Supervisor Bob Buster. 
But not everyone is willing to throw in the towel on the idea that has been 
in play for a decade, has been declared dead before. 
Dropping the project entirely is "not an option," said water district board 
President Kris Anderson. 
"We've got the permit and we've got three years to get the license to build," 
Anderson said. "I would hate to see the district get out now." 
Distict officials will met next week to decide how to proceed. 
Wildomar Chamber of Commerce President and citizen's committee member John 
Purpura agreed. 
"It's a sad case and I hope EVMWD can find another company to step into 
Enron's shoes," Purpura said. 
In its latest incarnation, the pumped-storage proposal was born last summer 
when Enron first showed an interest. 
The water district was poised to cut its ties to Nevada Hydro, a consulting 
firm long associated with trying to build project, when Enron said it might 
be interested in pursuing the proposal. 
In the following months, Enron, a multi-billion multi-national energy firm, 
spent thousands on research and securing the preliminary federal permit for 
the district. 
People who lived near the lake where the power plant would go were irked by 
what they saw as corporate heavy-handedness, while environmentalists and 
forest residents became alarmed by power line and reservoir construction 
plans. 
The federal permit to pursue a final building license was secured in February 
and the county-backed citizen's committee, after much controversy, had its 
first meeting five days ago. 
Backers have said the project would be a godsend to the lake, providing money 
to buy water to keep it full and to help fund the upcoming $15 million lake 
clean-up. Neither is likely to happen now, observers say. 
"All the expectations they raised have been dashed," said Buster, who sits on 
the joint-powers agency in charge of the lake clean-up project. "They owe the 
community an explanation." 
Environmentalist activist Gene Frick, who has fought the project for five 
years and once promised to chain himself to an oak tree, was gleeful at 
Enron's decision. 
"I thank you," Frick said, "my associates thank you, and the oak trees thank 
you."

Jobs at utilities appear safe -- for now 
PUC ruling offers some security at Edison and PG&E, but the threat of 
bankruptcy hovers over many. 
March 24, 2001 
By CATRINE JOHANSSON
The Orange County Register 
Safe for now, but for how long? 
That's the question for thousands of employees at Southern California Edison 
and Pacific Gas & Electric, which are near bankruptcy after paying billions 
more for power over the past 10 months than they could charge customers. 
The utilities hoped to save about $650 million by laying off some 3,000 
employees, but a ruling last week by the state Public Utilities Commission 
halted most of those plans. 
Edison had planned to cut about 2,000 jobs during the course of a year. About 
400 of them were cut in December, while the remaining 1,600 were to be cut 
during 2001. 
Shaun Rolow, a part-time Edison meter reader in Kern County, said he and his 
co-workers feel their jobs are fairly safe, thanks to the PUC ruling, but 
they worry about the future. 
"Most guys are very relieved, but we also talk a lot about the danger of 
Edison going bankrupt," he said. "We feel uneasy, but also try to joke about 
it. Like when we get our paychecks, we joke about whether they'll be any 
good." 
The 400 employees let go in December were contract workers whose contracts 
were up anyway, said Edison spokesman Steve Hansen. The PUC ruling does not 
reinstate any of those workers. It does, however, prohibit further layoffs in 
customer call centers, meter-reading departments, outage-response teams and 
new-customer connection departments. 
Exactly how many of the 1,600 other jobs are protected by the PUC ruling - 
and how many are not - is unclear, as Edison officials haven't completed 
their analysis of the ruling, Hansen said. 
Of the 1,600, "less than 50" were laid off before last week's PUC ruling. 
Whether any of those jobs will be reinstated remains to be decided. 
Steven Carlton, a 20-year Edison employee who is an electricity foreman in 
the Los Alamitos area, said a possible bankruptcy filing for the company is a 
more immediate worry than layoffs. 
"We know that there are too few people to do what we do as it is, so we 
wouldn't get laid off, but we do wonder what's going to happen in the future 
if the company goes bankrupt," Carlton said. 
The PUC also rejected the utilities' plans to cut expenses by reading 
electricity meters every other month and using estimated bills for the 
interim months. 
Bimonthly meter readings would, according to the PUC ruling, "create 
inaccuracies in calculating baseline usage, and consumers will not be able to 
see the results of their conservation efforts." 
Although the PUC allowed the utilities to continue reducing overtime, Edison 
has decided to pay for overtime work in some cases. 
"We continue to restrict overtime, except in cases where the public or 
employee safety are compromised," Hansen said. He would not elaborate on what 
kinds of situations those would be, but acknowledged that the company had 
changed a strict no-overtime policy that left residents of an apartment 
complex in Fountain Valley without electricity for a weekend in January. 
"If a community loses power, we'll send out people to fix it - even if it is 
on the weekend," Hansen said. 
The utilities can petition the PUC to change the ruling on layoffs, but 
there's no word yet on whether they will do so. 
"We don't know yet, but we do expect the utilities to appeal," said Pat 
Lavin, business manager for Local 47 of the International Brotherhood of 
Electrical Workers, which represents 4,100 Edison workers. 
The IBEW is one of the unions in the Coalition of California Utility 
Employees, which filed the grievance with the PUC that prompted the ruling. 
Lavin said the unions watch the situation closely and are prepared to 
challenge future layoff plans by the utilities - regardless of whether the 
targeted employees are union members.

State power regulator proposes 40% rate increase 
Posted at 12:00 noon PST Monday, March 26, 2001 
BY KAREN GAUDETTE 

Associated Press Writer 

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- California's top power regulator proposed a 40 percent 
hike in electricity rates Monday, saying such an increase should encourage 
customers to cut back on usage and conserve enough power to get through the 
hot summer months. 
Loretta Lynch, president of the Public Utilities Commission, said rates 
should increase by an average of 3 cents per kilowatt hour. The current rate 
averages 7.5 cents per kilowatt hour. 
The higher rates could go into effect as early as Tuesday, when the PUC 
meets. Lynch and two other members of the five-member PUC were appointed by 
Gov. Gray Davis, and Lynch's proposal is expected to be approved by the 
commission. 
Lynch, who repeatedly refused to characterize the hike as a 40 percent 
increase, said the increase was needed to avoid significant power problems 
this summer. 
``That number should be all that is needed going forward,'' she said at a 
news conference, ``to keep utilities solvent and ensure that the treasurer of 
the state can issue bonds.'' 
Lynch's proposal is at odds with that of administrative law judge Christine 
Walwyn, who recently advised the PUC that rate increases were not necessary. 
Any increase would be on top of the 9 percent to 15 percent rate increase the 
PUC approved in January, and an additional 10 percent increase already 
scheduled for next year. 
Lynch also supports a ``tiered'' rate system that would charge residential 
and businesses customers more if they're large users and fail to cut back. So 
it should encourage conservation. 
The governor repeatedly has said he is confident the state's power crisis can 
be resolved without further rate hikes. But Davis aides have concluded that 
rates must rise, given that wholesale power costs remain high. Several 
lawmakers, including Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg, have said a rate 
increase is inevitable. 
Southern California Edison Co. and Pacific Gas & Electric Co. both have 
pushed for further rate increases, and PG&E has said its current rates would 
be insufficient to cover its bills and the state's. 
Administration officials have been negotiating with PG&E, Edison and San 
Diego Gas & Electric about purchasing the utilities' transmission lines to 
give the companies cash to pay their bills. 
PG&E and Edison say they've lost more than $13 billion since last summer due 
to high wholesale electricity costs that California's 1996 deregulation law 
prevents them from collecting from their customers.

Calif State Treasurer: Electricity Rate Hike Inevitable

03/26/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The State of California will have to raise electricity 
rates for consumers to reflect the dramatic price rise seen in the wholesale 
power market, State Treasurer Phil Angelides said Monday in an interview on 
CNBC. 
Angelides declined to specify how much rates would rise from current levels, 
however, and he said that the state's two main investor-owned utilities might 
possibly have to reorganize their financial situation through a bankruptcy 
proceeding.
"It's hard to tell," what the percentage of the increase would be, Angelides 
said, "but there's no mystery that rates are going up. We have to match the 
price of power to what we pay for it to keep the lights on." 
The rate increase would both curb demand and assure lenders that the state 
will be able to repay the $10 billion in bonds it wants to issue to cover the 
costs of purchasing power. 
As for the utilities, "It's their job to reorganize themselves inside or 
outside of a bankruptcy proceeding," Angelides said, adding that the 
utilities' parent companies greatly benefitted from electric deregulation for 
three years before suffering huge losses in 2000. 
Since the state began buying power on behalf of its two near-bankrupt 
utilities - PG&E Corp.'s (PCG) Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Edison 
International's (EIX) Southern California Edison - in January, it has spent 
almost $3 billion covering the difference between the utilities' generated 
power and their customers' electricity usage. 
Angelides spoke from New York, where he is trying to convince Wall Street 
bankers to help issue the $10 billion in bonds. The debt issue will provide 
"breathing room to get to a long-term plan by September to balance market 
prices and rates," he said. The money will also be used for "a very dramatic 
conservation program." 
"If we can get demand down 5% to 10%, we can get power prices down," 
Angelides said. 
But the treasurer also said that the merchant power companies in the state 
have acted unconscionably. Reducing demand, he said, will put the state in a 
better position to get the producers to negotiate reasonable long-term prices 
as part of a sustainable solution to the state's power and financial crisis. 
"The first problem is a supply and demand imbalance. If we in California deny 
that we're denying reality. But the other problem is that generators have 
been charging unfair and unreasonably prices," said Angelides, who said 
generators have to "take their foot off our throat and meet us half-way."

Possible rate hikes cheer California utility investors 
MICHAEL LIEDTKE, AP Business Writer
Monday, March 26, 2001 
,2001 Associated Press 
(03-26) 11:46 PST SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The prospect of substantially higher 
electricity rates in California drew rave reviews Monday on Wall Street as 
investors snapped up the long-suffering stocks of the state's two largest 
utilities. 
With about two hours of trading left on the New York Stock Exchange, shares 
in PG&E Corp. surged $3.80, or 36 percent, to $14.45 while Edison 
International's stock gained $3.79, or 34 percent, to $14.99. 
San Francisco-based PG&E and Rosemead-based Edison International own 
utilities that have been flirting with bankruptcy for months as they paid for 
soaring wholesale electricity costs that couldn't be passed on to customers 
under the state's deregulation law. 
After months of resistance to the idea, state political leaders and 
regulators are poised to swallow a bitter pill and prescribe significant new 
rate increases. 
California's top power regulator proposed a 40 percent hike in electricity 
rates Monday, saying such an increase should encourage customers to cut back 
on usage and conserve enough power to get through the hot summer months. 
Loretta Lynch, president of the Public Utilities Commission, said rates 
should increase by an average of 3 cents per kilowatt hour. The current rate 
averages 7.5 cents per kilowatt hour. The higher rates could go into effect 
as early as Tuesday, when the PUC meets. 
Gov. Gray Davis remains confident the state's power crisis can be resolved 
without further rate hikes, an aide said Monday. But his high-level financial 
aides warned legislative leaders Friday that consumers could feel significant 
pain when all is said and done. 
Although nothing has been completed, news of the likely rate increases leaked 
out during the weekend and raised hopes on Wall Street that the darkest days 
for the two utilities, Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California 
Edison, might be behind them. 
The utilities' executives, backed by numerous industry analysts, have 
contended for months that the state needed to approve hefty rate increases to 
ease a power crisis that threatens to make rolling blackouts a routine event 
this summer. 
The higher rates are seen as a way to ease the financial burden of the 
utilities, which say they have run up debts of more than $13 billion buying 
wholesale electricity during the last 10 months. Analysts also reason higher 
electricity bills will persuade more customers to reduce their usage and 
reduce the frequency of blackouts this summer. 
The likely rate increases weren't the only good news for utility shareholders 
Monday. 
Over the weekend, Southern California Edison said it will resume payments to 
alternative energy providers known as ``qualifying facilities'' -- a move 
expected to reduce the chances that the disgruntled generators will band 
together and try to force the utility into bankruptcy. 
In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing Monday, Pacific Gas and 
Electric disclosed that it had received more breathing room from some of its 
key creditors. The utility has defaulted on a $1 billion revolving credit 
line, but the banks that made the loans have given the company until April 13 
to work things out, the filing said. 
PG&E also revealed that its electricity losses could result in a $4.1 billion 
charge against its fourth-quarter earnings.

Duke says would take less for California power sales 
Posted at 11:55 a.m. PST Monday, March 26, 2001 
NEW YORK, (Reuters) - Duke Energy Corp. said Monday it would take less money 
for power it sold to California customers during January and February, 
provided it receives guarantees it will get paid. 
Responding to accusations by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) 
that it overcharged its California customers by $17.8 million during power 
shortages in January and February, Duke said in a statement that the prices 
it charged were ''reasonable'' given the high risks that generators would not 
be paid. 
In a filing with FERC Friday, Duke President and Chief Executive Officer Jim 
Donnell said, ``We could be willing to forgo collection of the credit 
premiums for these months, provided we receive the FERC clearing price.'' 
California's Independent System Operator, which covers 75 percent of the 
state's power grid, has accused generators of overcharging customers by $6.2 
billion since May. 
Houston-based Duke said that during the months of January and February its 
bids included a credit premium to cover the ''substantial risk'' of 
nonpayment. Duke said the credit premium and market condition were 
responsible for its bids exceeding the FERC determined market clearing price. 
FERC had set a $273 megawatt per hour cap on power sales to California during 
the Stage 3 emergencies in January and February. 
Shares of Duke were up $1.27, or more than 3 percent, to $39.15 in afternoon 
trading on the New York Stock Exchange, compared to a 52-week high of 
$45.2188 and low of $24.8750.

Power Woes Raise Questions Over Control of Gas Pipelines
By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. and LOWELL BERGMAN
arly last year, the El Paso Natural Gas Company took bids from two dozen 
companies for the right to ship enough natural gas through its pipeline from 
Texas and New Mexico to meet one-sixth of the daily demand of energy-starved 
California. 
The winner: El Paso's sister company, the El Paso Merchant Energy Company, 
which buys, sells and trades natural gas. The bidding was not close. El Paso 
Merchant offered twice as much for the capacity as the other companies bid, 
in total, for bits and pieces.
Why pay so much more? California officials, who are pressing a complaint 
against El Paso at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, say the answer 
is simple. The state contends that El Paso Merchant, with help from its 
sister company, saw the transaction as a way to manipulate the price of 
natural gas by using its control of pipeline capacity. 
According to sealed documents obtained by The New York Times that are part of 
filings in the federal case, executives at El Paso Merchant said internally 
that the deal would give them "more control" of gas markets, including the 
"ability to influence the physical market" to benefit the company's financial 
positions.
El Paso executives called the accusations fanciful, and in a formal response 
to California's complaint, said the state "grossly distorted" company 
documents by quoting words and phrases out of context.
The dispute opens a window on an important debate about oversight of the 
natural gas industry, which fuels a growing share of the nation's electric 
power plants.
At issue is whether current safeguards do enough to prevent anticompetitive 
abuses in the marketing and trading of natural gas, and whether federal 
regulators adequately enforce existing rules. In particular, many industry 
officials question whether regulated pipeline companies are able to favor 
unregulated sister companies that trade natural gas and are free to maximize 
profits.
More than 200,000 miles of interstate pipelines crisscross the country, 
moving natural gas from Canada, the Southwest and other producing regions to 
fuel factories, power utilities and heat houses. 
Not long ago, many parts of the country had excess pipeline capacity. But 
experts say that several regions, including California, New York and New 
England, now face constraints as demand soars for gas to fuel power plants. 
In California, state officials and utility executives said the documents in 
the federal case, and El Paso's actions, were proof that the state's energy 
crisis stemmed not just from an ill-conceived deregulation plan but from 
price manipulation and profiteering.
"They are the market maker with this pipeline," said Loretta Lynch, the 
president of the California Public Utilities Commission, which has struggled 
to cope with skyrocketing power prices and supply shortages. 
El Paso "sets the price in California," Ms. Lynch said, and what it did was 
intentional. "It has affected the price," she said, "for everything related 
to heat and electrical power prices in the state." 
California's complaint to the federal agency contends that El Paso Merchant 
"has hoarded capacity and refused to attractively price unused capacity" on 
the pipeline. The state also charges that El Paso Natural Gas, the pipeline's 
owner, has had no incentive to spur competition, by offering discounts to 
other users, because the two companies are corporate siblings. The state said 
that El Paso had violated federal natural gas statutes that prohibit 
anticompetitive behavior.
The sealed filings in the El Paso case indicated that the company expected to 
make money by widening the "basis spread" * the difference between what gas 
can be bought for in producing basins of Texas and New Mexico, at one end of 
the pipeline, and its price on delivery to Southern California.
As it turned out, spreads widened enormously over the last year as the price 
of gas soared in California, adding to costs for wholesale electricity that 
pushed the biggest utilities near bankruptcy. California utilities paid $6.2 
billion above competitive prices for wholesale electricity over the last 10 
months, state officials estimated. The utilities are not allowed to recoup 
the costs from customers. While the cost of 1,000 cubic feet of gas typically 
is less than $1 higher at the California end of the pipeline, spot prices in 
the state rose to almost $50 more than the Texas- New Mexico price in 
December.
To executives of the parent company, the El Paso Corporation, the accusations 
of market manipulation are ludicrous. 
High gas prices in California, El Paso executives said in interviews, are 
easily explained by soaring demand, the poor credit standing of the state's 
utilities and the failure of the utilities to retain pipeline capacity or 
store enough gas for winter.
"The idea that anybody is holding back on California is really ridiculous," 
said Clark C. Smith, president of El Paso Merchant's operations in North 
America. 
Some El Paso customers, though, agreed with California officials. The Pacific 
Gas & Electric Company, the San Francisco-based utility, condemned El Paso in 
a filing with the federal agency after its lawyers reviewed the sealed 
company documents. 
"It is now very clear from the business records of El Paso Energy 
Corporation," the utility said in the filing, "that the business strategy El 
Paso Merchant was authorized at the highest corporate levels to pursue 
involved manipulation of price spreads." 
The agency has not ruled on California's complaint, which asks that the deal 
between El Paso Natural Gas and El Paso Merchant be invalidated. Based on the 
agency's history of policing energy providers lightly, many industry 
observers predicted that the complaint would be dismissed, perhaps as soon as 
the agency's public meeting on Wednesday.
Nonetheless, El Paso Merchant is feeling some pressure. The subsidiary said 
recently that it planned to relinquish control of all but about 22 percent of 
the capacity on the pipeline to California, rather than exercise an option 
that would have allowed it to retain the entire capacity of 1.2 billion cubic 
feet of gas a day. 
Critics said they believed El Paso made the move in hopes of lessening the 
chance of government action. El Paso executives deny that but do say that 
their decision was influenced by the backlash over the arrangement.
Surrendering the pipeline capacity made for a "gut-wrenching" decision, Mr. 
Smith said, but was "a first- class gesture" to California. El Paso Merchant 
paid $38.5 million to control the pipeline capacity from March 1, 2000, until 
May 31, 2001. While Mr. Clark said he did not know the return on that 
investment, he acknowledged that it was lucrative.
"No doubt about it," Mr. Clark said, "we made good money." 
The question of whether El Paso's conduct has driven gas prices higher is 
expected to be scrutinized by legislators in Sacramento this week. The 
company also faces several lawsuits, including one by the city of Los 
Angeles, that accuse it of conspiring with other companies to prevent 
pipeline projects that could have eased California's energy crisis. El Paso 
denied the accusation.
With pipeline capacity and gas supplies tighter, concerns about 
anticompetitive behavior have increased as price volatility has created 
soaring profits for energy marketers and traders. 
Dynegy Inc., a Houston-based energy trader, was once the target of complaints 
to federal regulators that it had artificially raised prices by abusing 
capacity that it controlled on El Paso's pipeline to California.
In a filing with regulators in January, Dynegy contended that pipeline 
companies routinely favored affiliates. "Abuses abound because of financial 
windfalls, difficulty of detection, lengthy investigations and increased 
complexity of the market," the company said.
"There are some red flags right now," said William L. Massey, a member of the 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission since 1993. Mr. Massey said he was 
troubled by the potential for abuses when pipeline companies own gas and 
power marketing subsidiaries as well as electric plants fueled by natural 
gas. El Paso is in all those businesses.
"What the commission ought to be serious about is: What are the forces at 
work? Is it simply robust markets responding to true supply-and-demand 
signals, or is it a market defined by market power and some measure of 
affiliate abuse?" he said. 
Many in the industry do not believe changes are needed. 
"There are rules in place today that protect against affiliate abuse," said 
Stanley Horton, chief executive for gas pipeline operations at the Enron 
Corporation and chairman of the Interstate Natural Gas Association of 
America, the industry's trade group, referring to the rules under which 
California has brought its complaint about El Paso.
To its critics, El Paso epitomizes competitive concerns. It operates the 
nation's largest network of interstate pipelines and owns one of the largest 
reserves of natural gas. With its recent acquisition of the Coastal 
Corporation, another large pipeline operator, El Paso has a market 
capitalization of $32 billion. 
At a conference at El Paso headquarters in Houston in February, analysts 
heard executives predict net profits of $1.7 billion this year. El Paso's 
much better known rival, Enron, with its headquarters a few blocks away, is 
expected to earn about $1.4 billion.
El Paso Merchant provides the strongest growth. Two years ago, the unit's 
profits, before interest payments and taxes, were $99 million; this year, it 
is expected to have $700 million in North America alone. In its latest 
quarterly report, El Paso attributed those profits, in part, to "commodity 
market and trading margins" that were enhanced by "power price volatility, 
particularly in the Western United States." 
Critics contend that El Paso set out to exploit those conditions. According 
to the sealed filings, on Feb. 14, 2000, the day before El Paso Merchant was 
awarded the pipeline capacity, executives made a presentation to William A. 
Wise, chief executive of the parent company, laying out the rationale for the 
bid. 
The presentation outlined what it termed "strategic advantages," including 
"more control of total physical markets" and the "ability to influence the 
physical market to the benefit of any financial/hedge position," according to 
the sealed filings. The passages suggested that El Paso expected the deal to 
give it sway over the market for trading actual volumes of gas and to support 
financial transactions it had entered into with other parties to limit its 
risk.
For every one-cent increase in the spread on gas prices, the presentation 
said, El Paso Merchant stood to make an additional $2.4 million. 
Under the heading "Challenges," according to the sealed filings, the 
presentation stated that storage was needed "to help manipulate physical 
spreads, adding to the overall transport/storage cost."
On April 14, according to the sealed filings, El Paso Merchant's president at 
the time, Greg G. Jenkins, wrote a memorandum to Mr. Wise involving an update 
for directors meeting later that month. The memorandum stated: "We will make 
money two ways: 1) increase the load factor, 2) widen the basis spread." 
The language appears to suggest that El Paso Merchant would profit by 
increasing the gas flow in the pipeline * the load factor * while increasing 
the difference between what gas could be bought for at one end and what it 
could be sold for at the other end * the basis spread.
In an interview, Mr. Smith, the El Paso Merchant executive, said that the 
unit's prices, and profits, on bulk gas sales in California were locked in 
months in advance, so that the company could not benefit from rising prices 
in the spot market. 
Otherwise, Mr. Smith declined to provide any details about money made on the 
pipeline deal or about financial terms of the transactions that locked in 
prices ahead of time. In addition, Mr. Smith said that nearly all of El Paso 
Merchant's pipeline capacity was used every day when prices spiked late last 
year, with no capacity withheld to increase prices.
The company did not respond last week to a request to discuss information in 
the sealed documents. But El Paso Merchant, in a filing with federal 
regulators, said California's complaint had "misconstrued and incorrectly 
interpreted" what it termed "snippets of data."

SoCal Edison To Pay QFs On Going-Forward Basis

03/25/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

ROSEMEAD, Calif. -(Dow Jones)- Edison International's (EIX) Southern 
California Edison unit said that, in anticipation of pending action by the 
California Public Utilities Commission to restructure the way qualifying 
facility generators, or QFs, will be paid, the utility will resume payments 
to QFs on a going-forward basis. 
In a press release Sunday, Southern California Edison said it has set aside 
funds in a separate account and will make payments in advance of expected 
April deliveries.
Payment processing would begin immediately after the CPUC approves on Tuesday 
a proposed decision to restructure QF prices. 
Advance payments will be based on the generators' historical production level 
and the PUC's pricing order. 
The company said it will be able to make payments only up to "an aggregate 
amount that is available to us from rates actually received for QF payments." 

Southern California Edison said that "in recognition of the state's need for 
all the electricity it can get during these times, SCE is hereby instituting 
a program to pay those QFs that continue to provide electricity to the 
utility." 
The company is "leaving it up to the discretion of the" PUC "as to how the 
payment structure will be revamped and how we should allocate the payments to 
QFs." 
The PUC will likely approve a 20% rate increase for Southern California 
Edison and PG&E Corp.'s (PCG) Pacific Gas & Electric on Tuesday, ending a 
three-year-old retail rate freeze, two PUC commissioners told Dow Jones 
Newswires on Saturday. 
The increase also would let utilities start paying small independent power 
producers on a forward basis for electricity sold directly to the utilities, 
the commissioners said. 
PG&E and SoCal Ed are now more than $13 billion in debt, have seen their 
ratings downgraded to junk status by Wall Street credit agencies and have 
defaulted on billions of dollars in dividend payments, power bills and bank 
loans.

Legislative firebrand Burton plays hardball in debate over power 
Posted at 9:53 p.m. PST Sunday, March 25, 2001 
BY HALLYE JORDAN 

Mercury News Sacramento Bureau 


SACRAMENTO -- It didn't take long for perpetually impatient John Burton to 
size up the conference call as a waste of time. 
Twenty minutes and four curses into the conversation, the president pro tem 
of the state Senate announced to the utility company executives, outgoing 
Clinton Cabinet members and top state officials that he was putting down the 
phone -- to shave. 
Five minutes later, he stashed his Gillette Mach 3 and returned to the phone. 
As he suspected, ``I didn't miss a thing.'' 
Welcome to the world of John Lowell Burton, perhaps the state's most 
powerful, colorful and combative legislator. That Burton has ascended to the 
top rung of political power in California surprises many, and perhaps no one 
more than Burton himself. 
The 68-year-old product of old school San Francisco politics has a penchant 
for profanity and a demeanor that ricochets from volatile to gruff to goofy. 
He fought a well-publicized battle against cocaine addiction that threatened 
to end not only his political career but his life. Burton not only survived, 
he thrived -- a die-hard liberal somehow succeeding in an age of centrism. 
He has prevailed in part by balancing the two sides of his political persona: 
the idealistic progressive and the pragmatic deal-maker. 
Idealistic though he may be, Burton has a healthy appetite for hard-ball 
politics. He's been known to abandon longtime supporters in favor of economic 
special interests when it was politically expedient. He has a knack for 
fundraising that makes political reformers blanch. And he delights in 
jousting with the state's moderate Democratic governor, Gray Davis. 
In his fourth year as Senate president pro tem, the second most powerful post 
in Sacramento, Burton is up to his gold wire-rims and gray-flecked eyebrows 
in the debate over rolling blackouts and energy industry bailouts. 
The crisis has proved vexing for the veteran pol. Consumer groups are among 
his most ardent supporters. Yet Burton feels compelled to find a way to keep 
the lights on -- even though that means helping the cash-strapped utilities 
that consumer groups love to hate. 
It hasn't been easy. On Thursday, he showed his frustration with the 
utilities during a Senate debate: ``I hope they go bankrupt. Let them go 
belly up. I don't care anymore.'' 
Earlier in the session, Burton introduced a bill that would set up a state 
power authority to help finance construction of new power plants. Another 
bill he pushed would authorize the state to purchase electricity lines from 
its cash-strapped utilities for at least $7 billion. 
The subject of ongoing negotiations between the utilities and Davis, the 
transmission line deal is intended to give taxpayers a valuable asset while 
helping utility companies stay on their feet. ``If you go broke,'' Burton 
said, ``you sell your car or you hock your watch.'' 
Republicans see Burton's plan as yet another example of big government run 
amok. 
``He has that basic philosophy that says government wants to run 
everything,'' said Assemblyman Tony Strickland, R-Camarillo. 
Burton grew up on the outskirts of the Sunset district in San Francisco, the 
youngest of three boys. His mother was a no-nonsense woman who, when her 
husband refused to buy her a fur coat or a car, worked two jobs to purchase a 
mink and a used blue Buick convertible. 
His father was a doctor who practiced in poor neighborhoods and instilled in 
his sons a gnawing need to help those less fortunate. 
He is obviously his parents' child: The closets of his Potrero Hill home are 
stuffed with suede jackets and tailored slacks that he regularly rotates into 
the back seat of his car, where they are within easy reach in case he passes 
a homeless shelter or some suffering soul on the street who looks his size. 
``My whole thing is caring for people on the edge that nobody gives a 
(expletive deleted) about,'' Burton said. 
Subtle, he is not: During the height of the debate over welfare reform, he 
chided his peers for slashing welfare benefits by introducing a bill that 
would have made it a crime to be poor. 
Burton believes his party has sold out the disenfranchised in its quest to 
capture the moderate middle. 
``Who stands for anything anymore?'' he sputters with an expletive. ``What's 
wrong with making sure all kids have medical insurance?'' 
He seems to revel in his reputation as the only lawmaker willing to take on 
the state's centrist governor. Their clashes are frequent, and Davis' staff 
keeps a wary eye on Burton. 
Last year, Davis proposed a scholarship program to reward high-achieving 
students. Fearing the plan would siphon money from an existing program that 
provides scholarships for poor students, Burton and a bipartisan group of 
senators linked Davis' proposal to one expanding scholarships based on 
financial need. 
That meant both would become law if Davis signed either one. Burton said the 
bill was the brainchild of all, but it bore his name for one reason: ``I 
didn't want the governor to (expletive deleted) with it,'' he said. Davis 
didn't. 
Burton followed in the footsteps of his oldest brother, Phillip, a powerful, 
legendary congressman who died in 1983. 
John Burton spent 10 years in the Assembly and was elected to Congress in 
1974. He served eight years before cocaine addiction forced him out of 
politics and into a Scottsdale rehab clinic. 
At some point, Burton said, he just got sick of doing drugs in any of the 
dozens of anonymous Washington, D.C., hotel rooms he called home. 
``Finally,'' he said, ``it seemed to make a lot more sense to get some 
treatment than be dead, or have a breakdown, or be in jail.'' 
His drug days return only in occasional dreams in which the cocaine 
inevitably gets stuck in a straw or spills on the carpet. 
Today, Burton's lone addiction is caffeine -- he regularly downs at least 
four cappuccinos in the morning, insisting on extra-firm foam. And he may 
have three Diet Cokes, each with a slice of lemon, during dinner. 
For six years after his drug rehabilitation, Burton lived in San Francisco, 
staying straight, playing racquetball, sunning on the deck of his home with 
its sweeping vista of the downtown skyline. 
He indulged in movies and made good money as a corporate lawyer. He also 
played the stock market, accumulating wealth he pegs at $1.5 million, but 
that financial disclosure statements indicate ranges between $1.7 million and 
$7.2 million. 
From Gap Inc. to Wal-Mart, Burton's portfolio is impressive, if incongruous: 
This self-styled voice of the common man owns stocks in huge pharmaceutical, 
high-tech, communications and oil and gas companies. 
But his stock holdings are no more surprising than the fact that attorney 
Burton, the champion of consumer issues, was once on retainer for Pacific Gas 
& Electric Co. 
In 1988, politics came knocking again. Burton's old Assembly seat was open, 
and his pal, then Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, desperately needed allies to 
help squelch rebel Democrats who were challenging his control. 
``No (expletive deleted) way,'' Burton replied three times before finally 
relenting -- and winning. 
Eight years later, he was elected to the Senate. Two years after that, his 
colleagues chose him to serve in the state's highest legislative post, Senate 
president pro tem. 
While his personality and political instincts helped win him the spot, 
another asset propelled Burton to victory: His ability to raise boatloads of 
campaign cash. 
He turns even chance encounters into potentially profitable conversations. In 
early December, a friend who ran into Burton in a San Francisco restaurant 
mentioned that he'd dropped off a Christmas gift at Burton's office. The 
senator didn't skip a beat. ``Is it cash?'' he asked with a quick grin. 
Even people who detest Burton's politics tend to like the man. 
The Rev. Lou Sheldon of the Traditional Values Coalition said there isn't a 
legislator he disagrees with more on hot-button topics such as gay rights and 
abortion. Still, he can't help but enjoy sparring with Burton. 
No `stuffed shirt' 
``He's not a stuffed shirt,'' Sheldon said. ``He doesn't double-talk you.'' 
Twice divorced, Burton met his first wife in 1963 at a meeting in the home of 
Vince Hallinan, the famed San Francisco civil rights lawyer. She was the 
daughter of a labor leader who organized plantation workers and longshoremen 
in Hawaii. Married for seven years, they had one daughter, Kimiko Burton, the 
acting San Francisco public defender. He remarried in 1975, and divorced in 
1981. 
These days, as he makes his way through the Capitol, Burton often plays the 
gracious flirt, chatting up female lobbyists and colleagues. The next moment, 
he might be blowing up at someone, yelling four-letter words that echo down 
the high-ceilinged corridors and force staffers to keep his office doors shut 
so as not to offend touring school children. 
State Sen. Sheila Kuehl, D-Los Angeles, once joked that Cal-Tech had 
developed an ``FPM'' scale for the number of obscenities Burton spews per 
minute. ``More than 50 FPMs,'' she said, ``and John is really, really mad. 
Less than 10, check his breathing.'' 
Beneath the bluster is a shrewd politician who can grasp the high points of 
the most complex subjects, instruct his staff to figure out the details and 
seal the deal with his word. As one pundit put it, Burton is the guy who 
can't read a map, but never gets lost. 
Consider 1998, Burton's first year as Senate leader. Then-Gov. Pete Wilson 
and the Republicans wanted to slash the state's hefty vehicle license tax as 
a way to share California's $4.4 billion budget surplus. But Burton and the 
Democrats wanted to earmark the money for the needy who had taken cuts during 
the recession. 
Burton's staff devised a plan to phase in the tax cuts over several years, 
but only if the state was rolling in money. That protected revenues for the 
Democrats' pet projects, while giving Wilson bragging rights to a huge tax 
cut. 
`Safe' seat for a liberal 
Being a larger-than-life liberal in the nation's most liberal city provides a 
sense of security that few other politicians enjoy. Burton hasn't faced a 
serious political challenge since the 1960s, and occupying a ``safe'' seat 
allows him to carry controversial, special-interest bills -- even when they 
tick off his core supporters. 
Burton paid scant attention when environmentalists opposed his efforts to 
make it easier to fill in the San Francisco Bay for runway expansions at San 
Francisco International Airport. He shrugged off criticism about a bill he is 
carrying that would benefit a large campaign donor who owns an out-of-state 
gambling facility. And he alienated campaign finance reform advocates by 
pushing a campaign contribution and spending limits initiative that they said 
was too permissive. 
Consumer groups chafed at one of Burton's first legislative responses to the 
energy crisis: using $400 million of taxpayer money to buy electricity for 
the cash-strapped utilities. Still, they turn to Burton. 
``Every morning when I get up, for the last two months, I say a little prayer 
for John Burton,'' said consumer activist Harvey Rosenfield. ``If there is 
going to be one hero in this four-year deregulation debacle, it's going to be 
John Burton.'' 
Those who watched Burton pull back from the brink of self-destruction and 
stage his political comeback have seen him work magic before. They hope he 
has one trick left to solve the energy mess. Burton says the crisis is the 
most daunting political problem he has faced in his long career. 
``I don't think I have the power or the ability to put the toothpaste back in 
the tube,'' Burton said with a shrug. ``But we're working on it.''

Web of power intrigue alleged 
Many say generators shared data on the Internet to exploit the market. 
March 25, 2001 
By KIMBERLY KINDY
The Orange County Register 
Power producers selling electricity to California's fledgling deregulated 
market shared confidential data that allowed them to watch one another's 
every move - giving them leverage to drive up prices and helping to launch 
the state last spring into its energy crisis, records and interviews show. 
The information provided a picture of the state's electricity grid in motion: 
The amount of electricity being generated, price bids for electricity, the 
location of units down for repairs, schedules of electricity delivery over 
transmission lines, and the location of transmission bottlenecks. 
It was all done over the World Wide Web. 
Most of the Web sites have been shut down, amid allegations that the 
information was used to "game," or manipulate, the electric market and gouge 
Californians out of billions of dollars while bringing the state's largest 
utilities to the brink of bankruptcy and prompting rolling blackouts. 
At least one site remains, and negotiations to resurrect another 
controversial site are under way, frustrating consumer groups and antitrust 
lawyers who contend the power producers have found new means to collude, 
using state-of-the-art computer technology. 
"Openness and willingness to share information was turned against us and used 
to manipulate the market rather than to bolster the market," said consumer 
advocate Michael Shames of the Utility Consumers Action Network. 
"It's a lesson that is going to cost billions of dollars." 
The data sharing began as a way to ensure the smooth operation of the state's 
electrical grid, by giving timely information to all the people in the 
market: power producers, utilities, those operating the grid. 
In recent weeks, federal and state regulators have accused the power 
companies of charging too much and manipulating the market. 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ordered 13 power generators to 
justify their prices or pay nearly $70 million in refunds. 
It also accused two producers with Orange County operations of creating 
scarcity and gouging by as much as $10.8 million. 
Last week, the California Independent System Operator, which manages three- 
quarters of the state's electricity grid, filed a complaint with federal 
officials alleging that 21 power producers overcharged the state by $6.8 
billion since May 2000. 
Power producers have routinely called the investigations "witch hunts" and 
believe they will conclude with officials seeing that normal market 
conditions - not market manipulation - led to the high prices. They say the 
data from Web sites were used to help manage their work and design trading 
strategies -- all legally. 
"It's no different from putting together a weather forecast," said Randy 
Hickok, man aging director of California assets for Duke Energy Corp. 
"You use the information to determine your trading strategy." 
Live data feeds on output, transmission 
A review of a dozen studies and investigations into California's electricity 
market, coupled with interviews with more than 20 economists, antitrust 
experts, Web site designers, power merchants and utility officials reveals a 
key flaw in the market: It hinged on instant communications over the 
Internet. 
By the summer of 1999, three main Web sites were online and being used by the 
power producers. 
One was operated by the Western Systems Coordinating Council - which includes 
power merchants from 17 Western states and parts of Canada and Mexico. The 
council oversees the smooth flow of power around the West. This private site 
went offline in October 2000. It provided live data that showed the most 
detailed information available on generation and transmission of electricity. 
The site might be revived. The council has paid for a new software package to 
get direct feeds from power producers, and talks are under way. 
Another private, now-defunct Web site, which was run by the exchange that 
until January organized California's hourly energy auctions, provided live 
data showing energy up for auction, bidding prices, and when the bids were 
accepted. 
Still another site - The Open Access Same-Time Information System, or OASIS, 
provides data for the day- ahead market that shows how much capacity is 
available on transmission lines so generators can figure out what paths to 
use to deliver electricity. 
The OASIS site still provides data about bottlenecks that can affect prices. 
However, this has caused less concern because it can't be acted on 
immediately. It's only used for bids for the next day's market, and by then 
congestion could be cleared. The Web sites offered rows of numbers in charts 
and tables. The power traders downloaded the data into computer programs that 
spit out maps of the electricity grid that were updated every few seconds. 
Traders could view the maps as they bought and sold energy off the 
trading-room floors - expansive rooms loaded with computers, scrolling 
tickers and huge televisions tuned to the Weather Channel. 
The California Power Exchange, which held the energy auction, in April 1998 
identified five merchants that were dominating the market. They were Williams 
Cos., Dynegy Inc., Reliant Energy Inc., Sempra Energy and Duke. 
The question at the heart of a series of state and federal inquiries is 
whether the power producers conspired or colluded to fix prices at inflated 
rates, or whether market conditions prompted them to mirror one another's 
bidding strategies. 
Price-fixing is illegal, a violation of federal and state antitrust laws, 
which were established to ensure that fair competition drives the price for 
goods and services. 
No smoke-filled rooms, lawyer says 
San Diego attorney Mike Aguirre and another team of lawyers, suing on behalf 
of the city of San Francisco, say the Web sites were a new kind of collusion, 
made possible by two things: a market dominated by just a few players, and 
technology that allowed those players to view the same live data in the same 
format. 
Aguirre said they knew this would make it possible to take the same actions 
to drive up prices. The Web sites were part of the plan, and it worked, he 
said. 
"They are now marching lockstep and communicating in the way a cartel 
communicates, only they are actually much more sophisticated - you aren't 
going to catch them together in some smoky room," said Aguirre. 
By the time the two main sites were shut down because of complaints that they 
were being used to drive up prices, the generators had a lock on the market 
and understood the nuances of how to manipulate it, he said. The Independent 
System Operator believes the Web site data were used last summer to "exercise 
market power and (for) gaming in the real market." The accusation was made in 
an Oct. 10 letter to owners of the coordinating council Web site. 
State power grid officials said they routinely saw power producers triple 
their prices within minutes of a bottleneck on a transmission line. Kellan 
Fluckiger, the grid's operations vice president, likened it to a closure on a 
state highway that might give businesses - that know they are the final stop 
for bread or water - the incentive to mark up prices and take advantage of a 
captive clientele. 
"We saw generators on the right side of the congestion change their bids from 
$50 a megawatt(-hour) to $150 immediately after there was a clog in the 
line," said Fluckiger. 
Another strategy to create price spikes, according to grid manager Jim 
Detmers, was to intentionally pull generators offline to create scarcity. 
Reliant Energy Vice President John Stout said neither his company nor his 
competitors used the Web site data to fix electricity prices. 
"There are two sides to this. On the one hand you can say that people were 
able to quickly start up their generators to keep the lights on," Stout said. 
"On the other hand you can say that someone kept generators offline to 
extract more money. But that didn't happen. Shutting down a generator when 
there's an opportunity to sell energy isn't a wise thing to do." 
Utility executives - who bought power from the generating companies - have 
fought for the live data to be restricted to those responsible for managing 
the transmission lines. For everyone else, they want it embargoed for a week 
or more. 
"A delay should be enough to prevent real-time action - using the information 
to create congestion or to take advantage of bottlenecks - but would allow 
for analysis later," said Gary Stern, director of market monitoring and 
analysis for Southern California Edison. 
Consumer groups say they are shocked the live data were being shared, because 
power merchants have fought the release of the information to regulators 
investigating the market. 
"The mantra of the energy industry is, 'All this information is protected as 
a trade secret. Regulators, the government, the public can't see any of it 
because it would give competitors too much information,' " said consumer 
advocate Doug Heller. "But internally the companies seem to be more than 
happy to share and have access to crucial market data as a tool to manipulate 
the market." 
Southwestern University law professor Lawrence Sullivan, a national antitrust 
expert, said antitrust cases are tough to prove. Sometimes there is no 
collusion, just a group of individuals or companies presented with similar 
conditions, all reacting in the same way. He uses a rainstorm analogy. 
"Suddenly it starts raining; you put your umbrella up and so does everyone 
else," said Sullivan. "You are acting for you own reasons and you don't care 
if anyone else puts their umbrella up. You are doing it for yourself." 
Equal data sharing in 'transparent market' 
From the regulators' perspective, the only requirement on data-sharing is 
that it be done equally, so that all market participants can take advantage 
of it. Moreover, the federal commission actually requires the OASIS site. 
Commissioner William Massey said the economic principle driving the 
commission's philosophy is that sharing information, or having a "transparent 
market," should foster healthy competition. But Massey concedes California 
has too few players and not enough electricity to have a truly competitive 
market. 
Stanford University economist Frank Wolak - who does market surveillance 
studies for the grid operator - said people expected that federal regulators 
would protect consumers by setting price caps if the market became unwieldy, 
allowing flaws in the market to be worked out. 
He blames federal regulators rather than generators. 
Generators' "job is to maximize profits. It's like asking a predator not to 
seek its prey," said Wolak. "Lions are supposed to eat zebras, but the game 
warden is supposed to do something if they are eating too many zebras. FERC 
has an obligation to do something if the prices are going to kill the 
California economy."

Studies show pitfalls in power market 
Investigators believe the deregulated system has opened itself up to 
manipulation of supply and pricing. 
March 25, 2001 
By KIMBERLY KINDY
The Orange County Register 
Nearly a dozen studies and investigations have found evidence of flaws and 
weaknesses in California's deregulated electricity market that - if detected 
and rooted out earlier - could have prevented the state from spiraling into 
crisis. 
A growing number of lawmakers, energy regulators and academic experts believe 
power producers exploited these weaknesses to "game" the market. 
Earlier this month, the state Senate formed an investigative committee to 
determine if energy producers illegally manipulated the market. The move came 
less than a week after the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ordered power 
producers to refund nearly $70 million for energy sold in January, unless 
they can justify the prices charged. In other words, for the first time the 
onus is on the generators: They must prove they didn't manipulate the market. 
State Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, who will chair the new investigative 
committee, has reviewed piles of evidence collected against the power 
producers and believes it's time to determine whe ther Californians have 
become victims of a new energy cartel. 
"Not only is there a grassy knoll, there are many who believe the gunman is 
still standing there firing," said Dunn, an attorney who has successfully 
litigated against the tobacco industry for engaging in unfair business 
practices. 
The market flaws that allowed for manipulation include: 
The "crazy auction." That is how Gov. Gray Davis described the state's daily 
energy market when the crisis hit. The auction guaranteed that every seller 
would get paid the last bid price. The model was supposed to encourage power 
producers to bid early to avoid being locked out when the utilities had 
enough electricity lined up. But sellers never did fill the energy needs 
early in the day, so by the time the market was about to close, buyers had 
increased their bidding price in an effort to secure enough energy. As a 
result, the sellers were always awarded the highest bid price - even if 90 
percent of the energy had been secured at a lower rate earlier in the day. 
Lack of generation. The California Energy Commission says the state's 
consumption grew by no more than 5 percent from 1999 to 2000, leading many to 
argue that scarcity alone could not have driven the market so out of control. 
However, economists say it may have contributed to the problem. Here's why: 
even with the commission's projections - which are disputed by generators who 
place increases at closer to 20 percent - the rate of consumption was nearly 
equal to the rate of generation. Economists say a healthy market for 
ratepayers will only come when generation exceeds consumption by at least 20 
percent. 
Instant updates. The ability to see real-time, market-sensitive information 
allowed power producers maximum potential for com mand ing the highest 
possible price. Two Web sites in particular allowed generators to see what 
their competitors were up to, minute by minute, as they bought and sold 
energy. The information-sharing is at the heart of two lawsuits filed against 
the power producers, accusing them of violating antitrust laws to fix prices. 
Producers say they did nothing wrong. 
Regulatory gaps. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission had the power to 
step in and set caps to stabilize the market. The idea was to allow the 
private energy suppliers to make profits, but not at rates that will harm the 
economy. The decision not to use this authority emboldened the merchants, 
resulting in increased profits from 1999 to 2000 of more than 300 percent, 
according to consumer groups and a state Independent System Operator filing 
with the federal commission. 
Too few sellers. Even when production levels climb, economists say, the 
marketplace will be better served if more players are introduced. Most of 
California's energy needs have been met by five major suppliers, each having 
about 20 percent of the state's business. Energy and antitrust experts say 
it's too easy to mirror one another's actions and form a mon opoly with a 
group of sellers this small. 
Abrupt shift to a new market. The state didn't build safety bridges from the 
old system to the new. For example, in other states where deregulation has 
been enacted, the utilities sold off their power generators, but only on the 
condition that the new buyers sell them electricity at a locked-in, low rate 
for the first few years. Economists say this would have helped stabilize 
costs until the new market was established. 
Dunn's committee will look at ways to restructure the marketplace so that 
prices can stabilize. But a second goal is to determine whether power 
generators have criminally exploited weaknesses in the marketplace. 
The power generators say they've endured scrutiny in studies and state and 
federal investigations, and that no proof of criminal wrongdoing was found. 
"There have been at least nine investigations that have looked at this ... 
including a federal investigation," said Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director 
of the Independent Energy Producers, a trade organization for power 
generators. "To date no one has concluded there is any illegal activity or 
any other kind of misconduct." 
But Dunn, antitrust experts - and even the researchers -- said these repeated 
claims by power producers and their representatives misstate what the studies 
show. 
Here's why: The academic studies and market surveillance reports never aimed 
to prove illegal activity. Instead their goal was to determine if the Federal 
Power Act needed to be enacted by FERC. The act requires that the federal 
regulators step in when evidence of market power, or monopoly power over 
prices, is being exercised by the generators -something that nearly every 
study found. 
"Their only job is to look at if the market is dysfunctional," said Dunn. 
"They are not looking at it through the lens of a prosecutor." 
MIT economist Paul Joskow said his work shows that supply and demand 
scenarios could not possibly have led to the prices Californians have been 
paying for electricity. Market power had to be exerted, but he said he didn't 
have the power to subpoena documents or witnesses that might have revealed 
illegal activity. 
"My objective was not to determine if anyone engaged in illegal behavior," 
said Joskow, who conducted research that was funded by Edison International. 
"It was designed to assist FERC ... then it was up to FERC to decide the 
implications in enforcing the Federal Power Act, which requires that they set 
just and reasonable prices." 
Joskow's work showed that prices, in many instances, were twice as high as 
they should have been. 
Stanford University economist Frank Wolak, who heads a team of economists 
that conducts regular market surveillance reports for California's main 
electricity grid operator, said he has repeatedly found evidence of market 
manipulation and reported it to FERC. 
In 2000 alone, Wolak said, his work showed that market manipulation accounted 
for an $8 billion overcharge out of the $27 billion that was paid for 
electricity in the California market. 
However, no action was ever taken by federal officials. 
"It's frustrating because they say, 'Be very vigilant in searching for market 
power,' but when we find it, they don't do anything," Wolak said. "They say, 
'Oh no, that's not market power.' If they would define what market power is, 
we would be looking for it. But I don't think they want us to find it." 
Wolak said he believes that recent actions by federal officials - in which 
they have ordered refunds - represent a token gesture and are a response to 
intense public pressure for them to act. So far, they've identified less than 
$80 million in potential overcharges, compared with the billions that Wolak 
and others have identified. 
One federal commissioner agrees with Wolak. Commissioner William Massey said 
the commission has resisted stepping in and using its authority because it 
believed the free market would correct itself. Massey said members are 
beginning to intervene, but he, too, believes the actions should be more 
aggressive. 
"We have been the beneficiaries of countless market monitoring reports for 
two or three years now. Very sophisticated reports that have talked about the 
existence of market power," Massey said. "I think we should have heeded those 
warnings. I think we should have done a better job." 
Last year, FERC did its own investigation to determine if power producers 
were conspiring and intentionally taking generators offline to drive up 
prices. But that study - often cited by power generators as proof that they 
have been cleared of wrongdoing - was cursory. 
FERC described the work as an "informal investigation" and said at the 
beginning of the report that it did not subpoena witnesses or documents. Most 
of the work was done over the telephone with a few power plants subjected to 
scheduled inspections. 
"That FERC study was ridiculous," said Severin Borenstein, director of the 
University of California Energy Institute. "They asked (the power producers) 
if they were manipulating. I guess I wasn't surprised by their answer." 
Attorneys who have accused the power producers of breaking anti-trust laws 
said they are using the academic studies to help them with their own 
investigations. 
But they serve as a starting point. 
The lawyers are looking at the evidence found by researchers - why they 
believed the market was being manipulated - and will subpoena the necessary 
people and records to see if there is proof that illegal actions were behind 
the manipulation. 
"It's not all in one place, and it's not sitting on a silver platter, but we 
believe it's out there," said Len Simon, an attorney working on the city of 
San Francisco's lawsuit filed against power producers. "They (academic 
researchers) have found evidence that these high prices are not purely the 
result of market forces, but they have not been able to secure conclusive 
proof. That's what we plan to do."

Headed toward 'disaster' 
Analysts: California fails in bid to get handle on crisis
By Steve GeissingerSACRAMENTO BUREAU 
SACRAMENTO -- Big power rate hikes. Dangerous rolling blackouts. Volatile 
utility bankruptcies. 
For months, all were deemed nightmares to be thwarted at virtually any cost. 
Yet now they all appear likely, even inevitable, according to experts who see 
California tumbling from an energy crisis into something worse. 
"We're getting closer andcloser to a situation that could be described as a 
disaster for the state," said James Swee-ney, director of Stanford 
University's energy institute. 
Energy woes are starting to hinder California's economy, the sixth largest in 
the world. 
At the same time, Gov. Gray Davis' 11th-hour, multibillion-dollar attack on 
the crisis starting last winter has so sapped the state budget that 
government fiscal watchdogs say it's even a potential threat to essential 
ongoing programs. 
And despite the effort, analysts say California appears headed toward just 
what Davis and legislative leaders most feared -- major rate hikes that would 
eat into consumers' budgets and a summer filled with rolling blackouts that 
endanger people and pummel businesses. 
"These were the sort of things we said would happen unless the governor and 
lawmakers started taking actions beyond what they've been willing to take," 
Sweeney said. 
But the state's quest to ease the energy price and supply crisis amid a 
tangle of powerful, competing interests has turned into such a roller coaster 
ride of ups, downs and surprises that increasing clashes and frustration are 
slowing or even derailing proposed remedies. 
By default, experts say, the utilities may wind up in bankruptcies that throw 
the energy crisis and California's fate largely to the federal courts. 
Signs of trouble abound: 
Rolling blackouts during two spring days earlier this week were caused in 
part by small generators shutting down after utilities missed making payments 
for months. Many view the outages, the first since January and the first to 
strike Southern California, as a harbinger of summer woes despite attempts to 
foster greater conservation and build power plants. 
Though there have been lurches toward an agreement, negotiators apparently 
remain substantially apart in secret talks on a state plan to financially 
rescue nearly bankrupt utilities. 
Major stakeholders in the energy crisis, and their court cases, continue to 
threaten the utilities with bankruptcy at any time. 
The fiscally ailing utilities continue to seek rate increases from state 
regulators -- a move that politicians fearing voter backlash oppose but 
energy and economic experts support as the quickest way out of the crisis. 
With the state's bill for short-term power buys hitting $4 billion, some 
lawmakers are resisting the administration's requests for additional funds. 
The governor, who has declared a state of emergency, has the authority to tap 
funds on his own but fears the political fallout. 
Long-term power contracts negotiated by the state won't cover as large a part 
as hoped of California's demand for electricity until 2004, indicating that 
the state will be forced to seek power for some time on the costly short-term 
market. 
Many more power generators, frustrated at not being paid by the utilities, 
may either cease operations or start selling out of state. 
There remains little sign that federal regulators will order tough wholesale 
price caps, though there are now indications they may pressure generators to 
rebate some alleged overcharges. Numerous government investigations are 
looking into allegations of price gouging. 
Critics are balking at secrecy shrouding the Davis administration's costly, 
short-term power buys to thwart rolling blackouts, purchase of long-term 
contracts and utility bailout talks. Officials say the secrecy is needed to 
avoid skewing the market. 
Some critics say the state is failing to address natural gas supplies and 
costs, an underlying cause of the crisis. Republican lawmakers have futilely 
called for a special legislative session, as was convened on power woes, to 
address the issue. 
Municipal utilities, including Alameda, Palo Alto, Lodi and Santa Clara, say 
they are tired of being asked to participate in rolling blackouts. And 
they've provided power to the grid, for which they haven't been repaid. 
Nowhere recently has the tension over the crisis emerged more publicly than 
in the Legislature, where thwarting utility bankruptcies has been the mantra 
of the administration and legislative leaders for months.Lawmakers' outrage 
But several lawmakers were outraged earlier this week as they battled 
utilities' reluctance to repay the state or small generators for power. 
"Let'em go belly up," said Senate leader John Burton, D-San Francisco. "I 
don't care anymore." 
Sen. Debra Bowen, chair of the Senate energy and utilities committee, said 
she felt "the legislative equivalent of road rage" at Pacific, Gas and 
Electric, which serves Northern California, and Southern California Edison. 
The utilities, trapped between skyrocketing electricity prices and capped 
retail rates, amassed $14 billion in debts that left them teetering on the 
edge of bankruptcy, unable to buy power. The state has spent $4 billion 
brokering power sales as it works on a rescue plan for the utilities.$50 
million daily 
But negotiations on a bond-backed bailout of the utilities appear stalled. In 
the meantime, the state is continuing to broker power sales on their behalf 
at the staggering cost of about $50 million daily. 
Controller Kathleen Connell earlier this week blocked what she described as 
Davis' effort to tap billions more in state money for the energy crisis, 
saying such a transfer of funds could leave California short of cash for 
essential services such as public schools. 
Since the state started making emergency power buys in January, the budget 
surplus has fallen from $8.5 billion to about $3.2 billion, she said. 
Likewise, Sen. Steve Peace, D-El Cajon, chairman of the joint Legislative 
Budget Committee, has warned the Davis administration that he will try to 
block additional funds for emergency, short-term power purchases. 
Peace wants to see the state Public Utilities Commission make progress toward 
recovering from utilities the money that already has been spent. 
The state budget also is being endangered by slow progress toward issuing 
bonds that are intended to repay coffers for short- and long-term power buys, 
according to Connell. 
The delay is due in part to action by the utilities, which are appealing a 
ruling by the PUC that essentially ensures the state will be repaid. 
In the face of myriad signs of trouble, Davis asserts that he is making 
steady, certain progress toward solution of the crisis. 
But Davis' aides privately acknowledge that his fate is inevitably tied to 
his handling of the crisis.Jones'opportunity? 
A potential Republican opponent during Davis' re-election bid next year, 
Secretary of State Bill Jones, is pressing what he views as an opportunity 
big enough to drive his campaign through in 2002. 
Under Davis' leadership, Jones said, California is "essentially mortgaging 
our future for our children and grandchildren." 
Meanwhile, consumer advocates are still threatening a 2002 initiative that 
would overturn rate increases and any taxpayer-financed bailout of 
investor-owned utilities. 
"Davis has not taken the action that is needed to solve this problem," said 
Harvey Rosenfield of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. "Unless 
he does, he's finished."

Experts predict summer outages Some say conserving not enough
By Mike Taugher
TIMES STAFF WRITER 
For months, the brains guiding California's approach to resolving the state's 
energy crisis have been focused on getting through the summer. 
They now must be wondering if they will make it through the spring. 
California was plunged deeper into crisis last week on a variety of fronts as 
authorities escalated their claims that hugely profitable power companies are 
largely to blame. 
Two days of widespread rolling blackouts. Small generators shutting down 
because they have not been paid, and state legislators unable to agree on how 
to bring them back. Accusations that big generators have overcharged 
billions. State officials scrambling to protect a once-generous surplus that 
is hemorrhaging. The revelation that Gov. Gray Davis' efforts to secure 
long-term contracts for cheap electricity have so far fallen short of 
expectations. 
All in all, one hell of a week. 
And this is supposed to be the easy time of year. 
The state's energy crisis is deepening. Positions are hardening, and the way 
out of this mess has never looked so difficult. 
But it is the coming summer months, when peak demand for electricity will be 
50 percent higher than it is now, that is of greatest concern to policymakers 
and energy officials. 
Most experts agree that there is a bona fide shortage of electricity; 
official state estimates are in the range of 5,000 to 7,000 megawatts in the 
summer, or enough to power 5 million to 7 million homes. 
The California Energy Commission says, however, that with strong conservation 
efforts and new power plants, blackouts can be averted. 
Others are not so optimistic. 
An influential East Coast energy consulting firm recently estimated the state 
will see 20 hours of outages in the coming months, but others fear it will be 
far worse. 
One industry representative said the number of blackouts would be in the 
dozens. And he said if high wholesale prices have shocked anyone, they could 
double again before summer is out. 
"The prices are going to be more damaging than they are right now," said Gary 
Ackerman, director of the Western Power Trading Forum, an association of 
energy generators and traders. "I would say in the range of $500 to $600." 
Consider this: A year ago one megawatt-hour was going for $30. Last summer, 
wholesale prices rose to nearly $150, and that was high enough to drive the 
state's two largest utilities to near-bankruptcy and force a state bailout. 
Today, as the state shells out $50 million a day to keep the lights on, 
prices are at about $300. 
The reasons that experts give for the problems that California faces this 
summer are numerous and many are well-documented. No major new power plants 
built in a decade. A growing, technology-dependent population that is using 
more and more power. Drought in the Pacific Northwest. Growing Western states 
using the juice they used to sell to the Golden State. And now small 
generators are shutting down or threatening to sell out of state because they 
have not been paid. 
But there is also growing evidence that many of the problems are caused by 
generators and traders unfairly taking advantage of a dysfunctional market, 
some analysts said. 
"The other thing that makes this summer a little tenuous is last summer our 
experience with generators and traders timing the market to maximize their 
profit," said Claudia Chandler, spokeswoman for the California Energy 
Commission. 
Because of mild weather last summer, the highest peak of demand for 
electricity was actually slightly less than it was in the summers of 1999 and 
1998, when electric restructuring took effect. 
And yet it was not until last year that the state's wholesale electricity 
market went haywire. In San Diego, the first part of the state where retail 
rates were deregulated, consumer bills doubled and in some cases tripled 
while the state's two largest utilities began their slide toward the brink of 
bankruptcy. 
A growing number of experts now say generators and traders, beginning last 
summer, began exercising unfair influence over a market where the margin 
between supply and demand is razor thin. 
A dramatic example of how that influence is exercised would be where a power 
plant owner closes a unit to decrease supply and drive prices up high enough 
to make up for lost production with sales from other units. Earlier this 
month, federal regulators accused two companies of doing just that in 
Southern California during April and May of last year. 
More common, experts say, is generators and traders offering for sale less 
than a full supply of electricity so that the state is thrown into a 
panic-buying situation to secure enough electricity to prevent blackouts. 
"What they are doing is perfectly legal," Chandler said. "But what they are 
able to do is put just enough megawatts into the market to keep the prices 
high. 
"From the standpoint of supply and demand, there's enough supply in 
California to meet demand, assuming we get this new generation on line and 
increase energy efficiency," she added. "The unknown is whether the 
generators and traders are going to put electricity into the grid that is not 
being controlled by contracts. That's the unknown." 
Industry representatives vehemently deny they are doing anything but 
producing all the electricity they can and putting it into the market. High 
prices and shortages, they say, are simply due to the tight margin between 
supply and demand, combined with the high cost of natural gas and pollution 
controls. 
"In a market that's tight, if you have power chasing itself all over the 
western United States, you're going to have high prices," said Jan 
Smutny-Jones, director of the Independent Energy Producers Association. 
"We're getting tired of being the public policy piata here." 
Smutny-Jones and other energy officials say they are convinced they will be 
exonerated, and in the meantime they suggest investigating their activities 
could prove damaging. 
Blaming generators, he said, could lead generators to decide the political 
and regulatory atmospheres are too unstable. 
"The supply that California needs to work its way out of this is not going to 
show up, or if it does show up, it will show up with a significant premium," 
Smutny-Jones said. 
Still, accusations of unfair market practices escalated last week when the 
state's grid manager, the Independent System Operator, complained to federal 
regulators that generators and traders reaped $6.2 billion in excess profits. 
Even the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which has been loathe to take 
a strong stance in California, has recently demanded that power companies 
refund tens of millions of dollars for prices the federal body says were 
excessive in December and January. 
"I think the generators have gotten smarter about how to make money in the 
market," said Severin Borenstein, director of the University of California's 
Energy Institute. 
Borenstein is among those who believe generators are exercising market power. 
Although any given generator might own 5 percent or 6 percent of the state's 
generation capacity, when margins are so tight an individual company can 
spell the difference between keeping the lights on or forcing outages. 
That gives those generators the power to force prices to go up artificially 
high, said Borenstein. 
But even some of the generators' harshest critics acknowledge that the 
problem is not confined to market behavior. 
The shortage is real, experts say. 
And drought in the Pacific Northwest is particularly worrisome, since 
Northern California relies heavily on hydroelectric dams in that region 
during the summer, and transmission constraints will make it difficult, if 
not impossible, to make up for that shortfall with power imports from the 
Southwest. 
"Any time you have more rain in L.A. than in Seattle, you're going to have 
trouble," said Patrick Dorinson, a spokesman at the California Independent 
System Operator. 
In response to worries about what the next several months will bring, the 
governor has launched an intense, multi-faceted plan designed to avert 
blackouts and prevent a financial catastrophe. 
Davis and other Californians also have urged federal regulators to cap 
wholesale prices before summer. But FERC commissioners and the Bush 
administration have been opposed to price caps, saying they don't work and 
would drive electricity out of the western market. 
And to date, Davis' plans to minimize the damage this summer have not shown 
results. His drive to secure long-term contracts has so far come up short, 
and the keystone effort to buy the transmission lines of the utilities has 
stalled. 
Still to be determined is the success of his efforts to bring more generation 
on line and encourage Californians to conserve electricity at unprecedented 
levels. 
Last year, San Diegans had the strongest incentive possible to conserve 
electricity. They were paying the real market cost of power, and that was 
doubling and in some cases tripling their electricity bills. 
But San Diegans conserved only about 9 percent during that time, according to 
a source at the ISO. What's more, once lawmakers recapped their electric 
rates and removed their price incentive, customers of San Diego Gas & 
Electric immediately reverted to their old levels of electricity use, 
according to the ISO source. 
Davis, meanwhile, is counting on Californians to heed his call for 10 percent 
voluntary reduction in usage with no price incentive at all, except that 
those who conserve an ambitious 20 percent during the entire summer will 
receive a rebate. 
Borenstein said the ISO's information about San Diego's electricity use last 
summer is consistent with what he has seen, but he noted that the price 
incentive was not as clear as it might appear. 
As soon as electric bills soared, Borenstein said, politicians began 
agitating customers to not pay their bills. 
So consumers never really thought they were going to be punished for high 
use. 
He thinks it would be good to raise rates because, he said, that will reduce 
consumption. 
"Rate increases, unfortunately, are not at all inevitable," he said. "We 
could pay for all of this through the state treasury." 
Either way, he said, Californians will pay.

Calif To OK 20% Rate Hike For Utils Tue - Commissioner
By Jason Leopold
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

03/24/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The California Public Utilities Commission will 
likely approve a 20% rate increase for two of the state's largest utilities 
Tuesday, ending a three-year-old retail rate freeze, two PUC commissioners 
told Dow Jones Newswires Saturday. 
The rate hike would let the state recoup money it spent buying power since 
January, said the commissioners, who asked not to be named. The increase also 
would let utilities start paying small independent power producers on a 
forward basis for electricity sold directly to the utilities, the 
commissioners said.
PUC also may approve a trigger mechanism. The move would allow utilities PG&E 
Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric and Edison International (EIX) unit 
Southern California Edison additional rate increases of 5%, if needed, to 
cover future power costs. Rates could go down if the future price of power 
stabilizes, the commissioners said. 
A PUC administrative law judge is expected to issue a proposed order that 
does not support the rate increase and end to the rate freeze. As a result, 
PUC Commission President Loretta Lynch is expected to issue an alternate 
proposal that will call for a rate increase of about 20%, the commissioners 
said. 
Both proposed orders are expected to be issued Sunday afternoon. 
"There is just no way we can extract 10 cents from a nickel," said one 
Democratic commissioner, who asked not to be named. "Unfortunately, we are 
going to have to grant the utilities an increase." 

SoCal Ed To Present Rate Arguments Monday 

The commission is expected to hear oral arguments Monday by SoCal Ed 
executives regarding the company's rate stabilization plan. When first 
presented to the commission in November, the plan called for a 10% rate 
increase. PG&E also filed a rate stabilization plan at the time asking for a 
similar increase. 
Both utilities argued last November that their costs exceeded their revenues 
because wholesale power prices spiked during the summer. The utilities' 
customers' rates were frozen, but wholesale prices continued to soar, 
surpassing the roughly 5.5 cents per kilowatt hour and 6.5 cents/KWh rate the 
utilities were legally allowed to charge their customers. 
In December, PG&E and SoCal Ed revised their rate stabilization plan, 
requesting rate increases of as much as 30% because wholesale power prices 
failed to stabilize and the utilities were getting deeper into debt. The 
commission denied the request in January and approved a temporary rate 
increase of 9% for residential consumers and 14% for large industrial 
customers. 
PG&E and SoCal Ed are now more than $13 billion in debt, have seen their 
ratings downgraded to junk-status by Wall Street credit agencies and have 
defaulted on billions of dollars in dividend payments, power bills and bank 
loans. 
Gov. Gray Davis was in Palm Springs over the weekend for a fundraiser, and 
his staff was unavailable for comment. Representatives for PG&E and SoCal Ed 
were also unavailable for comment. 
Earlier this month, Davis told Wall Street analysts that he would not allow a 
rate increase because he feared a ballot initiative by consumer advocates in 
the state, who would call for an end to the state's deregulation law. 
"Believe me, if I wanted to raise rates I could have solved this problem in 
20 minutes," Davis said at a March news conference. 

Group Pledges 'Ratepayer Revolt' If Prices Rise 

Harvey Rosenfield, executive director of consumer advocacy group The 
Foundation of Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, promised a "ratepayer revolt" and 
2002 ballot initiative if electricity rates are increased. Consumer advocates 
are also expected to testify at Monday's hearing about why the utilities 
should not be permitted to raise consumer electricity rates. 
Legislative sources said the rate increase is needed so the state Department 
of Water Resources, which in January started purchasing power for the 
cash-strapped utilities, can be repaid. Moreover, the utilities can begin 
paying the state's so-called qualifying facilities for electricity. PG&E and 
SoCal Ed have not paid the QFs in full since January, and the companies owe 
the generators about $1 billion. 
In hindsight, one key Democratic state senator said, if the state allowed the 
utilities to raise rates in January, the DWR would not have had to spend 
nearly $4 billion from the general fund buying power. Further, said the 
senator, who asked not to be named, the state would not have had to negotiate 
a deal to buy the utilities' power lines in an effort to restore the 
companies to financial stability. 
"Think about it. PG&E and Edison could have regained access to loans and 
would have been able to restore their credit," the senator said. "We 
ultimately spent more than $5 billion than we should have if a rate increase 
is approved. That's not counting, the billions of dollars more we spent and 
are going to spend on long-term contracts, transmission assets and revenue 
bonds. People are going to want answers and I don't know what we're going to 
tell them."

Few share Davis' view on rate hike: Even aides predict big power cost boost
By Dan Smith and Amy Chance
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published March 25, 2001) 
With new threats of fiscal distress descending on California's power industry 
and the state treasury, Gov. Gray Davis finds himself increasingly alone in 
his belief that the state can weather the energy crisis without significant 
electricity rate increases. 
Top lawmakers and other key officials involved in sorting through the crisis 
-- including some of Davis' own staffers -- now believe rates need to rise, 
perhaps to double. And they said the Public Utilities Commission is likely to 
signal that some rate increase is needed when it meets this week. 
"I think the facts finally came out in terms of the magnitude of the 
problem," said Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco. "You 
have to get the money from somewhere -- unless you steal it or win a lottery 
ticket ... I don't know how you solve this problem without (a rate increase) 
and I never really saw how you could solve it without one." 
The assumptions the Democratic governor has relied on to bolster his "hope 
and expectation" that rates won't rise beyond the already anticipated 19 
percent increase are rapidly falling apart. 
As the crisis drags on, the state will have to spend far more than anyone 
expected in January for short-term power purchases, long-term contracts and 
the utilities' transmission lines. 
Davis had also hoped the state could strike a deal to rein in the costs the 
utilities pay alternative energy suppliers, but by week's end suppliers were 
balking and previous legislative agreements began to disintegrate. 
On March 7, state Treasurer Phil Angelides had recommended the state 
initially sell $10 billion in bonds to help the state purchase power, saying 
a significantly larger-scale bond issue would increase costs for ratepayers. 
The Senate on Thursday approved a bill it thought would make that possible. 
But by Friday, neither Republican lawmakers nor the Davis administration was 
on board. 
Key lawmakers were told by high-level Davis staffers that the state may need 
to borrow as much as $23 billion -- and raise rates by as much as 60 percent 
to 80 percent above the initial 19 percent to support it -- over the next 18 
to 24 months. 
Davis, meanwhile, was in the Palm Springs area for most of the day Friday. As 
negotiations continued in the stalemated Assembly, Davis attended a campaign 
fund-raising luncheon at a top desert golf resort. His spokesman, Steve 
Maviglio, said the governor did not play golf, but attended the event between 
a morning groundbreaking ceremony and a mid-afternoon television interview. 
"It's insane and disgusting at this point," said Doug Heller of the 
Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. "Governor Davis is unfortunately 
tending to his campaign coffers more effectively than he is tending to the 
state's energy needs. He is double-bogeying his round as governor." 
One administration source said some Davis advisers have been calling for a 
rate increase for weeks. Maviglio said Saturday that the governor has not 
been briefed on the most current financial models with which his negotiators 
and legislators are working. 
"The governor has not signed off (on a rate increase)," Maviglio said. "What 
the staff says doesn't matter. ... There's absolutely no change with what 
he's said all along." 
But others said it is time the governor confronted the reality of a rate 
increase. 
On Friday -- after his briefing with the administration -- Assembly Speaker 
Robert Hertzberg, D-Sherman Oaks, said, "it seems more inevitable that the 
Public Utilities Commission will have to raise rates." 
Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, for months a key player in the 
energy talks, concluded a month ago that state 
policy-makers have little ability to influence the price and availability of 
power in the short term. 
"Even if the governor and the Legislature acted in perfect harmony, the 
ability of state government to effectuate an outcome is very, very limited," 
Keeley said. "My guess is the force of events -- the enormity of the 
economics involved in this -- are playing out and that the administration is 
coming to the same conclusion." 
Angelides said the numbers suggest the state can't survive financially under 
the current rate structure. 
"There's a limit to how much you want to sell bonds to keep delaying 
reality," he said. "At the end of the day the PUC is going to have to set 
rates that allow the state to buy power and the state and utilities to 
recover their costs. It is certainly worth borrowing money to repay the 
general fund, but then you have to ask: 'How many billions are we willing to 
borrow to delay the tough reality of where we are?' " 
Heller, whose group vigorously opposes any rate increase, said he believes 
Davis is politically averse to boosting voters' energy bills -- but at the 
same time doesn't want to take the steps necessary to crack down hard on 
energy generators, such as seizing power plants or imposing a windfall 
profits tax. 
That leaves the Legislature little choice, he said, but to embrace a rate 
increase as necessary. 
"It's political suicide, but they have to be considering throwing this right 
on (power) bills, and using blackouts as a mechanism to scare us into 
accepting these rate increases," he said. "The Legislature appears to be the 
fall guy for the governor's weakness." 
Keeley said Davis could help the situation -- and perhaps be viewed as 
courageous -- if he publicly embraced a rate increase soon. 
"It would end the fantasy that this situation could be stabilized without a 
rate increase," Keeley said. "That fiction -- and the effort to maintain that 
fiction -- gets in the way of genuine problem solving."

Rising cost of purchasing electricity sparks alarm 
Posted at 11:00 p.m. PST Saturday, March 24, 2001 
BY PAUL ROGERS 

Mercury News 

A chorus of frustration, anger and renewed calls for the state to seize 
privately owned power plants echoed across California Saturday, following 
news that the state might have to spend as much as $23 billion over the next 
two years to buy power to keep the lights on. 
``Where do we go from here? How about off the bridge?'' said Sen. John 
Burton, D-San Francisco. 
``Deregulation has been a disaster in California,'' said Assembly Speaker Pro 
Tem Fred Keeley, D-Santa Cruz. ``Most of us didn't vote on this, but it is 
our job to clean it up. And the cleanup is going to be awful.'' 
Republicans were equally gloomy. 
``The amount of money we are talking about now is so massive that most people 
are shellshocked,'' said Bill Campbell, the Assembly Republican leader from 
Orange. 
The state's energy crisis reached a new level of anxiety among many lawmakers 
Friday, after top staff members for Gov. Gray Davis told legislative leaders 
that the tab for the state to buy power over the next two years might not be 
$10 billion, a previous estimate, but could reach as high as $23 billion. 
The new projections stem in part from the state's failure to sign enough 
long-term contracts for low-cost energy, to move aggressively on an ambitious 
summer energy conservation plan, and to approve a bailout for Pacific Gas & 
Electric Co. and Southern California Edison. 
Sources said the governor's aides estimated the rate increase for consumers 
could be as high as 80 percent to cover the costs. 
`Wildly speculative' 
On Saturday, the governor's office did not confirm or deny the number. 
``There are a differing number of what-if scenarios being played out,'' said 
Steven Maviglio, a spokesman for Davis. Maviglio called the $23 billion 
estimate ``wildly speculative.'' 
He said Davis holds out hope that ratepayers might get ``billions of dollars 
in refunds'' from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The state this 
week alleged that power companies have overcharged California ratepayers by 
$6.2 billion. 
And he said Davis still is trying to avoid having consumers' rates go up, 
something many legislators, including his fellow Democrats, now say is 
unlikely. 
Davis appeared briefly on a CNN television broadcast to discuss the crisis. 
He did not say whether rates would have to be raised, or address the $23 
billion price tag. 
The two leading choices are to raise rates for consumers or sell bonds, which 
would be repaid by ratepayers but would cost more over time because of 
interest. 
``It seems increasingly there isn't a will in the Legislature to finance a 
huge debt over time,'' said John Nelson, a spokesman for PG&E. ``I would say 
a rate increase is more and more likely, whether or not it is the governor's 
first choice.'' 
On CNN, Davis repeated calls for consumers to conserve power by at least 10 
percent this summer and blamed out-of-state power generators for raising 
rates to take advantage of California's flawed 1996 deregulation law. 
``They have what we need, and they are demanding very high prices for it,'' 
Davis said. ``It has driven our utilities to the edge of bankruptcy and 
complicated our problem.'' 
Davis took a backhanded swipe at San Jose, a city that has blocked attempts 
by Calpine Inc. to build a 600-megawatt power plant in Coyote Valley. 
``Everyone has to do their part. Cities can't be turning down plants,'' he 
said. 
Some were calling for more drastic measures. 
Burton, the president pro tem of the state Senate, said that having the state 
forcibly take over by eminent domain and buy out power plants across 
California, many of them operated by Texas and other out-of-state power 
companies, is looking more possible. 
``If these figures are right,'' he said, ``maybe we just go in and buy these 
generation plants. If we are going to spend $20 or $30 billion, we might as 
well own them.'' 
A bill written by Burton to create a state power authority that could build 
and buy power plants passed the Senate last month and is pending in the 
Assembly. 
Davis broached the subject of an eminent domain takeover of power plants in 
his State of the State speech in January. Since then he has said little about 
the option. 
Instead, Davis has tried to fix a flawed 1996 deregulation law by having the 
state enter into long-term contracts to buy power for PG&E and Southern 
California Edison. The two utilities say they have lost more than $13 billion 
since last summer and now teeter on the verge of bankruptcy because they have 
been forced to pay high wholesale electricity costs, and California's 1996 
deregulation law prevents them from raising rates. 
Consumer advocates on Saturday were unequivocal, however. 
``It's time to get the pitchforks and go to the Bastille,'' said Nettie Hoge, 
director of The Utility Reform Network in San Francisco. ``You have to put it 
at the feet of the people who are doing the generating -- the Texas and 
Southern companies.'' 
Hoge said that California residents are in for ``certain blackouts'' this 
summer when energy demand outstrips supply. And with power bills likely to 
rise, she said interest is already high in crafting a ballot measure for 2002 
for the state to take over the power plants. 
``What you have is a huge black hole of generator greed. We have almost 
burned through the state surplus. Somebody has got to put on the brakes,'' 
she said. 
Power producers, however, said that solution would be ill-advised. 
``We would vigorously defend our interests,'' said Tom Williams, spokesman 
for Duke Energy. ``You can't seize property without fair market value. It is 
against the law.'' 
Duke has bought four power plants since 1998, paying $611 million. The 
company has already begun a $1.6 billion effort to upgrade and expand the 
plants, which include former PG&E facilities at Moss Landing and Morro Bay. 
If the state seized the plants, long court battles would ensue. Williams said 
Duke's plants are worth far more than what the firm paid for them, and the 
state would lose tens of millions of dollars in tax revenue. 
Opposition to seizures 
Republicans in Sacramento have opposed seizing power plants, saying it will 
discourage new construction. Campbell said Saturday that if rates have to be 
raised, he favors using the state's surplus for a $6 billion or more tax cut. 
The state Public Utilities Commission is to take up the rate hike on Tuesday. 
So far, the PUC has raised retail electricity rates only 9 percent since the 
crisis began. 
One Democratic leader, Keeley, agreed that costs would be so high for the 
state to seize power plants it might not be worthwhile. He said the state 
should stay the course, and can get by with rate increases, issuing bonds for 
some of the costs and continuing to permit the construction of new power 
plants. 
Keeley also said for the first time Saturday that he is no longer opposed to 
letting PG&E or Southern California Edison go bankrupt. It may be cheaper, he 
said, for the state to take over those companies -- and the one-third of 
California's power they produce -- than continuing to help bail them out. 
Will Davis agree to more radical notions like seizing power plants or 
allowing bankruptcy of the state's venerable utilities? 
One political observer said he will do what the public wants, especially as 
his re-election in November 2002 nears. 
``Gray Davis wants the lights on until the day after the election,'' said 
Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a senior scholar at the School of Policy, Planning and 
Development at the University of Southern California. ``He is a political 
pragmatist. You do what you need to do.''

Bond may fall short, Davis aides fear
Governor holds out hope of keeping a lid on rates

By Ed Mendel 
STAFF WRITER 
March 25, 2001 

SACRAMENTO -- Gov. Gray Davis' administration is concerned that a planned $10 
billion bond issue may fall short of covering power costs, and some think 
utility customers will be hit with a hefty rate increase. 
But a spokesman said yesterday that Davis continues to say his "hope and 
expectation" is that the electricity crisis can be solved without an increase 
in the existing rate structure. 
"He said there is absolutely no change in what he has been saying all along," 
said Steve Maviglio, Davis' press secretary. 
Maviglio said the administration asked the Assembly on Friday to delay action 
on a bill that would limit the bond issue to $10 billion while "some 
cash-flow issues" are studied. 
A Davis energy adviser, Joseph Fichera of Saber Partners, said the 
administration is studying "various scenarios" based on payments to small 
generators, long-term power contracts, the price of natural gas used by 
generators and the cost of buying power on the spot market this summer. 
"We wouldn't be good analysts if we didn't vary assumptions widely on our 
inputs to try to see what comes out of them," Fichera said. 
Maviglio denied reports that the governor's top aides have concluded that a 
rate increase is necessary. 
"We have one anonymous staff (member) saying that," he said. "I can tell you 
from my meetings the whole staff isn't sold on it." 
The state began buying power for utility customers in mid-January after a 
failed deregulation plan drove Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern 
California Edison Co. to the brink of bankruptcy. 
The rates the utilities could charge their customers were frozen as the cost 
of wholesale power soared, producing what the utilities say is a combined 
debt of nearly $13 billion. 
The state has been spending about $1.5 billion a month from the general fund 
to buy power, and $4.2 billion has been earmarked for power purchases so far. 
The plan is to repay the general fund with bonds paid off by utility 
customers. 
The state Treasurer's Office had hoped to obtain a $5 billion, short-term 
"bridge" loan by the end of this month, which would provide funds until the 
$10 billion bond could be issued at the end of May. 
The lawmaker who carried the legislation authorizing the bond issue, 
Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, has said from the outset that a 
rate increase is likely, despite the governor's hope to the contrary. 
Now new estimates of what the state may have to spend to buy power during the 
next two years reportedly are as high as $23 billion. The concern is that 
paying off a bond of that size would force a substantial rate increase. 
Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys, was pessimistic about avoiding 
a rate increase as he spoke with reporters Friday after the Assembly 
adjourned for the weekend. 
"I don't think so," Hertzberg said when asked if a rate increase could be 
avoided. But he quickly added, "I don't know yet." 
The governor wants to use the existing rate to pay off not only the bond to 
buy power, but a second large bond issue to pay off the massive debt of the 
utilities as part of the state purchase of their transmission systems. 
The Public Utilities Commission may consider a proposal Tuesday to reallocate 
revenue from the bills paid by utility customers, giving the state the 
"California procurement adjustment" needed to pay off the power bond. 
Davis also wants the PUC on Tuesday to order PG&E and Edison to begin paying 
small, non-utility generators in the federal "qualifying facilities" program 
that provide about one-quarter of the state's power. 
A number of the small generators have quit operating, contributing to rolling 
blackouts early last week. Edison has not paid the small generators since 
November, and PG&E has only paid 15 percent of what they are owed. 
But paying the small generators, while providing revenue to pay off two large 
bond issues, strains the existing rate structure. PG&E warned Friday that it 
may file a lawsuit if the PUC does not leave enough of the rate revenue for 
the utility to pay its bills. 
The bill that would limit the power bond to $10 billion also contained a 
provision that would no longer require that payments to small generators be 
based on the price of natural gas, which has soared in recent months. 
Small generators who use gas turbines oppose the change, warning that it 
would put them out of business. A third part of the bill would cap the rates 
for businesses served by San Diego Gas & Electric Co. 
Negotiators meeting over the weekend are expected to place the bond limit, 
the small-generator provision and the SDG&E business-rate cap in three 
separate bills.

 FERC weighs wider energy price controls 
By David Whitney
Bee Washington Bureau
(Published June 13, 2001) 
WASHINGTON -- The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission next week is expected 
to extend an existing price-control plan effective only during California 
power emergencies to all 13 Western states and around the clock, 
congressional sources said Tuesday. 
FERC scheduled an unusual Monday meeting to discuss electricity pricing in 
California, a sign that the panel will expand its efforts to rein in high 
wholesale rates. The commission is now up to full strength with the seating 
of two new Bush administration nominees. 
Vice President Dick Cheney, who met for nearly an hour with California 
lawmakers Tuesday, told them the White House, while still strongly opposed to 
price controls, would be closely watching the meeting. 
"We'll see what happens next Monday," Rep. David Dreier, chairman of the 
California Republican delegation, quoted Cheney as saying. 
Other members who attended gave similar reports of Cheney's remarks, 
indicating that the vice president is hoping that whatever the independent 
panel does will ratchet down the political heat the White House has been 
feeling from Western lawmakers because of high wholesale rates. 
Commission press aides were not saying what the nature of Monday's agenda 
would be, other than that it would arise out of the same case in which the 
panel agreed in April to set a benchmark price for wholesale power sold on 
the spot markets during emergencies. 
That order has been widely criticized because it applies only in California 
during periods of near or imminent blackouts and sets the spot-market rate 
for all spot-market suppliers at the cost of production for the most costly, 
least-efficient plant selling into the grid. During such emergencies, 
spot-market sales can account for nearly a third of power deliveries. 
Since the commission's order took effect late last month, wholesale prices 
have plummeted even though they've been triggered only twice by power 
emergency declarations. Other factors, including conservation success and 
lower natural gas prices, also have contributed to that drop. 
According to a price chart cited by the vice president, spot-market prices a 
day ahead of delivery that were $400 a megawatt hour May 22 had dropped to 
less than $50 by June 6, which is close to the going rate before the 
electricity crisis erupted a year ago. 
The idea of broadening the April order to apply throughout the West and 
around the clock was first proposed by Rep. Doug Ose, R-Sacramento, chairman 
of the House Government Reform Committee's energy panel. Rep. Billy Tauzin, 
R-La., chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, urged the 
commission to adopt Ose's idea in a letter Tuesday. 
Ose, citing the periodical Electric Utility Week, said that on the two 
occasions that the commission order was invoked, California's power rates 
fell by almost two-thirds to between $108 and $135 a megawatt hour -- proof 
that it was working to bring prices down. 
Broadening that order is certain to further dampen rates, but Democrats are 
solid in the belief that it won't help enough and raises other concerns. 
"It would be a step in the right direction," said Sen. Barbara Boxer. But she 
said it also would reward the most inefficient, dirty plants by basing 
spot-market rates on their cost of production. 
Gov. Gray Davis and several West Coast lawmakers, most of them Democrats, are 
calling for the commission to re-regulate wholesale rates by basing them on 
production costs plant by plant, with a fixed profit margin, for 18 months or 
so while California builds its way out of the power crisis. 
The commission's meeting Monday comes just as that plea is finding a 
receptive audience in the new Democrat-controlled Senate. 
Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, 
has scheduled a hearing for June 20 at which Davis will be the lead witness 
in an inquiry into whether federal regulators are meeting their 
responsibilities under the Federal Power Act to assure just and reasonable 
rates. 
There have been changes in FERC, too, that may have played an even stronger 
force behind the Monday meeting. When the April order was issued, the 
five-member commission was operating with just three seated members. The vote 
was 2-1, with Commissioner William Massey the lone vote against it. Massey 
said it wouldn't help California, adding that he thought skyrocketing prices 
throughout the West warranted stronger price controls. 
Since then, two new commissioners have joined the panel. Patrick Wood III, 
chairman of the Texas Public Utility Commission who is widely thought to be 
President Bush's choice to take over as FERC chairman, and Pennsylvania 
Utility Commissioner Nora Mead Brownell will attend their first meeting 
today. 
At their confirmation hearing in April, both Wood and Brownell refused to 
rule out price controls. 
Davis' top energy adviser, S. David Freeman, called Wood a "good guy," adding 
that he is "encouraged" that the reconstituted commission was taking up the 
California rate case again. 
While wholesale prices are trending down now, Freeman said they likely would 
soar anew during a prolonged hot spell, and he is powerless to do anything 
about that. 
"We are in desperate need of help from FERC," he said. "This is the most 
massive failure of regulation in the history of electricity regulation. ... 
We feel we are in a war for the economic vitality of the state."

Dan Walters: Repaying huge power debts still looms as a high political hurdle


(Published June 13, 2001) 
Gov. Gray Davis has been running around California lately proclaiming that 
California is "turning the corner" on the energy crisis, explicitly citing 
sharply lower wholesale prices for electricity and, implicitly, his improved 
standing in polls. 
Events will reveal whether Davis' June hubris was justified. Despite the 
recent drop in spot power prices, however, many aspects of the energy crisis 
remain unresolved, and chief among them is liquidating the $20 billion-plus 
in debts that utilities and the state have accumulated for power purchases. 
A $13.4 billion bond issue that is supposed to reimburse the state's general 
fund for more than $8 billion advanced for power purchases and then finance 
future electricity buys has been hung up by demands of potential bond 
underwriters for more assurances about repayment. The bonds may not be sold 
until August, if ever. And by then, nearly the entire bond issue may have to 
flow to the state's general fund, leaving little to finance future power 
buys. 
And then there are the $14 billion or so in debts that the state's two big 
utilities, Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison, incurred 
for power purchases before their credit was cut off in January. PG&E already 
has declared bankruptcy, and Edison was on the verge when Davis hurriedly 
signed a "memorandum of understanding" (MOU) on a rescue scheme, the 
centerpieces being state purchase of Edison's share of the intercity power 
grid, plus a plan for ratepayers to pay off the utility's debts. 
The Edison scheme has been denounced as a "bailout" by consumer activists and 
faces certain legislative rejection, despite a multimillion-dollar lobbying 
and public relations drive by the utility. And it's sparked a complex set of 
private maneuvers in and around the Capitol that are fraying the already cool 
relations between Davis and the Legislature's most powerful leader, Senate 
President Pro Tem John Burton. 
Davis called a dozen senators into his office Monday to press approval of the 
Edison MOU with minimal changes. Burton, who didn't attend, says the governor 
threatened legislators with rejection of their bills or budget appropriations 
if they didn't play ball, and promised retaliation if Davis uses strong-arm 
tactics for Edison. 
"On an issue like this, they (legislators) ought to be able to vote their 
consciences," Burton told reporters, denouncing the Edison deal as a 
"flat-ass bailout." 
Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio rejected Burton's account: "The governor's too 
smart to do any of that." 
As the public squabbling heats up, so is the private search for a compromise 
that Edison, consumerists and other principal players can accept -- without 
much confidence that it can be found. A dizzying array of MOU alternatives is 
being floated, including an effort by Burton and Assembly Speaker Bob 
Hertzberg to persuade Edison creditors to write off part of the debt, and for 
big industrial and power consumers to shoulder the rest in return for 
recapturing the authority to make power supply deals outside the utility 
grid. 
In effect, the plan would create two power systems, one with regulated rates 
for individual and small business customers and unregulated "direct access" 
for big users. Former Assemblyman Phil Isenberg, a lobbyist whose firm 
includes energy generators, is acting as a mediator on behalf of Hertzberg. 
Sources close to the negotiations say the big users won't entertain the deal 
until they know how much power the state has been buying, and at what prices. 
Davis has insisted on keeping that data secret, and has been sued by the news 
media and others to force release, but on Tuesday announced that he will 
agree to opening the supply contracts to inspection. 
The chances of an Edison deal coming together this summer are no better than 
50-50 -- about the same odds of the state's completing its bond sale. And 
those uncertainties are compounded by great fears that California still faces 
the prospect of widespread and prolonged power blackouts this summer. "I 
don't think it's over," Burton said Tuesday in a jab at Davis.

Burton accuses Davis of veto talk 
By Kevin Yamamura
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published June 13, 2001) 
State Senate leader John Burton charged Tuesday that Gov. Gray Davis 
threatened lawmakers earlier this week in an attempt to gain support for a 
struggling deal with Southern California Edison. 
While answering questions on the Edison deal, Burton alleged that Davis 
suggested he would veto non-energy legislation if Senate Democrats did not 
back a deal he struck with Edison in April. 
Davis aides denied the charge, as did some lawmakers, but the episode 
suggested that support for the governor's plan remains distant. 
Davis met Monday with 13 senators as part of an ongoing lobbying effort for 
the Edison deal. Under Davis' tentative agreement, the state would pay the 
utility $2.76 billion for its transmission lines and dedicate a portion of 
electricity rates to help pay off its debts. The deal requires legislative 
approval. 
Burton said he was not invited to the Monday meeting. His claims were based 
on reports from colleagues, he said. 
The Senate leader said the governor told senators that their past support for 
his proposals "didn't mean anything if they voted against this." 
"If that turns out to be the case," Burton said, "I've been around long 
enough to know how to play that game with the executive branch as well." 
"He's too smart to do that," said Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio, referring 
to alleged threats. "I think he expressed his strong support for the 
legislation, but he's too smart to do that." 
Three senators who attended the meeting with Davis disagreed with Burton's 
characterization. One declined comment; others did not return telephone calls 
on the subject. 
"I heard no threats in anything (Davis) said," said Sen. Sheila Kuehl, 
D-Santa Monica. "He said, 'Look, I want my bill to go up for a vote.' And we 
said, 'As it stands, we're not sure how much support it has.' " 
Two months after the Edison deal was first unveiled, most lawmakers have 
rejected it as written. Leaders in both houses are discussing various 
alternatives to the governor's plan, which is contained in legislation by 
Sen. Richard Polanco, D-Los Angeles. 
"As it is before us, it is nothing more than a bailout for the utilities," 
Burton said. 
He reiterated Tuesday that he wants to see generators and creditors take a 30 
percent cut in the debt they are owed for energy purchases. He is supportive 
of a plan that would shift costs to big energy consumers and protect 
residents. 
Burton also unveiled three new energy proposals Tuesday. One would require 
the California Energy Commission to provide backup power for high-priority 
traffic signals. Another would prevent a 10 percent rate increase scheduled 
to take effect next year. The third is a resolution that would support the 
governor in seizing power plants. 
"We're going to show him that there is support in the Senate for seizing 
these power plants from these generators who, in fact, have been ripping us 
off," Burton said. 
Discussions on the governor's Edison proposal could begin as soon as next 
week. Three Senate committees -- judiciary, energy and natural resources -- 
are likely to take up the bill. 
Maviglio said that the governor remains open to changes to the deal -- a 
compromise Davis will have to make given that few lawmakers are willing to 
support the existing plan. 
"I don't think there's a lot of support for (the deal) as it is, in every 
aspect now," Kuehl said. "But I would say that among my colleagues, there is 
support for purchasing some assets in exchange for enabling Edison to come 
back to health."

PG&E trustee rips execs' bonus plan 
By Claire Cooper
Bee Legal Affairs Writer
(Published June 13, 2001) 
SAN FRANCISCO -- The U.S. bankruptcy trustee has blasted a proposal by 
Pacific Gas and Electric Co.'s top managers to pay themselves millions of 
dollars for sticking with the utility as it navigates a course through its 
financial chaos. 
The utility asked U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali May 25 for permission 
to pay $17.5 million to 223 members of its "leadership team." The official 
committee of PG&E creditors has expressed support for the plan, which has 
drawn criticism from consumer groups. 
In filing a formal statement of opposition on Monday, trustee Linda Ekstrom 
Stanley, who serves as the court's administrator, pointed out that the plan 
would benefit only the top 1 percent of the PG&E work force, and give 20 top 
managers more than $5 million. 
That focus, said Stanley, "suggests those employees with the most to gain are 
the active proponents" of the plan. 
Bonuses aren't needed to keep top managers on the job because the utility is 
in no danger of folding and because the managers aren't likely to walk away 
from their pay and retirement packages, Stanley said. 
If PG&E wants to hand out incentives, Stanley suggested that it consider 
giving stock in its parent company, PG&E Corp. 
Stanley made a distinction between PG&E's bonus plan and those of other 
debtors in bankruptcy that have rewarded loyal employees, such as America 
West Airlines. In 1994, America West was given bankruptcy court permission to 
reward rank and file employees who had stayed with the airline through wage 
cuts and other misfortunes not experienced by PG&E managers, she said. 
Montali has set a hearing on the matter for Monday.

Congress presses regulators to lower electricity prices in West 



By H. Josef Hebert
ASSOCIATED PRESS 
June 12, 2001 
WASHINGTON ) Federal regulators came under growing congressional pressure 
Tuesday to act further to lower the price of electricity in the West and stem 
alleged abuses by power producers. 
Democrats, who just became the Senate's majority party, planned hearings on 
Western electricity prices including a look Wednesday into the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission's handling of the power crisis. 
The FERC, which regulates wholesale electricity transactions and natural gas 
transport, has stepped up its activities in recent weeks and plans a special 
meeting next Monday on California's power markets. Regulators are expected to 
decide at that meeting whether to take additional steps to rein in prices. 
Meanwhile, political support has been growing on Capitol Hill, even among 
some Republicans, for legislation to force FERC to impose temporary price 
caps on Western power sales. 
In recent days, wholesale electricity prices have dropped significantly in 
California and the Northwest, but the threats still loom of a price rebound 
and, in California, power blackouts. 
The Bush administration remains strongly opposed to even limited price 
controls that interfere in the free market. 
Vice President Dick Cheney, in a meeting Tuesday with more than three dozen 
Republican and Democratic lawmakers from California, said the administration 
remains opposed "to any type of price control legislation," according to 
lawmakers present. 
But Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., who became chairman of the Energy and Natural 
Resources Committee when Democrats assumed the Senate majority, warned FERC 
to take additional action or face legislation demanding price caps. 
"I hope that FERC will act more aggressively," Bingaman said during an energy 
forum, "and we will not have to have legislation." 
But he said he was prepared to move a bill out of his committee before the 
July 4 recess, similar to one offered by Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., 
and Gordon Smith, R-Ore., that would require FERC to impose electricity price 
controls based on cost of production and a reasonable profit. 
At the same time, the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, chaired by Sen. 
Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., planned to hear Wednesday from several energy 
economists about FERC's handling of wholesale power markets in the West. Most 
of the witnesses, including Cornell economist Alfred Kahn, an advocate of 
electricity deregulation, have urged additional price controls under current 
circumstances. 
While most Republicans, following the White House lead, remain opposed to 
legislating price caps, there have been growing fears among GOP House members 
about potential political fallout over high Western electricity prices. 
In a letter to FERC Chairman Curtis Hebert on Tuesday, Rep. Billy Tauzin, 
R-La., chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, and 14 other GOP 
lawmakers urged FERC to be more aggressive in pursing allegations of price 
abuse and to expand the limited price mitigation program it approved in 
April. 
That order by FERC reins in wholesale electricity prices when California's 
electricity reserves fall below 7.5 percent, triggering an emergency. It 
limits prices to those charges for power from the most inefficient power 
plants. 
California Gov. Gray Davis has called the FERC limits inadequate and said 
they've had little impact on prices. Tauzin, however, cited evidence that 
FERC's order already has dampened electricity prices, which recently have 
fell significantly. 
The letter to FERC calls for the same mitigation to be broadened to include 
all power transaction, not only those during emergencies, and for the limits 
to be expanded to include other parts of the Western power grid. 
Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, chairman of a key Energy and Commerce subcommittee, 
was among those who signed the letter, but he said he opposes broader price 
controls such as those favored by most congressional Democrats. 
"There have been no instances where price caps have worked," insisted Barton 
at an energy forum sponsored by The Atlantic Monthly. The recent easing of 
electricity prices shows "the market has begun to work," he said. 
House Minority leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., said at a news conference that 
price caps pegged to the cost of producing power are needed "to restore 
reliable and affordable" electricity supplies. 
"Price controls are catastrophic," retorted Majority Leader Dick Armey, 
R-Texas. "If you want blackouts in California, have price controls. He and 
other Republicans say price controls inhibit electricity supplies.

Cheney: No help from administration on power prices 



By Mark Sherman
ASSOCIATED PRESS 
June 12, 2001 
WASHINGTON ) Vice President Dick Cheney told Californians in Congress Tuesday 
not to expect energy price controls from the Bush administration 
The reaction of Democrats ranged from disappointment to anger. 
"We just got blown off by the vice president," said Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Los 
Angeles, as she left the private meeting with Cheney at the Capitol. 
The hourlong session between Cheney and more than 40 of the state's 52 House 
members and two senators amounted to little more than a reiteration of 
previously expressed positions. 
Democrats generally support price caps, while Republicans fear that limits 
could worsen the power shortage. 
Cheney was not immediately available after the meeting. 
"Price caps add... not a single kilowatt to the electrical grid in 
California," said his spokeswoman, Juleanna Glover Weiss, describing the vice 
president's message to the delegation. "In fact, they could do just the 
opposite." 
The partisan nature of the gathering and its aftermath was inescapable. 
"You'd think the president only thinks he's president of the states that 
voted for him," said Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Los Angeles. 
Rep. Anna Eshoo, D-Palo Alto, said at one point Cheney told her that she 
'"was being very rude'" by interrupting him. 
Rep. Ellen Tauscher, D-Walnut Creek, said Cheney defended the record prices 
charged by power suppliers as the workings of the free market. 
"In truth, it's a freak market," Tauscher said as she made an early exit. 
Several Democrats claimed Cheney agreed to the meeting only because 
California Republicans have been feeling increased political pressure to act 
to ease the energy crisis. 
Weiss said scheduling problems precluded a get-together before Tuesday. 







Governor plans to release details of long-term power contracts 



By Alexa Haussler
ASSOCIATED PRESS 
June 12, 2001 
SACRAMENTO ) After fighting off demands for information for months, Gov. Gray 
Davis plans to release this week the much-sought details of 38 long-term 
contracts between the state and power generators, aides said Tuesday. 
Davis now believes, senior adviser Nancy McFadden said, it's better to 
release the information than keep it secret. 
Republican lawmakers and several news organizations, including The Associated 
Press, sued Davis in March, saying his refusal to release the contracts' 
details violates the California Public Records Act. 
Still, Davis refused, saying that revealing the details would put the state 
at a competitive disadvantage in other contract talks. 
The state has bought power since January for customers of three cash-strapped 
utilities. Much of that has been on the expensive spot market, although the 
state has more long-term contracts in recent weeks. 
Davis aides also said details will be released this week about the state's 
spot market power buys in January. 
Raymond Hart, Department of Water Resources deputy director, wrote power 
generators Monday saying the department will ask a judge Wednesday to throw 
out a confidentiality provision in the contracts. 
While revealing the details still might pose some problems in negotiations, 
"those impacts are far more limited than they might have been had the 
contracts been released even two weeks ago," Hart wrote. 
Oklahoma-based Williams Energy, one of the generators with a state contract, 
opposes the release of the contract details, a spokeswoman said. 
"Information contained in those is proprietary information that allows us to 
be competitive and to bid competitively," said spokeswoman Paula 
Hall-Collins. 
Senate leader John Burton, D-San Francisco, said lawmakers need to see the 
details of the contracts before they could approve the governor's plan to 
rescue Southern California Edison, or any alternate plan. 
"Until we see those contracts, and know exactly what's in them, we can't make 
a determination," Burton said. "There was an argument that I think was valid 
that the governor made at beginning of the contracts. ... We're totally 
beyond that now." 
Burton said Tuesday he'll introduce three energy-related measures in the 
Legislature ) including one that would repeal a 10 percent rate hike 
scheduled to take effect next year. 
The 1996 electricity deregulation law included an automatic 10 percent rate 
reduction until March 2002. Burton's bill would remove that out from state 
law, but the Public Utilities Commission could still raise rates if 
commissioners felt it was needed. 
Burton is also authoring a bill to provide backup battery power for traffic 
signals in some intersections to keep the lights on during blackouts. 
Burton's third measure is a resolution that voices support for Davis to 
commandeer power plants under his emergency powers authority. 
"The governor talks about it," Burton said. "We're going to show him that 
there is support in the Senate for seizing these power plants from these 
generators who have been ripping us off." 






Power Deals Exceed Prices on Spot Market 
Crisis: State has agreed to long-term pacts at rates far higher than 
currently available. Defenders say prices are falling because the deals take 
pressure off market. 

By ROBERT J. LOPEZ and RICH CONNELL, Times Staff Writers 

?????California officials have agreed to purchase power for years to come at 
prices higher than those now being paid in the daily spot market, according 
to confidential government records.
?????The 38 long-term contracts, totaling nearly $43 billion, could saddle 
consumers with unnecessarily high utility rates for years if recently 
declining prices represent a trend in the volatile electricity market.
?????Gov. Gray Davis in recent days has largely credited these contracts with 
breaking the fever of the energy crisis. But the cooling prices--and fresh 
details of the contracts--raise concerns that the 18 energy companies may 
have gotten the better end of the deals.
?????Perhaps adding to the downward pressure on prices, senior officials of 
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said Tuesday that the agency is 
considering new ways to curb California electricity prices this summer.
?????Among other things, the commission might extend its current wholesale 
price limits--now in effect only during power emergencies--to 24 hours a day, 
seven days a week.
?????The contract records obtained by The Times show that the state is 
committed to buying power at prices up to $154 a megawatt-hour for peak 
electricity and more than $95 for energy that includes times of day when 
demand is lowest.
?????By contrast, with a recent tumble in wholesale power prices, the state 
purchased peak daytime electricity at less than $100 an hour and less than 
$20 at night when demand trails off. On Tuesday, prices for last-minute peak 
power in California were under $58 a megawatt-hour, according a Bloomberg 
news service survey.
?????In some contracts, the state may pay more or less in the years ahead, 
depending on the price of natural gas. Under terms negotiated by the Davis 
administration, one company receives $80 million to $90 million a year simply 
to be ready to produce, even if no electricity is sold.
?????The good news surrounding current market prices could change rapidly 
this summer as temperatures climb and use of air conditioning surges.
?????Nonetheless, experts say, the recent prices could be an omen of the 
future, when as many as 15 new power plants come online, adding thousands of 
megawatts to the California grid.
?????"The theme here is the governor embarked on a long-term strategy for a 
short-term crisis," said Peter Navarro, an economist at UC Irvine, who 
reviewed some of the contract terms at the request of The Times. "They pretty 
much got this exactly wrong."
?????State officials, including Davis, say they are proud of the hard-fought 
concessions they won from the power merchants, who have reaped immense 
profits from the state's failed deregulation scheme.
?????They say the benefits of the power contracts, while less predictable in 
the long term, have already helped alter the marketplace. Perhaps most 
important, they say, the contracts have freed the state from a nearly total 
reliance on last-minute purchases in the costly spot market.
?????Officials say the contracts have locked up nearly half the state's peak 
power needs this summer. The remainder will come from short-term contracts, 
last-minute purchases and reduced demand from conservation programs. "This 
was all a well thought-through plan of action," said Davis energy advisor S. 
David Freeman, former head of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. 
"The war ain't over. But we have landed on enemy territory and we are rolling 
them back."
?????Freeman seemed less confident, however, when asked whether the state may 
end up being stuck with high-priced contracts. "We hardly know the present," 
he said, "we certainly don't know the future."
?????Ray Hart, deputy director of the Department of Water Resources, said the 
state is absolutely not overpaying for power under the contracts his agency 
is helping to negotiate. He acknowledged that the average price the state is 
paying under the contracts is higher than current market prices.
?????And that is the way it should be, he said, because the state has 
dampened the volatility of the spot market by reducing last-minute purchases.
?????"If we didn't have contracts," Hart said, "we'd be buying 100% on the 
spot market . . . spending $300-plus [a megawatt-hour] for energy."
?????Many of the contract details remain shrouded in mystery, making it 
difficult to gauge the true extent of the state's financial commitment.

?????News Organizations Seek Disclosure of Deals
?????The Times and other news organizations have sued the state to release 
the contracts and provide details on the state's daily power purchases, now 
totaling more than $7 billion. The Davis administration previously refused to 
release the information, saying that it would undercut the state's efforts to 
secure additional long-term contracts.
?????But on Tuesday the governor announced that he intended to release the 
contracts as early as today "with only very minor redactions."
?????The about-face came after state Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer said publicly 
that the contracts should no longer be kept secret and preceded by a day a 
hearing before a San Diego Superior Court judge on the case brought by the 
news organizations. 
?????The administration sent letters to the 18 power producers and marketers 
that have the contracts with the state notifying them of the hearing.
?????In a letter to one firm, the administration said the San Diego hearing 
"may be the only such opportunity for your firm to indicate whether it has 
any objection to the public disclosure of the contract."
?????More than one firm is likely to object.
?????"We have always maintained that there's information in the contracts 
that's proprietary that allows us to operate competitively," said Williams 
Companies spokeswoman Paula Hall-Collins. 
?????Most of the contracts have been released under confidentiality 
agreements to federal regulators, state Controller Kathleen Connell and a 
congressional committee probing the power crisis.
?????One congressman who has studied the contracts, Doug Ose (R-Sacramento), 
criticized the governor for locking the state into "high rates for years to 
come."
?????"This sort of short-term fix," Ose said, "has squandered our [state 
budget] surplus and hampers the state treasury for the foreseeable future."
?????The records obtained The Times show that the contracts vary widely in 
cost and complexity.
?????For example, in a series of agreements for power in Southern California, 
the state has agreed to pay Dynegy Inc. some rates fixed at a $119 a 
megawatt-hour for peak power beginning next year, more than double the price 
of electricity on the spot market Tuesday.
?????Under a separate deal for the same three-year period, the Houston-based 
company has an entirely different rate structure that could minimize its risk 
of losses. The state will pay $21.65 a megawatt-hour, in addition to covering 
fuel and other production costs that could rise or fall dramatically.
?????Hart, of the state water agency, argues that California consumers could 
benefit should natural gas prices fall.
?????A pair of contracts with Constellation Energy Group illustrates the 
horse trading. 
?????In one two-year deal, the Baltimore-based company will receive $154 a 
megawatt-hour for peak power, the highest price in the records reviewed by 
The Times. The state also agreed to take a larger amount of power around the 
clock. That deal, at $58 a megawatt-hour, extends over eight years beginning 
in 2003.
?????Freeman, who helped broker many of the deals, said the state had to sign 
long-term contracts to lock in electricity needed this year and next--a 
necessary "quid pro quo."
?????Freeman said critics do not recognize the difficult negotiating position 
the state faced earlier this year.
?????Some energy insiders say the state hurt itself by waiting too long to 
begin those negotiations, when prices had soared and its largest utilities 
were buried in debt.
?????Last summer, Houston-based Enron and several other firms offered to sell 
power to California's utilities for just five years at about $50 a 
megawatt-hour, according to Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman. "Now you've got 
the state committed to 10 years of buying power at what appears to be 
significantly over market [prices]," he said.
?????Freeman blamed the Public Utilities Commission for balking at long-term 
contracts for fear that ratepayers would be stuck with overpriced energy if 
prices fell.

Federal Panel May Extend Price Limits 
Utilities: Regulatory commission weighs expanding the plan beyond emergencies 
and throughout the West. 

By RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR, Times Staff Writer 

?????WASHINGTON--The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, responding to 
pressure from lawmakers, state officials and consumers, is considering a 
significant expansion of its plan to limit California electricity prices this 
summer, senior agency officials said Tuesday.
?????Commissioners and staff members are engaged in intense negotiations in 
advance of a key meeting Monday to finalize an emergency plan for California 
and the West.
?????According to several commission officials, the options being discussed 
include:
?????* Extending FERC's current price limits--now in effect only during power 
emergencies in California--to 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The limits, 
intended to prevent price spikes, were invoked during two emergencies last 
month and resulted in immediate cuts in the price of wholesale electricity. 
FERC is also considering applying such limits throughout the West.
?????* Requiring power generators in the entire Western region to sell 
available electricity to California or into their local power grids during 
emergencies, reducing the threat of blackouts.
?????* Establishing a regional framework for large power users to sell 
electricity back into the grid during peak usage times. Some companies that 
have long-term power contracts at low rates may be able to make money by 
scaling back their operations and selling electricity.
?????* Tightening rules on what energy marketers--firms that buy and resell 
power contracts much like stockbrokers trade shares--can charge for their 
electricity.
?????* Expanding an order issued last year that authorized refunds for 
excessive markups during the most extreme power emergencies. That refund 
order would now apply to excessive prices during all power emergencies.
?????The measures under consideration stop short of the price caps being 
sought by Gov. Gray Davis and California Democrats. But they may go far 
enough to provide an acceptable compromise.
?????"The whole thing is in flux, but it is moving toward a much more 
effective price mitigation plan, not only for California but for the West," 
said an agency official.
?????Strong political pressure from Senate Democrats and House Republicans 
appears to have galvanized FERC into taking a more decisive role. "We're sort 
of the last to get it," the official said.
?????FERC has been bitterly criticized by Davis for abandoning California. 
FERC Chairman Curtis L. Hebert Jr. has responded by citing dozens of modest 
FERC actions to assist the state.
?????But Hebert has resisted Davis' central demand that FERC use its legal 
authority to order a temporary return to fixed electricity rates. Such fixed 
rates, based on the cost of producing power plus an allowance for profit, 
were standard before deregulation.
?????"The politics of the situation have changed significantly, and 
commissioners are not immune to politics," said another senior agency 
official. "The message from Capitol Hill has gotten stronger with a 
Democratic Senate. Even the Bush administration is saying we should make sure 
there is no price gouging."
?????FERC members have been summoned to testify before the Senate 
Governmental Affairs Committee chaired by Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.) 
a week from today. Meanwhile, Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.), the new Senate 
Energy Committee chairman, has told FERC he will move legislation to cap 
electricity rates in the West unless it acts soon.
?????Agency officials said commissioners do not want to face Lieberman next 
week empty-handed.
?????House Republicans have also been prodding the agency. On Tuesday, Energy 
Committee Chairman W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.) wrote Hebert to urge 
Western-wide, round-the-clock price limits.
?????"We strongly urge the commission to implement a comprehensive plan to 
mitigate wholesale prices and aggressively monitor wholesale sales of 
electric energy . . . within the entire Western Systems Coordinating 
Council," wrote Tauzin, referring to the Western power grid.
?????FERC officials said a strong effort is underway to achieve a consensus 
on the five-member commission, lately riven by ideology but now bolstered by 
two new pragmatic commissioners who favor active oversight of industry.
?????Commissioner William Massey, who for months has been a lonely dissenter, 
is continuing to press for the traditional price caps sought by Davis, 
officials said. Once marginalized, Massey apparently is now being actively 
wooed by the other members.
?????S. David Freeman, an energy advisor to Gov. Davis, said Tuesday that 
expanding FERC's current price limits would be a positive step. But he added 
that the governor continues to advocate a return to traditional, fixed rates.
?????"Any strengthening of the [FERC] plan is in the public interest," 
Freeman told reporters at a Washington news conference.
?????FERC's price limits are not keyed to a particular dollar amount but are 
flexible.
?????When a power emergency is called by the state, FERC's plan limits the 
price that generators can charge to what it costs to produce power at the 
least efficient plant running at that time. (The costs of all the plants are 
determined beforehand by California's grid operator based on data filed by 
the generators.)
?????Another requirement of the FERC plan forces generators using the 
California grid to sell any power they have available during emergency 
conditions.
?????When the price limits were tested in two emergencies late last month, 
prices came down quickly. But power sellers complained that the limits were 
too strict. And by the second emergency, there was evidence that some sellers 
had started finding ways around the limits.

Energy Execs Gain Millions in Stock Sales 
Power: Some say they have profited from the state's crisis. Others say the 
practice is standard. 

By JERRY HIRSCH, Times Staff Writer 

?????Top executives and directors at many of the large power companies that 
California officials accuse of profiteering from the energy crisis have 
collected tens and even hundreds of millions of dollars through stock sales.
?????Beginning early last year, these executives exercised options and sold 
stock for huge gains at two, three and even 10 times the level of prior 
years, according to a study by The Times of trading data supplied by First 
Call/Thomson Financial and federal regulatory filings.



Executives' Stock Deals

Click to see full graphic.


?????Most of the energy companies would not discuss specific trades by 
executives, but said that granting stock options is a standard practice used 
to compensate top managers and other key players.
?????In selling in the last year, the executives have demonstrated a knack 
for timing the transactions near the top of the market, a logical strategy, 
executive-pay experts said. Indeed, many of these companies' shares have 
fallen since the bulk of the stock sales.
?????But critics say it is the energy crisis in California and the West that 
has driven up corporate profits at these companies--including AES Corp. of 
Virginia, Duke Energy Corp. of North Carolina and Houston-based energy 
concerns Enron Corp. and El Paso Corp. The crisis created a bull market for 
publicly traded power companies--and made the shares held by the executives 
especially lucrative.
?????Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay netted $123 million in option transactions 
last year, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
That was nearly three times his gains the previous year and nearly 10 times 
what he made in 1998.
?????Lay has made additional gains this year. He has cashed in options and 
sold shares to net nearly $23 million since November, while holding on to 
50,000 additional shares with a market value of $2.5 million, according to 
First Call/Thomson Financial data.
?????Meanwhile, Jeffrey K. Skilling, Enron's chief executive, netted more 
than $62 million last year in options gains.
?????Other executives are exercising options for huge gains but then holding 
on to the shares. Roger W. Sant, chairman of AES, bought 436,500 shares in 
the Arlington, Va.-based company Oct. 26, paying $1.62 a share and producing 
a paper gain of more than $21.5 million at the time of the transaction.
?????But some also cashed out large holdings acquired over years. For 
example, Robert Hemphill Jr., a longtime AES executive who now serves on its 
board of directors, has sold $50 million of the company's stock in the last 
13 months.
?????David Arledge, a director of El Paso Corp. and former executive at a 
company acquired by the Houston natural gas firm, has sold nearly $27 million 
in stock since Nov. 1.
?????Cashing in when an industry is hot is typical of corporate executives in 
the U.S., said Graef Crystal, a Las Vegas-based expert on executive 
compensation. But when an individual's transactions approach or cross the 
hundred-million-dollar level, he said, the gains become unusual.
?????California officeholders and policymakers expressed outrage but not 
surprise at the transactions.
?????"It is part of a pattern of smart trading by these guys," said state 
Sen. Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey), who chairs the Senate Energy, Utilities 
and Communications Committee. "The mentality is to get everything that you 
can and then ride out the bust.
?????"I think they are figuring that by this time next year the party will be 
over and they will be left sitting in a room with plastic cups half-filled 
with stale beer," Bowen said.
?????Said Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities 
Commission: "It stands to reason that if the companies are making exorbitant 
profits, then the individuals who run the companies are also making 
exorbitant profits."

?????Government Agencies Investigating Firms
?????Indeed, the stock sales have taken place against a backdrop of acrimony 
between state officials and the power companies.
?????Last month, Lynch told The Times that state investigators have uncovered 
evidence that a "cartel" of power companies shut down plants for unnecessary 
maintenance to create shortages and thus increase prices and profits. Lynch 
did not name the companies.
?????State and federal agencies are investigating the actions of several of 
the big energy companies, seeking to verify charges that they have conspired 
to boost prices by limiting construction of power plants, in one case, or by 
limiting the amount of natural gas available in the power-hungry California 
market.
?????Executives at firms not accused of price gouging also have cashed in.
?????Ann B. Curtis, chief financial officer of Calpine Corp., a San 
Jose-based power plant builder and generator, has netted more than $10 
million in option transactions in the last year. That compares with a total 
of $5 million in the four previous years.
?????Some analysts say the transactions are to be expected, considering the 
changing nature of the power industry.
?????"Unlike at the old-line utilities where insiders rarely sell, we've 
grown accustomed to insider sales at the diversified power producers," said 
Paul Elliott, a First Call/Thomson Financial analyst. "I'm not convinced that 
these sales raise any red flags at this point."
?????Although no one is saying that any of the stock trades were illegal, 
critics link the value of the transactions to the profits streaming out of 
California.
?????"The generators have no shame," said Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for 
California Gov. Gray Davis. "It speaks to how there has been a massive 
transfer of wealth from California and the West to Texas and the Southeast."
?????In reporting record financial results for the first quarter of this 
year, Enron said it posted a 281% increase in revenue to $50.1 billion and a 
20% increase in net income to $406 million.
?????The company did not break out numbers for its California business but 
did note that it sold nearly twice as much electricity in North America 
compared with a year earlier, and that sales of natural gas had risen by a 
third.
?????Lay, the Enron chairman, "has given himself very generous stock options 
over the years," compensation expert Crystal said.
?????"You might think of him as a farmer who has planted thousands of acres 
of stock options. Now he is harvesting a bumper crop. What he is harvesting 
is the hard-earned paychecks of California workers and taxpayers."
?????Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman, declined to talk about executives' 
stock trading activity.
?????"All Enron employees are shareholders. How they decide to use that as a 
form of compensation is completely up to them," Palmer said. "Mr. Lay is not 
going to talk about his compensation." 
?????A spokesman for AES also declined to talk about stock sales by its 
employees.
?????Other companies were more willing to discuss such sales.
?????"Many of these people have a lot of stock, and this [is] an opportunity 
to diversify their personal portfolios at an opportune time when Duke's stock 
is up," said Terry Francisco, a spokesman for Duke Energy.
?????Francisco said many of the sellers at Duke continue to hold large 
amounts of the company's stock. That also holds true for executives of the 
other firms.
?????Calpine Chief Executive Peter Cartwright, for example, sold nearly $20 
million in his company's shares since May 2000, when wholesale electricity 
prices started rising and the state's energy crisis took root. His remaining 
holdings have a market value of more than $400 million, according to SEC 
filings.

?????'Getting Out While the Getting Is Good'?
?????El Paso spokeswoman Norma Dunn noted that Arledge, one of the largest 
sellers, was CEO of Coastal Corp., a company acquired by El Paso, and chose 
to sell some of his holdings after the merger.
?????One factor in the heavy sales of energy company shares is that 
executives at these companies may be reading the changing marketplace and 
seeing increased political pressure to rein in energy prices, analysts said.
?????"They may feel that this power game is not going to go on forever, so 
they are getting out while the getting is good," said David Moreland, a 
benefits consultant with CMG Consulting Inc. in San Jose.
?????Much of the executives' gains stem from the common practice of granting 
low-priced options to management. At Calpine, for example, both Curtis and 
Cartwright gained millions of dollars selling shares purchased from the 
company at just 7 cents and $1.07 a share and then sold for more than $40 a 
share.
?????Companies grant these options as an incentive for management to increase 
the investment value of shareholders. They provide for giant payoffs without 
the company having to fork out cash.
?????Yet there is a cost to the company, analyst Crystal said. The deals 
increase the number of shares outstanding, incrementally diminishing the 
holdings of other investors.
?????When the option tab hits tens of millions of dollars or more, the 
company is in essence handing the money to executives rather than using it to 
expand the company, Crystal said.
?????"This is not the tooth fairy," he said.

Edison Reaches Accord With Alternative Generators 


By NANCY RIVERA BROOKS and TIM REITERMAN, Times Staff Writers 

?????Southern California Edison reached an agreement Tuesday to stabilize 
prices and pay part of its debts to alternative power producers, an important 
source of electricity that could help California avoid blackouts this summer.
?????The deal, reached with key representatives of the power producers, calls 
for an end to litigation by those small companies that produce power from 
alternative sources such as wind, solar, geothermal, biomass and at gas-fired 
cogeneration facilities.
?????Edison owes those generators millions of dollars for electricity, and 33 
lawsuits have been filed against the Rosemead utility to recover debts, 
attach assets and get out of the contracts. The small generators have been 
viewed as some of Edison's most dangerous creditors because they would be 
more likely than large financial institutions to force Edison into Bankruptcy 
Court.
?????"We hope this agreement will help bring stability back to this segment 
of California's energy market," said Brian Bennett, Edison vice president of 
external affairs.
?????About 700 of the small producers generate more than one-fourth of the 
state's electricity. Rolling blackouts in March were caused in part by the 
alternative generators, many of which cut production because they weren't 
being paid by Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric.
?????The PUC ordered the utilities to begin paying the generators in late 
March, and most are again producing power.
?????Edison did not release details of the agreement, which it filed with the 
California Public Utilities Commission late Tuesday, other than to say that 
it deals with payment to the producers, pricing of power purchased from the 
generators and settlement of litigation.
?????"I hear it's a good deal," said Joe Ronan, chairman of the Independent 
Energy Producers Assn., which has been involved in the negotiations.
?????Ronan, a Calpine vice president, said he learned the deal calls for a 
multiyear contract that would pay generators $53.70 per megawatt-hour. Even 
though the prices are lower than historic highs of $200 or more for 
alternative energy, Ronan said the multiyear deals will bring much needed 
stability.
?????Gas-fired plants, he said, would be protected from volatility in the 
natural gas market because the price they receive will go up if a wholesale 
price index does.
?????The PUC is scheduled to consider a proposal for resolving the issue 
today at a special meeting.
?????An earlier proposal called for Edison and PG&E to make payments of 15% 
of the amount due to the small energy providers that demonstrate a need for 
the money to keep operating.
?????The PUC recently deferred taking action on the order because the 
commission wanted to make sure that its order was in line with a court ruling 
in PG&E's bankruptcy case and to provide added time for negotiations 
conducted by the governor's office to succeed, President Loretta Lynch said.
?????The alternative producers have been meeting recently with the utilities 
and Davis energy czar David Freeman in hopes of resolving their differences 
over past payments. But Davis spokesman Roger Salazar said late Tuesday that 
he was unaware of the settlement and noted that Freeman was in Washington on 
Tuesday.
?????"I don't know if they have done something on their own," he said.
?????PUC Commissioner Carl Wood, a key player in the controversy, said he 
heard an agreement had been reached but had not yet received the details. 
?????"I hope this will settle [the issue], and we can get everyone back 
online," he said. "We can put this piece of the [energy crisis] puzzle in the 
box."
?????Wood said most of the alternative energy providers are operating but it 
is not clear that all are operating at full capacity, which will be needed 
this summer.
?????PG&E spokesman Jon Tremayne said that the utility, which serves Northern 
and Central California, is not part of the settlement.
?????PG&E, he said, had been paying energy providers about 15 cents on the 
dollar as the utility plunged toward bankruptcy. He said the company, which 
still owes hundreds of millions to the alternative generators, was continuing 
to talk with them. "All of ours are online, except for those down for 
maintenance," he said.
?????About two dozen alternative energy providers have filed motions in 
PG&E's Chapter 11 bankruptcy case in San Francisco, generally seeking back 
payments and to be released from their contracts so they can sell power at 
higher prices on the open market.
?????The bankruptcy judge in the case recently ordered PG&E to pay at least 
20% of its past debt over the next four months to several of the energy 
producers and said the order would serve as a template for resolving the 
disputes with the other ones. He declined to release the cogenerating plants 
and other producers from their contracts with the utility.

California-Only Sales Rule Fought by Plant 


By CHRISTINE HANLEY, Times Staff Writer 

?????A month after winning final approval to restart two idle generators in 
Huntington Beach, AES Corp. is fighting a requirement that it sell all the 
electricity from the units within California, arguing that such a condition 
violates interstate commerce laws.
?????AES also asks that the California-only restriction be withdrawn because 
it obstructs the company's continuing efforts to forge a contract with the 
state Department of Water Resources, the agency brokering power deals.
?????"AES believes that this condition was and is based upon errors of law 
and fact," the power giant said in a petition filed Monday with the 
California Energy Commission.
?????AES spokesman Aaron Thomas said Tuesday that the two sides are very 
close to a deal and that the petition is only a precaution should 
negotiations fail.
?????"It's only if we can't get the agreement over the goal line," he said 
without elaborating on the sticking points. 
?????The sales condition, unprecedented in the state, was considered a deal 
maker as state officials sought a balance between California's energy needs 
and concerns of community activists and officials in Huntington Beach.
?????Local leaders expressed disappointment but not surprise that AES would 
try to find a way out of selling the power only to the state.
?????"They want to make as much money as they can," City Councilwoman Debbie 
Cook said. "We wish they would become part of our community rather than 
fighting us."
?????Negotiations between AES and the state agency began in March and 
intensified after the Energy Commission, in granting a fast-track 
construction permit May 11, limited operation of the two units to 10 years 
and ruled that their combined 450 megawatts must be sold within California. 
The 40-year-old units, to reopen in August, will generate 10% of the 5,000 
megawatts the state hopes to bring into service this summer to avert an 
electricity shortage.

Power kingpins rake in millions in stock deals 
Capital gains enriched 76 insiders, records show 
Scott Winokur, Christian Berthelsen, Chronicle Staff Writers
Wednesday, June 13, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle 
URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/06/13/MN115119.DTL 
As California's energy problems spiraled out of control over the past year, 
76 top power-com_pany officials reaped a staggering $298.34 million in 
capital gains on stock deals, a Chronicle review of public records shows. 
Among the big winners were 19 officials at Enron Corp. of Houston, which is 
headed by Kenneth Lay, an unofficial energy adviser to the Bush 
administration. 
Enron insiders netted $127.33 million, according to the analysis, which 
reviewed records of securities transactions between May 2000, when the 
state's energy crisis began, and the end of April 2001. Lay, the company 
chairman, got more than a fifth of his firm's total capital gain, $27.19 
million. 
As defined by federal law, an insider is an officer or director of a publicly 
held company or a person or entity that owns at least 10 percent of a 
particular class of its shares. Insider trades are not illegal. 
Loretta Lynch, chairwoman of the state Public Utilities Commission, said she 
deplored the personal windfalls found in The Chronicle analysis because she 
believed the profits behind them "come on the backs of California families 
and businesses." 
She said the analysis made it clear that officials had been handsomely 
rewarded "for executing a strategy that allows them to game our rules," a 
reference to state regulators' contention that power companies engage in 
illegal market manipulation. The companies deny the allegation. 
Besides Enron, firms whose executives and directors profited from insider 
trading include: 
-- The AES Corp. of Arlington, Va., where 23 insiders netted $88.17 million 
between June 2000 and April 2001; 
-- The Calpine Corp. of San Jose, where four insiders netted $46.39 million 
between May 2000 and early March 2001; 
-- Dynegy Inc., of Houston, where 13 insiders netted $21.38 million between 
May 2000 and April 2001. 
Other companies in the California energy market with insiders who fared well 
were: 
The Duke Energy Corp. of Charlotte, N.C., where nine netted $7.81 million 
between May 2000 and February 2001; The Williams Companies Inc., of Tulsa, 
Okla., where six netted $5.36 million between mid-June 2000 and March 2001; 
and Reliant Energy Inc., of Houston, whose president, Joe Bob Perkins, and 
chief financial officer, Mary Ricciardello, netted $1.9 million on April 5, 
18 and 19. 
In all, The Chronicle analysis focused on executives and directors of power 
companies selling more than 40 percent of the electricity consumed in 
California. The insiders averaged $4 million each in capital gains. 
"This puts a human face on the extent to which Californians have been 
robbed," said San Diego consumer activist Michael Shames. "We have the 
makings of a new breed of megawatt mogul becoming wealthy at California's 
expense." 
Nettie Hoge, who heads The Utility Reform Network, a San Francisco-based 
watchdog group, said she was "astounded" by what she considered the lack of 
"shame, circumspection and conscience." 
"Put this against homeless who say energy costs put them over the edge and we 
have a very stark picture," Hoge said. 
The insider trades were documented by the Securities and Exchange Commission 
and posted electronically by private financial information gatherers. All 
involved the exercise of options allowing the companies' officers and 
directors to buy stock in their own firms at huge discounts, pennies per 
share in some cases. If an option is exercised but the shares acquired 
through it are not sold, the gain commonly is considered to be an unrealized 
"paper gain." The $298.34 million collected by the insiders includes both 
paper gains and actual cash gains, which are collectively considered capital 
gains. 
Gary Ackerman, head of the Menlo Park-based Western Power Trading Forum, 
whose membership includes the companies in The Chronicle analysis, staunchly 
defended the insider activity, noting that the energy firms make money in 
other ways than selling electricity in California. 
In any case, Ackerman said, the insider activity was "allowable" under law, 
and nothing about it was "wrong or immoral." 
However, Ackerman acknowledged, the numbers could be an embarrassment. 
"I'm sure they wouldn't want it out, nor would anybody at this time, when 
people are so upset and so angry about the way things are going in 
California, " Ackerman said. 
Calpine spokesman Bill Highlander said the industry and its leaders had 
nothing to defend. 
"It's all public information. The purpose of American business is to make 
money," Highlander said. "For those companies that take risk and are 
successful, the people who run it and work for it should share in that 
success. 
I don't think you'd find it different in any other industry." 
Aaron Thomas, a spokesman for AES, said there was "no connection" between his 
company's record in California and its executives' decisions to exercise 
their stock options. 
Terry Francisco, a spokesman for Duke, said company policy prohibited him 
from discussing the exercise of options by specific individuals. But he said 
such insider trades would be smart moves for executives whose overall 
compensation is tied closely to the company's stock price -- particularly 
when that price has appreciated 50 percent in a single year, as Duke's has. 
Enron spokesmen did not return calls. 
The one exception among the eight power companies in The Chronicle analysis 
was the Mirant Corp. of Atlanta, which has a major presence in the Bay Area. 
Ten Mirant insiders lost nearly $14,000 in transactions on March 28 and on 
the last two trading days in April, the 27th and 30th. 
SOARING ENERGY PRICES
At the same time the energy companies' officers and directors were exercising 
options, the prices their companies charged California utilities soared, 
bankrupting the giant Pacific Gas and Electric Co., threatening to sink 
Southern California Edison and prompting state regulators to lift a longtime 
cap on electric rates paid by consumers. 
The price of a megawatt hour of electricity -- enough to power 1,000 homes 
simultaneously for an hour -- rose 289 percent in 2000 over 1999 in 
California's markets where power is purchased a day-ahead or an hour-ahead. 
It went from an average of $28.34 to $110.51. In December alone, average 
prices rose twelvefold, from $31.88 to $425.59. 
Prices in the real-time spot market run by the California Independent System 
Operator were much higher. Duke has acknowledged charging nearly $3,900 per 
megawatt hour for power sold earlier this year, and Reliant Energy charges 
reached $1,900 at one point. 
The ISO on June 8 increased to half a dozen the number of power companies it 
has formally accused of market manipulation in a complaint before the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission. The ISO estimates that the six firms -- all 
those in The Chronicle analysis except Calpine and Enron -- overcharged the 
state $6.7 billion. 
While the companies decline to say how much of their success is attributable 
to California, a review of their data shows that they have moved far afield 
from their home states to unregulated markets, such as California's. 
As they have done this, their fortunes have improved -- in some cases over a 
period of time coinciding with the steady deepening of the state's crisis. 
NEARLY $10 MILLION IN 6 DAYS
The Chronicle analysis showed that windfalls were widespread: 
-- Between Feb. 22 and 27, Peter Cartwright, Calpine's chief executive 
officer, exercised his right to buy 215,000 shares at prices ranging from 
seven cents to $1.07 per share, for a total outlay of $179,800. During 
exactly the same period, Cartwright sold 215,000 shares at prices ranging 
from $42.34 to $46.40. The sales brought Cartwright $9.64 million -- a gain 
of $9.46 million. 
A week later, Cartwright netted $2.36 million on a two-day turnaround, 
cashing in on options that had cost him seven cents each. 
He had been similarly active in late 2000, turning three deals in September, 
November and December on options priced at seven cents and 13 cents. Net 
capital gain: $9.76 million. 
Cartwright wasn't the only Calpine insider to do well. Others include chief 
financial officer Ann B. Curtis and directors Susan Schwab and George 
Stathakis. In 10 transactions between November and March, Curtis, Schwab and 
Stathakis exercised more than 200,000 options at prices ranging from seven 
cents to $2.57 each. Net capital gain: $15.06 million. 
-- AES co-founder and chairman of the board Roger W. Sant, a former federal 
energy official, exercised his option rights on 693,396 shares on Oct. 26 and 
Nov. 30, at $1.62 per option, for a total outlay of $1,121,568. On Nov. 30, 
AES stock closed at $51.875 per share on the New York Stock Exchange. Sant's 
capital gain by the end of business on that date was $34.85 million. 
AES senior vice president Roger Naill and vice president Paul Stinson have 
been active insiders, too. Naill exercised 92,700 options between Aug. 3 and 
Aug. 8 at $1.62 per option. He sold the identical number of shares during the 
same period for prices ranging from $51.94 to $56.50. Naill's net realized 
capital gain: $4.8 million. 
Eight days after Naill's last trade, Stinson exercised 36,800 options for 
$5.13 each. He sold 36,800 shares the same day at $55.88, for a total of 
$2.06 million. Net realized capital gain: $1.8 million. 
-- Louis Dorey, president of Dynegy's Energy Marketing and Origination unit, 
bought 26,000 options and sold 26,000 shares between April 18 and 24, for a 
net capital gain of $1.2 million. Robert Doty Jr., senior vice president and 
chief financial officer of Dynegy, exercised 68,715 options on Oct. 4 and 
sold 40,000 shares the same day. Net gain: $1.94 million. 
-- Keith E. Bailey, chairman, president and chief executive officer of 
Williams, exercised 150,030 options on June 28 of last year, for a total 
outlay of $3.53 million. The same number of shares were worth $6 million at 
the close of trading that day. 
-- In separate transactions on Nov. 1-3, Richard Priory and Richard Osborne 
of Duke Energy, the company's chief executive and chief financial officers, 
netted $1 million each. On Feb. 21, Duke's group president of energy 
services, Harvey Padewer netted $2.98 million exercising nearly 300,000 
options and then selling an identical amount of stock.

Grand jury to look at energy suppliers 
Inquiry into possible price manipulation 
Greg Lucas, Sacramento Bureau Chief
Wednesday, June 13, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle 
URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/06/13/MN109452.DTL 
Sacramento -- California Attorney General Bill Lockyer said yesterday he will 
convene a criminal grand jury to investigate whether power generators 
illegally manipulated energy prices. 
Lockyer said the investigation will look into whether generators worked 
together -- directly or indirectly -- to drive up electricity and natural gas 
prices by withholding energy, shutting down plants or exploiting the bidding 
process. The investigation will begin shortly after July 1, when a new 19- 
member Sacramento County grand jury is seated. 
"This doesn't indicate we've reached a conclusion. It's a process to get at 
the truth," Lockyer said in an interview with The Chronicle. "This is the 
beginning of the criminal focus." 
Since August, Lockyer has been investigating whether generators manipulated 
the market or used unfair business practices or if their executives engaged 
in criminal behavior. 
Generators deny any manipulation of the market. They say their electricity 
prices simply reflect a lack of supply, plant breakdowns and the high cost of 
natural gas, which fuels most power plants. 
Lockyer would not say whether he has evidence of market manipulation but 
indicated that the grand jury will be an investigative tool. 
"The purpose of the effort is to make sure no stone is left unturned in our 
investigation of electrical and natural gas businesses," Lockyer said. 
Working with Lockyer, the PUC will be checking into whether generators timed 
maintenance and shutdowns to drive up prices -- a charge generators 
repeatedly deny. 
"We've had the Public Utilities Commission visit our facilities 65 times. 
They were here today for the second time in a couple of days. They've yet to 
prove manipulation or withholding because we have not manipulated and we have 
not withheld," said Pat Dorinson, a spokesman for Mirant, which operates two 
power plants in the Bay Area. 
"If they have hard evidence to the contrary, they should bring it forward," 
Dorinson said. 
Tom Williams, a spokesman for Duke Energy, laughed when he was told of the 
grand jury convening. 
He said the North Carolina-based company had been running its plants hard, at 
the state's request, and charging "below the clearinghouse price" this year 
and last year. 
"Those are two fundamental things, both on price and supply, that will be a 
fundamental component of anything we present" to an investigation, Williams 
said. 
Gov. Gray Davis talked by telephone with Lockyer Monday about the status of 
his investigation. 
Steve Maviglio, Davis' press secretary, said in a statement: "There is a 
growing body of evidence that may give the attorney general the opportunity 
to proceed with criminal as well as civil actions." 
Lockyer said he did not know how long the grand jury would investigate the 
issue. 
It takes 12 of the grand jury's 19 members to return an indictment. Each 
grand jury serves for a year. 
Lockyer's investigation is not related to one by the Senate Select Committee 
to Investigate Price Manipulation in the Wholesale Energy Market. It has 
subpoenaed documents from the state's biggest generators. 
"I don't know about criminal activity. I wouldn't put it in those terms," 
said state Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, chairman of the Senate investigative 
committee. "Has there been market power exercised in a collusive fashion? The 
answer is there is activity that is suspicious at first blush."

Santa Rita solar array starts making electricity 
Jail's system will make 500 kilowatts 
Benjamin Pimentel, Chronicle Staff Writer
Wednesday, June 13, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle 
URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/06/13/MN119107.DTL 

Alameda County's main jail has begun drawing juice from the sun as workers 
lay out what will be the largest array of rooftop solar panels anywhere in 
the Western Hemisphere. 
When the giant project is finished next month, Santa Rita County Jail in 
Dublin will resemble a power plant, with one-third of its buildings covered 
with nearly 5,000 panels with photovoltaic cells -- generating enough energy 
to power 500 homes. 
"We're producing clean, reliable power," Matt Muniz, Alameda County's energy 
program manager, said at a news briefing yesterday. "The real importance of 
this is reducing energy costs for the county." 
The jail project highlights the growing popularity of solar energy, 
particularly in sunny California in the middle of a power crisis, said Daniel 
Shugar, an executive at PowerLight Corp. of Berkeley, which is installing the 
array. 
Another big solar project is planned at the Neutrogena Corp.'s facility in 
Los Angeles, and last week PowerLight started up a huge rooftop system at the 
Tompkins County Public Library in Ithaca, N.Y., said company spokeswoman 
Susan DeVico. 
At Santa Rita, the first batch of about 4,700, 4-foot by 4-foot panels were 
switched on at the 113-acre jail last week, and they generate about 65 
kilowatts of power, Muniz said. 
The system will produce about 500 kilowatts, Muniz said, saving the county 
about $300,000 a year in energy costs. It will also help the jail deal with 
the expected rolling blackouts in the coming hot months. Santa Rita is not 
exempt from blackouts. 
Aki Nakao, director of the county's general services agency, said the sun- 
kissed community of Dublin was perfect for the $4.4 million project, which is 
being funded with the help of state grants. 
"We're in the sunny side of the county," he said. "So it made sense." 
Muniz said that of all county facilities, the jail also had the largest roof 
and is the largest user of electricity. 
Shugar said the solar array will generate the most power during hours when 
the need is greatest. 
"In Alameda County, you are blessed with a phenomenal solar resource," he 
said. "It's not just energy, but very high value energy. It's produced at a 
time of greatest need." 
High costs once prevented the widespread use of solar energy, but new 
technology has paved the way for cheaper and more efficient systems that tap 
the sun as a main source of power, he added. 
The world's largest rooftop system is in Germany, Shugar said. In the United 
States, PowerLight also built some of the largest roof-mounted solar power 
systems anywhere, including one at a commercial building in Fountain Valley 
(Orange County) that produces about 400 kilowatts of power, he said. 
In the Bay Area, the largest rooftop solar energy array can be found at the 
company's own manufacturing plant in Berkeley, Shugar said. 
Less than 1 percent of electricity generated in California came from solar 
sources in 1999, the latest year tabulated by the California Energy 
Commission. 
The vast bulk of that, more than 95 percent, came from solar thermal 
installations in deserts that heat a liquid core connected to steam 
generation. 
Still, photovoltaic production worldwide has jumped dramatically in recent 
years, led by Japan, the United States and Europe.

'Dig-it-out-burn-it-up' methods won't work 
Elizabeth Jones, Dan Jacobson
Wednesday, June 13, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle 
URL: 
http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/06/13/E
D168204.DTL 
WE ARE FACING a tough summer here in California. With rolling blackouts and 
higher electric rates, everyone agrees that we need an energy plan. 
But just what kind of plan is the question. 
The oil and gas industries, who have much to gain by the energy crisis, are 
pushing plans to increase energy supply via the same old "dig-it-out-burn-it- 
up" methods that are dirty, dangerous and won't deliver secure, affordable 
energy supply to the public. 
Unfortunately, our politicians may be listening. 
Last month, President Bush released his energy plan that calls for building 
more than 1,000 power plants; drilling on public lands; rolling back 
clean-air standards; increasing taxpayer subsidies for coal and nuclear power 
and reducing investments in efficiency and renewable energy. 
Gov. Gray Davis and the state Energy Commission have already repealed 
California's clean-air laws during Stage 3 energy emergencies, allowed gas- 
fired plants to surpass clean-air quotas as long as they sell the energy to 
the state, and approved 13 new fossil-fuel fired power plants. The governor 
also supports building more than 13 more power plants, 28 "emergency" plants 
and allowing diesel generators to run during Stage 3 alerts. 
The oil and gas industries claim that we can drill for oil, burn fossil fuels 
and generate nuclear energy in ways that don't harm the environment. 
But look at the facts: 
-- Although natural gas burns cleaner than oil or coal, fossil fuels are 
dirty no matter what, emitting pollutants that create soot and smog, which 
could aggravate asthma and other serious health effects. Already 600,000 
children in the state have asthma -- more fossil-fuel pollution could make 
this problem worse. 
-- Oil drilling has permanently altered the once-pristine area around Prudhoe 
Bay, Alaska. British Petroleum (BP) is responsible for the second- largest 
oil spill in California history and, since 1995, has paid $47 million in 
fines for pollution violations. 
-- Despite safety claims, no safe way exists to deal with nuclear waste from 
nuclear power plants. 
-- Additionally, experts estimate that U.S. oil and natural gas supplies will 
run out in 30 to 50 years. 
One might get the impression that we have no choice but to "dig it out and 
burn it up" to meet our energy needs. 
But is the dirty, old fossil-fuel path really the only solution to the energy 
crisis? 
Absolutely not. 
With abundant sunshine, windswept plains and plenty of geothermal heat, 
California is a perfect place to use renewable energy. 
The Energy Commission estimates that more than 50 percent of California's 
energy needs could be met through solar, wind and geothermal energy. The U.S. 
Department of Energy reports that 65 percent of the United States' energy 
needs could be met from tougher auto standards, conservation and renewable 
energy sources. 
For example, by making sport utility vehicles comply with current passenger 
car fuel-efficiency standards, we could save as much oil found in the Arctic 
National Wildlife Refuge. 
The state Energy Commission estimates that we currently generate less than 
half of the possible geothermal power in California. The U.S. Department of 
Energy estimates that we could generate twice as much electricity as we 
produce now from wind power. 
Renewable energy systems can be built much more quickly than fossil-fuel 
plants -- a few weeks for rooftop solar, six months to two years for wind and 
one to three years for geothermal. 
The public could get vast energy savings with more focus on energy 
efficiency. Two conservation measures that were signed by Davis this spring 
-- if implemented well -- will save enough energy to eliminate "emergency" 
diesel generators and still power roughly 2 million homes. 
This spring, the governor signed an $850 million energy conservation package 
that included rebates for consumers who buy energy-efficient appliances and 
programs to distribute energy-efficient lightbulbs. 
Unfortunately, it is now mid-June and little has been done to implement these 
programs on a large scale, despite the program's energy-saving potential. 
If we were serious about harnessing the potential of replacing 1 million 
standard lightbulbs with compact fluorescent bulbs, for example, we could 
have done any one of a number of things, including calling out the National 
Guard to distribute them within a week's time. Ten percent of California's 
energy is currently powered by renewable sources. Now, it is time to improve 
on that. State Sen. Byron Sher, D-Palo Alto, is sponsoring SB531, which would 
require that by 2010, 20 percent of California's energy come from renewable 
resources, such as wind and solar power. 
Davis should endorse Sher's bill and incorporate its elements into his energy 
plan for California. 
By doing this, he will send a strong message that he supports solutions to 
the energy crisis that protect the public health and meet our energy needs.

California governor to release details of state's power purchases

(06-13) 04:29 PDT (AP) -- 
With BC-Power-Gas Plants
SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Gov. Gray Davis is close to releasing details of 
38 long-term contracts between the state and power generators, a move that 
would end a lengthy battle over whether the agreements should remain 
confidential. 
Davis for months had refused to release information on the contracts, but his 
aides said Tuesday the disclosure was expected this week. 
The Los Angeles Times reported Wednesday that confidential government records 
show state officials agreed to contracts at prices higher than those now 
being paid in the daily spot market. 
The contracts, which total nearly $43 billion, could burden consumers with 
relatively high utility rates if the recent trend toward lower electricity 
and natural gas prices continues. 
Records obtained by the Times show the state is committed to buying power at 
prices up to $154 a megawatt-hour during peak demand periods and more than 
$95 for power at times when demand is low. In comparison, the state recently 
purchased peak power for less than $100 an hour and less than $20 an hour at 
night when demand dropped. 
The recent purchases reflect a drop in wholesale prices, which could rise 
again this summer when temperatures climb and air conditioning use surges. 
"The theme here is the governor embarked on a long-term strategy for a 
short-term crisis," Peter Navarro, an economist at University of California 
Irvine, told the Times. "They pretty much got this exactly wrong." 
State officials defended the long-term contracts, crediting the agreements 
with altering the marketplace. The contracts also have freed the state from 
its nearly total reliance on the volatile spot market. 
"This was all a well thought-through plan of action," said Davis energy 
adviser S. David Freeman, former head of the Los Angeles Department of Water 
and Power. "The war ain't over. But we have landed on enemy territory and we 
are rolling them back." 
Republican lawmakers and several news organizations, including The Associated 
Press, sued Davis in March, saying his refusal to release the contracts' 
details violated the California Public Records Act. 
Still, Davis refused, saying that revealing the details would put the state 
at a competitive disadvantage in other contract talks. 
Oklahoma-based Williams Energy, one of the generators with a state contract, 
opposes the release of the contract details. 
"Information contained in those is proprietary information that allows us to 
be competitive and to bid competitively," said spokeswoman Paula 
Hall-Collins. 
Raymond Hart, Department of Water Resources deputy director, wrote power 
generators Monday saying the department would ask a judge Wednesday to throw 
out a confidentiality provision in the contracts. 
Meanwhile, the Times also reported Wednesday that executives and board 
directors from power companies gained millions of dollars through stock sales 
last year. 
State officials accuse them of profiteering from the energy crisis, but some 
executives netted upwards of $123 million in option transactions in 2000, 
according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Stock 
prices for energy companies enjoyed robust growth last year.

Developments in California's energy crisis

944EDT0151.DTL 
(06-13) 06:57 PDT (AP) -- 
Developments in California's energy crisis: 
WEDNESDAY:
* No power alerts Wednesday as power reserves stay above 7 percent. 
TUESDAY:
* Gov. Gray Davis says he will release the much-sought details of 38 
long-term contracts between the state and power generators. Republican 
lawmakers and several news organizations, including The Associated Press, 
filed lawsuits in March saying Davis' refusal to release details of the 
state's electricity purchases violates the California Public Records Act. 
Davis has refused to release the contracts, saying that would put the state 
at a competitive disadvantage in other contract talks. He now plans to ask a 
judge to release the state from confidentiality agreements with generators so 
he can make the details public this week. 
* The governor's office says there is "a growing body of evidence that may 
give the attorney general the opportunity to proceed with criminal as well as 
civil action." The statement comes after Attorney General Bill Lockyer briefs 
the governor on the investigations into alleged price manipulation by 
generators. 
* Southern California Edison has reached an agreement with small power 
generators that could ease the bankruptcy threat the utility is facing and 
ensure Californians a critical source of power through the summer. The 
California Public Utilities Commission is expected to approve the plan 
Wednesday, requiring Edison to make partial back payments to renewable energy 
power generators, many of which have sued the utility and curtailed power 
production. The plan would raise the rates being paid to generators that use 
natural gas and offer a stable rate for five years to generators using wind, 
solar, geothermal or other renewable sources. 
* California paid a slight interest premium on a $1 billion bond sale 
Tuesday, reflecting its ongoing energy crisis and the resulting drain on the 
state's treasury. But the rate was better than some analysts had expected, 
perhaps foreshadowing a favorable reception for the $12.5 billion in bonds 
the state intends to issue later this year. Those bonds will repay the 
treasury for money California is using to buy electricity on behalf of three 
cash-strapped utilities. 
* A federal bankruptcy judge in San Francisco agrees to grant two energy 
wholesalers "safe harbor" from potential conflict of interest accusations 
while they continue trading PG&E stock. Representatives of Enron Corp. and 
Dynegy Inc. sit on the 11-member creditors committee that plays a large role 
in how PG&E's assets get divided up. Opponents of the order were concerned 
company officials might unfairly use information gleaned from that committee 
to affect trading. Morgan Guaranty, Merrill Lynch and Bank of America also 
were granted the "safe harbor" protection. 
* Shares of Edison International rose 20 cents to close at $11.20. PG&E Corp. 
closed at $12, up 50 cents. Sempra Energy, the parent company of San Diego 
Gas and Electric Co., closed at $27.20, up 48 cents. 
* Senate Leader John Burton, D-San Francisco, is introducing three 
energy-related measures, including a bill that would repeal a 10 percent rate 
hike scheduled to take effect next year. The 1996 electricity deregulation 
law included an automatic 10 percent rate reduction until March 2002. 
Burton's bill would remove that from state law, but the Public Utilities 
Commission could still raise rates if commissioners felt it was needed. 
Burton is also writing a bill to provide backup battery power for traffic 
signals in some intersections to keep the lights on during blackouts. His 
third measure is a resolution that voices support for Davis to commandeer 
power plants under his emergency powers authority. 
* Taco Bell Corp. fielded so many complaints about its energy surcharge that 
it scrubbed the fees after just two days. The fast food chain on Friday 
started adding between 10 cents and 15 cents to customer tabs at selected 
Southern California restaurants to offset power cost increases. 
* No power alerts Tuesday as power reserves stay above 7 percent. 
WHAT'S NEXT:
* Davis asks a San Diego Superior Court judge Wednesday to release the state 
from its confidentiality agreement with generators so the governor can 
release details of its long-term contracts. The same judge is also scheduled 
to hear arguments from Assembly Republicans and several news organizations, 
including The Associated Press, that are seeking the release of the 
contracts. 
* PUC is expected to act Wednesday on Southern California Edison's agreement 
with small power generators that could ease the bankruptcy threat the utility 
is facing and ensure Californians a critical source of power through the 
summer. 
* Davis' representatives continue negotiating with Sempra, the parent company 
of San Diego Gas and Electric Co., to buy the utility's transmission lines. 
* The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, chaired by U.S. Sen. Joseph 
Lieberman, D-Conn., holds hearings Thursday and June 20 on the power crisis. 
THE PROBLEM:
High demand, high wholesale energy costs, transmission glitches and a tight 
supply worsened by scarce hydroelectric power in the Northwest and 
maintenance at aging California power plants are all factors in California's 
electricity crisis. 
Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric say they've lost 
nearly $14 billion since June to high wholesale prices the state's 
electricity deregulation law bars them from passing on to consumers. PG&E, 
saying it hasn't received the help it needs from regulators or state 
lawmakers, filed for federal bankruptcy protection April 6. 
Electricity and natural gas suppliers, scared off by the companies' poor 
credit ratings, are refusing to sell to them, leading the state in January to 
start buying power for the utilities' nearly 9 million residential and 
business customers. The state is also buying power for a third investor-owned 
utility, San Diego Gas & Electric, which is in better financial shape than 
much larger Edison and PG&E but also struggling with high wholesale power 
costs. 
The Public Utilities Commission has approved average rate increases of 37 
percent for the heaviest residential customers and 38 percent for commercial 
customers, and hikes of up to 49 percent for industrial customers and 15 
percent or 20 percent for agricultural customers to help finance the state's 
multibillion-dollar power buys.

Burton bills on stoplights, price hike Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, 
D-San Francisco, introduced two energy bills. One would pay for back-up 
batteries at key intersections so they could continue operating in a 
blackout; the other would order the Public Utilities Commission not to 
automatically raise rates 10 percent next March, as part of the original 
deregulation law approved in 1996. 
Burton also introduced a resolution saying the state Senate supports Gov. 
Gray Davis seizing energy plants under his emergency powers authority. Davis 
has threatened in the past to do so but now says such action could cost the 
state expensive legal fees. The resolution is unlikely to sway the Democratic 
governor. 
Alternative generators, 
Edison reach accord 
Southern California Edison Co. said it reached an agreement with alternative 
power generators that could give California a critical source of energy this 
summer and ease the bankruptcy threat the utility is facing. The utility 
agreed to make partial back payments to the generators, many of which have 
sued the utility and curtailed power production. The California Public 
Utilities Commission is expected to approve the plan today. 
Hearings set on plan 
to bail out Edison 
The state Senate scheduled a series of hearings, beginning next week, on the 
governor's deal to bail out Southern California Edison. 
Judge allows trading 
by PG&E's creditors 
Stipulating that the companies involved must set up procedures to guard 
against misuse of confidential information, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis 
Montali yesterday allowed members of PG&E's creditors' committee to trade in 
the utility's securities without risking their debt claims. Montali also said 
he would probably allow a larger group of committee members, including Enron 
Corp. and Dynergy, to make energy deals that could have an impact on PG&E. 
The city of San Francisco, which has sued Enron, Dynergy and other energy 
dealers, claims the trading would invite conflicts of interest.

Edison reaches deal with small generators 
GARY GENTILE, AP Business Writer

(06-13) 00:03 PDT LOS ANGELES (AP) -- 
Cleaner-burning sources of electricity that were often unavailable earlier 
this year because of money problems would be secure under a proposal the 
Public Utilities Commission is expected to discuss Wednesday. 
If the commission endorses an agreement between Southern California Edison 
and small power generators, it also could help the utility avoid bankruptcy. 
The deal is meant to ensure that the small generators, or "qualifying 
facilities," keep operating. 
Several rolling blackouts in January were triggered, in part, by the 
unavailability of power generated by the qualifying facilities, which were 
strapped for cash because they hadn't been paid by Edison and Pacific Gas & 
Electric Co. The small generators, many of which have sued the utility, 
account for about one-third of the state's power supply. 
The proposed PUC order would raise the rates being paid to generators that 
use natural gas and offer a stable rate for five years to generators using 
wind, solar, geothermal or other renewable sources. 
The proposed order would also require Edison to pay at least 15 percent of 
what it owes generators. 
The PUC action is expected to reflect elements of the Edison agreement. 
The deal removes the threat of legal action against the utility if full 
payment for power bought since January is made within six months after the 
PUC order becomes final. 
"I think it's a good, balanced deal for both sides and the only issue will be 
making sure the PUC will adopt the deal," said Jerry Bloom, a spokesman for 
the California Co-generation Council, which represents many small, natural 
gas-fired power generators. 
Edison officials agreed. 
"We hope this agreement will help bring stability back to this segment of 
California's energy market," the company said in a statement. 
The small generators are owed more than $1 billion by bankrupt Pacific Gas & 
Electric and Edison. 
In March, the PUC ordered the utilities to make payments to the qualifying 
facilities for power delivered in April and beyond. Both utilities began 
making those payments in mid-April. 
According to the California Independent System Operator, which manages the 
state's power grid, many small generators have come back online since the 
beginning of May. 
The ISO said the small generators account for about 5,800 megawatts of 
potential power. At times earlier in the year, as much as 3,000 megawatts 
have been unavailable to the state. Since May, that number has decreased to 
about 400 megawatts, or what would normally be expected because of mechanical 
problems or maintenance, according to the ISO. 
One megawatt is enough to provide power to approximately 750 homes. 
The agreement with Edison comes the same week the utility persuaded a state 
judge to consolidate about a dozen lawsuits brought against the utility by 
the qualifying facilities. 
Once a trial judge has been appointed to hear the case, Edison intends to ask 
that another 15 or 16 other lawsuits be added, according to Barbara Reeves, 
Edison assistant general counsel. The cases remain on hold until then, she 
said. 
If the PUC acts Wednesday on the Edison deal, those cases could disappear. 
Bloom said that if the PUC decision is not appealed, generators have agreed 
to put their lawsuits on hold for 180 days. 
"If they pay back what they owe us, the lawsuits would be dismissed and the 
claims would be settled," Bloom said. 
Those lawsuits have been a growing source of concern for Edison, which has 
been trying to avoid filing for bankruptcy protection. 
In March, a group of qualifying facilities were one day away from filing a 
bankruptcy petition when a court allowed CalEnergy to end its contract with 
Edison and sell power on the open market. The victory triggered similar suits 
by other generators and attempts by several to attach Edison's assets. 
In May, the City of Long Beach, which sold energy it produced from a trash 
facility to Edison, won an attachment of Edison's bank account in the amount 
of $4.9 million plus interest. The company is appealing the decision. 
Edison is also hoping the sale of $1.2 billion in bonds issued by a newly 
created holding company will keep creditors at bay. 
The utility said Tuesday it will sell the bonds in a private placement. The 
bonds will be issued by Mission Energy Holding Company, a new entity created 
to shield Edison International from financial turmoil experienced by its 
subsidiaries.

Governor set to reveal terms of power deals 
Court must decide confidentiality issue

N156901.DTL 
Sacramento -- Gov. Gray Davis reversed course yesterday on the secrecy of 
long-term energy contracts, saying he now wants to make public details of the 
deals the state has signed with electricity generators. 
Davis and his advisers said they have signed enough contracts that releasing 
the information will not seriously jeopardize the state's bargaining 
position. Administration officials, however, said the contracts contain 
confidentiality clauses and they will ask a judge today to release the state 
from those provisions. 
Republican lawmakers and several media organizations, including The 
Chronicle, have filed suit against Davis, demanding that the contracts be 
made public. 
"We now believe that the balance tips in favor of disclosure rather than 
continuing to withhold the contracts," said Davis senior adviser Nancy 
McFadden. 
In San Francisco yesterday, Davis said he always intended to release the 
information six months after the contracts were signed. 
"Obviously, the market conditions are a little more favorable now," he said. 
"On balance, we think it's the appropriate time to release the information." 
Davis' request will be heard at a court hearing today in San Diego on the 
suits filed by the media and GOP lawmakers against Davis. 
But it is unclear whether the judge will go along with the administration's 
request or how the Davis administration will be able to proceed if it is 
denied. 
Paula Hall-Collins, a spokeswoman for Williams Co., said the energy company 
will monitor the court hearing. 
"We maintain that the contracts contain proprietary information," she said. 
Patrick Dorinson, a spokesman for Mirant, also expressed concern about what 
information might be released. 
"We think it is important for the people of California to have information on 
revenue and capacity information, but we are sensitive to specific terms 
being released that could be misused by our competitors in the marketplace," 
he said. 
The state has been purchasing power since Jan. 17. While much of that has 
been on the expensive spot market, state officials have also locked in 38 
contracts for long-term deals. 
However, no information on the terms of the contracts or how much the state 
is committed to spend has been released. 
Ray Hart, Department of Water Resources deputy director, sent letters to 
power generators yesterday saying the department will ask a judge to throw 
out the confidentiality provision in the contracts. 
The letter states that there will be some redactions on information that is 
considered proprietary. 
McFadden said the move was not made because the state was concerned about 
losing its lawsuits. 
She said she expected the court to release the state from the confidentiality 
agreement. The governor's office then would release the documents as early as 
this week, she said. 
Lawmakers also have been demanding the release of the information so that 
they can proceed on a plan to keep Southern California Edison out of 
bankruptcy. 
If the judge refuses to release the state from the confidentiality clause, 
the administration will negotiate with the generators individually to allow 
the contracts to be made public, McFadden said. 
But Terry Francke, general counsel with the California First Amendment 
Coalition, said he would be surprised if a judge allowed the request. 
"I don't believe the court would simply absolve a party from a contractual 
agreement at a proceeding where the other party is not present," he said. 
Francke also questioned whether the state had the right to sign contracts 
containing a confidentiality clause. 
"There is a very serious question as to whether the state of California can 
legally in effect promise to ignore the Public Records Act," he said. 
Roger Myers, an attorney for The Chronicle, said there is good case law in 
the state supporting the releasing of the information. 
"You can't enter into an agreement and convert public information into 
confidential information," he said.

Senate to probe Western energy problems 
H. JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer
Wednesday, June 13, 2001

(06-13) 01:15 PDT WASHINGTON (AP) -- 
For the first time since gaining control of the Senate, congressional 
Democrats are challenging the government's handling of the Western power 
crisis as they step up pressure on regulators to take new steps to curb 
alleged price gouging. 
The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee was to question energy economists 
at a hearing Wednesday as part of an investigation into whether a small group 
of power producers and marketers may have manipulated the electricity markets 
to make huge profits. 
The committee's chairman, Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., said the panel also 
plans to examine why the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), which 
has jurisdiction over wholesale electricity rates, has not moved more 
aggressively to monitor California's electricity deregulation plan and the 
wholesale power markets. 
Meanwhile, congressional pressure is mounting -- from both Democrats and 
Republicans -- on FERC to take additional steps aimed at reducing Western 
electricity costs, especially in California. This year California has paid 
nearly $50 billion for power, compared to $7 billion during all of 1999. 
This week wholesale electricity prices on the spot market in California fell 
to below $100 a megawatt-hour for the first time this year -- about a third 
of what they have been in recent months -- and natural gas prices also eased. 
But prices were still much higher than before the region's power problems 
began and there was fear they would rebound if shortages occur. 
A megawatt is enough to serve about 600 homes. Two years ago the average 
price of power in California was $30 a megawatt-hour. 
FERC, which regulates wholesale electricity transactions and natural gas 
transport, has stepped up its activities in recent weeks and plans a special 
meeting next Monday on California's power markets to decide what further 
steps might be needed. 
In a meeting Tuesday with more than three dozen Republican and Democratic 
lawmakers from California, Vice President Dick Cheney said the administration 
remains opposed "to any type of price control legislation," according to 
those present. 
But it also became clear that political support was growing in Congress for a 
call for more aggressive actions by the five-member energy regulatory agency, 
which is comprised of three Republicans and two Democrats. 
Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., who became chairman of the Energy and Natural 
Resources Committee when Democrats assumed the Senate majority, warned that 
price cap legislation would brought up for a Senate vote if FERC doesn't take 
additional steps to ensure prices are just and reasonable. 
"I hope that FERC will act more aggressively," Bingaman said during an energy 
forum Tuesday, "and we will not have to have legislation." Still, he said, he 
was prepared to move a bill out of his committee before the July 4 recess to 
require FERC to impose electricity price caps based on cost of production and 
a reasonable profit. 
Republicans also have begun pressuring FERC amid growing fear among some 
House GOP members about the potential political fallout in the 2002 elections 
if high Western electricity costs are not contained. 
In a letter to FERC Chairman Curtis Hebert on Tuesday, Rep. Billy Tauzin, 
R-La., chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, and 14 other GOP 
lawmakers urged FERC to expand the limited price mitigation program it 
approved in April. 
"The commission can and should do more to mitigate wholesale electricity 
prices in Western markets," urged the GOP lawmakers, calling on FERC to 
"ensure that rates ... are just and reasonable" throughout the 11 Western 
states. 
In April, FERC directed that wholesale electricity prices be limited in 
California whenever power reserves fall below 7.5 percent, triggering an 
emergency. California officials have called the limits, pegged to the cost of 
producing power from the most inefficient plant, inadequate and full of 
loopholes. 
The letter to FERC calls for the same mitigation program to be broadened to 
include all power transactions, not only those during emergencies, and for 
the limits to be expanded to include other Western states.

Expanded power price caps studied 
Posted at 10:54 p.m. PDT Tuesday, June 12, 2001 
BY JOHN WOOLFOLK AND JIM PUZZANGHERA 

Mercury News 


Under mounting criticism to ease California's power woes, federal regulators 
next week are expected to consider a major expansion of their limited price 
controls, applying them around the clock and throughout the West. 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) will meet Monday to 
reconsider its position on California, and an agency official confirmed that 
the proposal to broaden the controls is on the table. 
``The worm has turned politically,'' said the commission official, who spoke 
on condition of anonymity, adding that ``we're moving toward 24-7 in 
California'' and the Western region. 
The proposal, supported by some Republican lawmakers, stops short of the 
price cap that state Democratic leaders have been pushing for. State 
officials were encouraged by the talks but remained skeptical. 
``If they're finally for price relief, hallelujah,'' said Roger Salazar, 
spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis. ``But the devil's in the details.'' 
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., who has sponsored legislation to force the 
commission to enact temporary price caps based on production costs, also 
expressed doubts about expanding existing measures. 
``This sounds good on the face of it, and it may well be,'' Feinstein said. 
``However, this situation is ripe for manipulation.'' 
The federal commission, charged with ensuring just and reasonable wholesale 
power prices, has drawn widespread criticism from Western officials who say 
it has fallen down on the job and allowed electricity prices to soar. 
In April, the commission rejected pleas for a Western price cap and instead 
approved limited ``mitigation measures'' for California that apply only 
during power shortages. 
Those measures, which took effect May 29, base prices on the production costs 
of the least efficient, and therefore most expensive, power plant in 
operation. Critics worry that this system still allows most generators to 
profit excessively. 
Political shift 
Supporters say there's already evidence the measures are working, noting that 
power prices in California have plummeted in recent weeks. 
But critics say that the recent price drop is likely to prove temporary and 
that the approved measures will encourage power sales out of state. 
Since the April order, the political landscape has shifted. The commission's 
Republican chairman, Curt Hebert, a free-market advocate who opposes price 
caps, may lose his post to one of two new appointees to the panel who have 
hinted at more flexibility. 
In addition, Democrats, who generally favor price caps, have taken control of 
the U.S. Senate, and support is building among Republicans for tougher 
controls. 
The idea of extending the commission's April order around the clock and 
throughout the West has been floating around Washington for weeks. Rep. Doug 
Ose, R-Woodland, introduced legislation May 23 to do that, but it was 
dismissed by Gov. Gray Davis as ``inadequate.'' 
Nonetheless, Ose and 14 other Republicans, including House Energy and 
Commerce Committee Chairman Billy Tauzin, R-La., wrote to FERC chairman Curt 
Hebert on Tuesday urging him to expand the order. 
``To ensure that prices are just and reasonable during the critical months 
ahead, we believe the commission can and should do more to mitigate wholesale 
electricity prices in western markets,'' the letter said. 
Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., the new chairman of the Senate Governmental 
Affairs Committee, will hold a hearing next Wednesday on whether the 
commission has fulfilled its legal responsibility to ensure just and 
reasonable electricity rates. All five commissioners and Davis will testify. 
David Freeman, Davis' chief energy adviser, said that an expansion of FERC's 
April order would help but that more would still need to be done. 
``Any strengthening of any plan is in the public interest,'' Freeman said. 
``But it is not a substitute for what Gov. Davis is proposing.'' 
It was unclear Tuesday how far talks at the commission were progressing. 
Commissioner Linda Key Breathitt said she had not had discussions with other 
commissioners. She said she expected discussions to heat up this week as the 
commission prepares for Monday's meeting. 
But the Los Angeles Times on Tuesday quoted two unidentified commission 
sources as saying expanded controls would be considered. 
The commissioners' consideration of broader price controls comes as Vice 
President Dick Cheney dismissed price cap pleas from congressional Democrats. 
``He didn't give an inch,'' said Rep. Anna Eshoo, D-Palo Alto, a supporter of 
price caps, after the hourlong meeting. 
``If Californians are looking to this administration in the short term to be 
any kind of partner with us, to stand with the California energy consumer, I 
think today's meeting dashed that hope.'' 
Cheney listens 
Cheney repeated the administration's argument that they would not produce 
more power for the state and would only discourage producers from selling to 
the region. 
Tuesday's meeting was the first on this issue to include Democrats. 
``The vice president listened to countless questions and suggestions, and he 
did point out that the administration was not inclined toward price caps,'' 
said Cheney's spokeswoman, Juleanna Glover Weiss. 
``But the vice president did encourage every member there to continue to come 
up with any ideas that they'd like to run by the administration as we are 
looking to help in any way we can.'' 
Feinstein said expanding existing measures may allow the administration to 
help California without appearing to give in to demands for a ``cap.'' 
``Price mitigation appears to be a way to avoid using the words `price 
cap,'?'' Feinstein said. ``Frankly, I don't care what they call it, as long 
as they get the job done.''

Electricity, ethanol . . . maybe there is a plot against us 
Published Wednesday, June 13, 2001, in the San Jose Mercury News 
YOU can't blame California for starting to feel a little paranoid. 
Ask the Bush administration for help on electricity prices and you get a 
lecture on the evils of intervention in free markets. 
Ask for relief from federal rules that require unnecessary additives in 
gasoline at extra cost, and you get ethanol force fed into your car's tank. 
The Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday denied California's request 
for an exemption from a clean air rule that requires an oxygenate in 
gasoline. The ruling means California either has to start putting ethanol in 
gasoline, or it must revert to MTBE. It is phasing out MTBE by 2003 because 
the additive spreads rapidly in ground and water when gasoline spills or 
leaks. 
The ethanol requirement will raise gasoline prices an estimated 6 cents a 
gallon, assuming there is enough ethanol to avoid shortages that would drive 
prices even higher. 
For ethanol to displace MTBE in California would require production of an 
additional 580 million gallons a year, a 25 percent increase in current 
national output. The ethanol industry says it will be ready and able to meet 
the demand. Let's hope so. 
State environmental officials are adamant that neither ethanol nor MTBE is 
necessary for so-called clean gasoline, and that ethanol would actually 
create slightly more air pollution. 
As so often is the case with ethanol, economics and science had to take a 
back seat. 
Most ethanol is distilled from corn, which means that in the Midwest it is 
regarded with the same reverence as wine in the Napa Valley. Any federal 
regulation that creates a huge market for ethanol, as the EPA ruling will do 
in California, has a political bulldozer pushing it. 
California could try to get Congress to grant the oxygenate waiver, but the 
usual political calculus doesn't apply. This issue isn't partisan, it's 
regional. Any end run around the Bush administration will smack up against 
the new majority leader in the Senate, South Dakota Democrat Tom Daschle. 
Daschle teamed with then-Sen. Bob Dole, a Kansas Republican, to write the 
original rule. The whole California congressional delegration, on the other 
hand, supported the waiver. 
States in the Northeast had been delaying their own request for a waiver 
while waiting to see what happened to California. They'll drop it now. 
Winston Hickox, head of California's Environmental Protection Agency, said he 
is not against ethanol, he's just against California's being required to use 
it, since there are other ways to make clean gasoline. 
California wasn't seeking permission to let the air get dirtier. No state 
works harder for cleaner air than California. What California wanted was 
flexibility. What it got was a lesson in politics.

















Well, Texas does hate California 
Published Wednesday, June 13, 2001, in the San Jose Mercury News 
BY JAN JARBOE RUSSELL 
IN THE current undeclared war between California and Texas, Californians have 
good reason to fear President Bush and his many wealthy friends in the Texas 
oil patch. 
I read that Garry South, a strategist for California Gov. Gray Davis, had 
savaged Bush for not taking meaningful steps to help resolve California's 
alarming energy crisis. ``Texas ain't exactly Shangri-La,'' South said. 
No one who lives in Texas, as I have for most of my life, would ever mistake 
Texas for Shangri-La. Texans, however, do believe that California is 
Shangri-La. And that's precisely the problem. Texans hate Shangri-La. That's 
the subtext of the message that Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney have been 
sending to California. 
That deregulation scheme of yours? ``Harebrained,'' as a smirking Cheney 
described it on CNN. 
Think you guys in California can conserve your way out of your energy 
problems? Read my lips, Bush II in effect told California when he unveiled 
his national energy policy: Drill more wells. Build more power plants. Eat 
less granola. 
Want to know why else California has every reason to fear Texas? Here are 
three: 
First, our greatest fear in Texas is not earthquakes. Here, cheap oil 
qualifies as a true natural disaster. 
Historically, our livelihood in Texas has depended on whatever people could 
take out of the ground -- this means oil, natural gas, sulfur and uranium. 
This dependence has put Texas at significant odds with the rest of the 
country. 
Remember the last energy crisis when Jimmy Carter was president and the 
entire East Coast feared the kinds of blackouts that California now fears? 
There was so little compassion for our countrymen back then that all over 
Texas, bumper stickers appeared that said: ``Freeze a Yankee in the Dark.'' 
The point is that when Bush says he's a compassionate conservative, you have 
to keep in mind that in Midland -- Bush's hometown of choice -- compassion is 
a relative term. It means that Bush II is too nice a guy to tell Californians 
to ``Rot In the Sun,'' but he's not so compassionate that he would do 
something truly useful -- such as limiting the price of electricity to 
forestall summer blackouts. 
Second, Californians should fear Bush and his merry band of Texans because in 
Texas there is no concept whatsoever of the idea of ``public'' land, and very 
little concept of the ``public good.'' 
When Texas entered the nation, it did so as a sovereign nation, not a state. 
What that meant is that Texas got to keep title to all the land that wasn't 
in private hands. The federal government got nothing. The state kept it all. 
And the state sold most of it as quickly as it could to private owners who 
put fences around it and built vast oil and ranching empires. 
The federal government got almost none of Texas land. What the government has 
acquired in modern times -- a national park here and there, a few military 
bases -- it has paid good money for. 
Despite Hollywood's best efforts to portray Texas as a mythic land of 
romance, Texans have a very unromantic, realistic view of land. Land is to be 
used for making money. Bring in the railroads. Plow the plains. Round up the 
cattle, and -- above all -- drill for oil so that you don't have to stumble 
around in the dark, like those fuzzy-headed people in California. 
It's difficult to exaggerate just how much importance Texans place on private 
ownership of property. Property owners in Texas can do damn near anything 
they want on their own land. They can pump all of the water they want out of 
public rivers that run in front of their land. They can -- and do -- shoot 
people for trespassing. 
In Texas there is an obligation to mind your own business -- and let everyone 
else mind theirs. If your neighbor has an energy problem, the feeling is that 
your neighbor -- not the federal government -- better find a way to solve it. 
Finally, Californians should fear Texas because we sooooo envy you. 
Who wouldn't envy a state that is synonymous with a dream, where imagination 
is valued as much as realism, where people openly pursue pleasure, where 
mountains run down to the sea, and the climate is sublime all-year-round? 
Envy is the price you people in California pay for living in Shangri-La.

FERC may expand cap 
Senators say regulators are set to extend price controls throughout the West. 
June 13, 2001 
By DENA BUNIS
The Orange County Register 
WASHINGTON Federal energy regulators are poised Monday to extend limited 
price controls on the electricity market to 24 hours a day, seven days a week 
throughout the Western states, California's senators said Tuesday. 
If the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission does what Democratic Sens. 
Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein have heard it plans to do, it would 
represent a further softening by FERC in the face of mounting political 
pressure. FERC had adamantly opposed limits on a free electricity market 
until April, when it approved its first limited controls. 
Experts believe such a move could moderate wholesale prices, but to what 
extent and what the effect could be on ratepayers is uncertain. 
"It would be a step in the right direction," Boxer said Tuesday after she, 
Feinstein and 40 California House members from both parties met with Vice 
President Dick Cheney. "It still doesn't give us the kind of help with price 
gouging that we need." 
Cheney, who reiterated the administration's opposition to firm price caps, 
told members who pressed him for a California-specific solution to watch what 
FERC does at its meeting next Monday. 
Two new FERC commissioners, recently appointed by President George W. Bush, 
could be voting Monday. Energy watchers say their presence could turn FERC 
into a more activist agency. 
In April, FERC ordered a price-control plan based on a complicated formula of 
what it costs generators to produce a kilowatt of electricity. But critics, 
particularly FERC Commissioner Richard Massey, called it meaningless because 
it only applied during shortages and did not extend beyond California. 










Lower Electric Rates in West Sought 







June 13, 2001 







By H. JOSEF HEBERT
Associated Press Writer
WASHINGTON (AP) via NewsEdge Corporation - 
Federal regulators came under growing congressional pressure Tuesday to act 
further to lower the price of electricity in the West and stem alleged abuses 
by power producers. 
Democrats, who just became the Senate's majority party, planned hearings on 
Western electricity prices including a look Wednesday into the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission's handling of the power crisis. 
The FERC, which regulates wholesale electricity transactions and natural gas 
transport, has stepped up its activities in recent weeks and plans a special 
meeting next Monday on California's power markets. Regulators are expected to 
decide at that meeting whether to take additional steps to rein in prices. 
Meanwhile, political support has been growing on Capitol Hill, even among 
some Republicans, for legislation to force FERC to impose temporary price 
caps on Western power sales. 
In recent days, wholesale electricity prices have dropped significantly in 
California and the Northwest, but the threats still loom of a price rebound 
and, in California, power blackouts. 
The Bush administration remains strongly opposed to even limited price 
controls that interfere in the free market. 
Vice President Dick Cheney, in a meeting Tuesday with more than three dozen 
Republican and Democratic lawmakers from California, said the administration 
remains opposed ``to any type of price control legislation,'' according to 
lawmakers present. 
But Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., who became chairman of the Energy and Natural 
Resources Committee when Democrats assumed the Senate majority, warned FERC 
to take additional action or face legislation demanding price caps. 
``I hope that FERC will act more aggressively,'' Bingaman said during an 
energy forum, ``and we will not have to have legislation.'' 
But he said he was prepared to move a bill out of his committee before the 
July 4 recess, similar to one offered by Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., 
and Gordon Smith, R-Ore., that would require FERC to impose electricity price 
controls based on cost of production and a reasonable profit. 
At the same time, the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, chaired by Sen. 
Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., planned to hear Wednesday from several energy 
economists about FERC's handling of wholesale power markets in the West. Most 
of the witnesses, including Cornell economist Alfred Kahn, an advocate of 
electricity deregulation, have urged additional price controls under current 
circumstances. 
While most Republicans, following the White House lead, remain opposed to 
legislating price caps, there have been growing fears among GOP House members 
about potential political fallout over high Western electricity prices. 
In a letter to FERC Chairman Curtis Hebert on Tuesday, Rep. Billy Tauzin, 
R-La., chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, and 14 other GOP 
lawmakers urged FERC to be more aggressive in pursing allegations of price 
abuse and to expand the limited price mitigation program it approved in 
April. 
That order by FERC reins in wholesale electricity prices when California's 
electricity reserves fall below 7.5 percent, triggering an emergency. It 
limits prices to those charges for power from the most inefficient power 
plants. 
California Gov. Gray Davis has called the FERC limits inadequate and said 
they've had little impact on prices. Tauzin, however, cited evidence that 
FERC's order already has dampened electricity prices, which recently have 
fell significantly. 
The letter to FERC calls for the same mitigation to be broadened to include 
all power transaction, not only those during emergencies, and for the limits 
to be expanded to include other parts of the Western power grid. 
Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, chairman of a key Energy and Commerce subcommittee, 
was among those who signed the letter, but he said he opposes broader price 
controls such as those favored by most congressional Democrats. 
``There have been no instances where price caps have worked,'' insisted 
Barton at an energy forum sponsored by The Atlantic Monthly. The recent 
easing of electricity prices shows ``the market has begun to work,'' he said. 
House Minority leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., said at a news conference that 
price caps pegged to the cost of producing power are needed ``to restore 
reliable and affordable'' electricity supplies. 
``Price controls are catastrophic,'' retorted Majority Leader Dick Armey, 
R-Texas. ``If you want blackouts in California, have price controls. He and 
other Republicans say price controls inhibit electricity supplies.

In a nutshell, the ?ads charge that because the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) sold ?wholesale power outside the region while also contracting for more power than ?it generates, the agency is now forced to raise rates so high the aluminum ?industry cannot profitably operate.??It's no surprise the ads are financed by the aluminum industry. Nor is it ?surprising, BPA says, that the television spots present partial facts ?distorted to the advantage of these direct-service industries (DSI). ??"There is no legal requirement for BPA to sell power to the DSIs([rather] BPA ?is directed by statute to sell federal power to the greatest benefit of the ?widest number of people, with preference to publicly and cooperatively owned ?utilities," retorted BPA, putting its own spin on the situation. ??The fact that some aluminum companies resold their allocation of BPA's cheap ?power to the spot market at an astronomical rate this past summer, pocketing ?millions of dollars in profit for investors, has done little to provoke ?sympathy for the industry. On the other hand, the prospect of putting ?thousands of aluminum employees out of work pulls on local heartstrings. ???At the core of this war of words, however, is a much bigger issue, one that ?brings the region's low-cost hydropower into question. ??"Does the federal government have any business being in the electricity ?business in the 21st century?" asks a new report by the Northeast-Midwest ?Institute. "Is there some market distortion that requires federal ?intervention?" ??"As summer's rising temperatures increase the chances for blackouts(more eyes ?in Washington D.C. have turned to the Northwest's electric resource*the ?Columbia River hydropower system," said an editorial in The Oregonian, one of ?the major newspapers in the region. "They want the Bonneville Power ?Administration to start charging market rates for power." ??Coveting Northwest power?In accordance with its statutory mission, BPA sells its power at near-cost ?rates and gives preference to power providers in Oregon, Washington, Idaho, ?western Montana and small portions of Wyoming, Nevada, Utah, California and ?eastern Montana. According to the agency, half the power BPA sells goes to ?public utility districts, city light departments and rural electric ?cooperatives. About 15% of BPA's annual sales are to investor-owned utilities ?such as PacifiCorp, and another 25% are allocated to aluminum companies and a ?few other large industries. Once these obligations are met, surplus power can ?then be sold outside the agency's territory. ??BPA's current rate-increase controversy has its roots in the fact that the ?agency previously signed contracts to sell more power than it generates. ?Critics contend the agency engaged in overly optimistic power contracts, ?expecting a stable spot market and ample rainfall*neither of which occurred ?this year*leaving BPA unable to fulfill its contractual obligations. ??Consequently, the agency has suffered severe financial blows as it has been ?increasingly forced to buy power from the volatile spot market. To protect ?itself, BPA announced in April that without load reductions, it would be ?forced to raise wholesale rates by 200% to 300%. Last week, acting director ?Steven Wright announced that he believed the increase could be held to under ?100% due to buybacks, conservation and other aggressive attempts to reduce ?load, including a strategy that will idle the energy-intensive aluminum ?smelters to save about 1,000 average megawatts. ??This very public attempt to reduce its load has put the agency's pricing ?approach on the hot seat and has critics arguing there is no reason why BPA's ?prices should not be market-based. ??"When the federal government sells other property*everything from timber to ?used computers*it relies on the market and open auctions. That approach ?maximizes the value of the federal property to the benefit of all taxpayers," ?said the Northeast-Midwest report. ??Subsidy or geographic luck? ?BPA prices its power at the lowest it can while still recovering costs, ?including the costs of its environmental obligations, such as to endangered ?salmon in the Columbia River watershed. The Northeast-Midwest report claims ?that the differential between market wholesale prices and the agency's ?"at-cost" power rates provide a $16 billion to $34 billion benefit to the ?Pacific Northwest region. ??"BPA's low-cost power is distributed to multi-millionaires, aluminum ?companies and others who happen to live in the service territory of Northwest ?government-owned and cooperative utilities that 65 years ago were identified ?as having preference," charges the report. ???The central argument against federal agencies selling power at cost is based ?on the false premise that hydropower and the BPA are subsidized by U.S. ?taxpayers. ??Also overlooked by critics is the role the agency has come to play in the ?management of the Columbia River watershed. BPA fulfills environmental ?obligations, such as protection and enhancement of fish and wildlife, and ?provides leadership in conservation and renewables development. Equally ?significant, the Columbia River basin is located in the Pacific Northwest, ?and many argue that it is the region that should benefit first from its use, ?just as the Mississippi, for example, provides benefits for the region it ?flows through. ??"BPA and its practices persist and thrive only because few, even in the ?Northwest, are willing to invest the time and energy to understand the ?convoluted arrangement the agency and the Northwest congressional delegation ?have constructed over the years," says the report. ??But if the agency were to operate with a for-profit approach, argues BPA ?proponents, where would the profits go? If the money were used outside of the ?region, Northwest ratepayers would be subsidizing the rest of the country. If ?used inside the region, why not continue the situation as it is? ??BPA's cost-of-service pricing is a bedrock component of the region's economy ?and is unlikely to be given up without a fight. ??"The Northwest delegation must take this attack seriously and(should protect ?the region's natural resources and hydropower system," concludes The ?Oregonian.??????A Section ?No Energy Price Caps, Cheney Tells Calif.; Hill's Democrats Warn of 'Disaster'?Juliet Eilperin?? ?06/13/2001 ?The Washington Post ?FINAL ?Page A11 ?Copyright 2001, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved ?Vice President Cheney reiterated the administration's opposition to placing ?limits on electricity prices in a meeting with 40 California lawmakers ?yesterday. ?The one-hour session marked the first time a senior White House official had ?met with Democratic and Republican members to discuss the state's energy ?crisis. But the Capitol Hill meeting grew testy at times, lawmakers said, and ?highlighted how the two parties remain sharply divided on how to provide ?relief to California consumers, who face big electricity price increases and ?the possibility of higher rates this summer. ?"This is a disaster of national proportions," said Rep. Sam Farr (D-Calif.) ?in a press conference after the meeting. "We're here, in a bipartisan ?fashion, to convince the administration not to just sit back and watch ?California burn." ?Much of the meeting focused on whether the White House should encourage the ?Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to impose price caps on California ?energy producers. Cheney said such a move would not ease the state's energy ?supply problem. ?"Price caps don't produce kilowatts -- he said it over and over again," ?recalled Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.). ?Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.) -- said she drew a retort from the vice president ?when she offered, while he was speaking, that caps did not amount to price ?controls. "He said, 'You're being rude,' " said Eshoo, who said Cheney ?repeatedly looked at his watch during the meeting. ?Republicans who attended the meeting, by contrast, suggested the ?administration signaled that it was more open to providing regulatory relief ?to California .

He also promised to keep in touch with a bipartisan ?working group composed of California lawmakers. ?"In the meeting, the vice president asked the California delegation to ?continue to think about potential solutions to the energy crisis," said ?Cheney spokeswoman Juleanna Glover Weiss.
