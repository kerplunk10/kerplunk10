Kenny,

You are no friend of mine. You belong in jail. I hope that you experience 1/10 of the anguish that you have caused. I am not a vengeful man, but you have done ill by those who gave their very souls to your company, and that is inexcusable.

Matt

I had an extremely rude conversation with a manager at southwestern bell and they once again said we weren't owed anything at which time I told the woman she didn't know what the fuck she was talking about.  After several other uses of fuck she hung up.  I switched our service to att (never thought i would be happy to be an att customer again) and called back and got another manager who claims she is taking care of it.

Hey Y'all,

Less then 2 weekes before I'm back in Paradise (Texas, not Hawaii),  lookin
forward to seein all ya that I can.  Here's a little note to spread the
holiday cheer.



Subject:  Johnny Christmas Letter

Dear Santa,
You must be surprised I am writing you today, the 26th of
December. Well I would very much like to clear up certain things that have
occurred since the beginning of the month! While filled with illusions, I
wrote you a letter.  I asked for a bicycle, an electric train set, a pair of
roller blades, and a football uniform.  I destroyed my brain studying the
whole year!  Not only was I
first in my class, but I had the best grades in the whole school. I'm not
going to lie to you Santa; there was no one in the entire neighborhood that
behaved better than me. With my parents, my brothers, friends and my
neighbors, I would go on errands and even help the elderly across the
street.  There was virtually nothing I wouldn't do for humanity! WHAT BALLS
YOU HAVE LEAVING ME A FUCKING YO-YO, A STUPID ASS WHISTLE,AND A PAIR OF
SOCKS!!!What the FUCK were you THINKING, YOU FAT SON OF A BITCH!?!?!That
you've taken me for a SUCKER THE WHOLE FUCKING YEAR, to come out with some
SHIT LIKE THIS under the damn tree.  AS IF YOU HADN'T FUCKED ME ENOUGH,YOU
GAVE THAT LITTLE SHITHEAD ACROSS THE STREET SO MANY FUCKING TOYS, HECAN'T
EVEN WALK INTO HIS DAMN HOUSE! Please don't let me see you trying to fit
your BIG ASS DOWN MY CHIMNEY NEXT YEAR! I'LL FUCK YOU UP! I'll throw rocks
at those STUPID ASS REINDEERS OF YOURS, AND SCARE THEM THE FUCK AWAY, SO
YOU'LL HAVE TO WALK YOUR BIG FAT ASS EVERYWHERE, JUST LIKE I HAVE TO DO
SINCE YOU DIDN'T GIVE ME THAT FUCKING BIKE, YOU PUNK BITCH. You know what
Santa, FUCK YOU!!  Next year you'll find out HOW BAD I CAN REALLY FUCKING
BE...YOU'VE BEEN STEPPING ON THIS MOTHERFUCKER FAR TOO LONG!
SO WATCH YOUR BACK NEXT YEAR, YOU FAT BITCH!

Sincerely,
Johnny

Well if you're still there, I hope the studying is going well.  Malo means 
bad.  I feel bad because today was a big cluster fuck on the socal system.  
The reason I feel bad is Jan was out today (she usually does Socal) and 
either Ted or I was going to fill in for her.  Neither of us wanted to do it, 
and Ted got stuck with it.  Well...I would have done it, but I was out until 
2 am last night and I didn't want to fuck up because of it.  Socal can be 
high stress because there are huge time constraints and its the most 
expensive gas in the country.  Anyway, a bunch of shit got fucked up.  It's 
not Ted's fault, but he really had a rough day because of it.  I think I 
might have been able to do a better job, but I knew there was chance for 
error because neither of us have done it in a while.  I feel bad.  
Regardless, I'm pretty whipped and am looking forward to going home.  Of 
course, I have a whole weekend of work to look forward to!  

Anwyay, it looks like I'm about done here, so I have one last word for 
you..........................Adios.

that for? What was he so mad about? I can imagine that you would be scared 
seeing him act like that.  Hopefully he doesn't ever act like that or show 
that kind of temper around you.  Anyway its really none of my business i

I am available for any of those dates with very little preference which.  I

tub filled with booz, many beds with soft satin sheets, a fuck swing, a large 
(I mean really large) TV for various pleasure movies, a steam room, a maid, 
and a chef.  I also require that you keep me informed of the attending 
women.  I need to know as soon as possible whether I need to fly in my own to 
take advantage of such ammenities..  Gracious.

With love and anticipation of a memorable trip,

You will get reimbursed once you have taken the exam.  After you have done 
that you may use the education assistance form and turn it in to Randy Martin 
for reimbursement.  This can only be done after the exam has been taken.

Mike,

What's going on? I'm coming home Nov.22 for a few days. Ryan and I are going 
to go snowboarding on Friday the 24th. You should come. I am really happy 
with my car. It is a silver/black IS 300. I was suffering a little post 
purchase anxiety but I'm over it. Fuck it! You live once. Things here are 
pretty good. It helps having a couple of good friends who have been here a 
while. How are things in Calgary? I hope you have pictures from Halloween. 
Send me you address and phone #'s. I lost my old address book. I am loving 
this palm pilot. You have to get one of these things. I am going to buy a 
playstation sometime this week. Should I buy Tony Hawk 1 or 2? Better hop. 
I'll call you one night this week.

Reagan,

Charles just got a phone call for you!  Apparently, his phone number is 
listed in the directory for you.  Since I didn't remember your number, we 
told the guy we'd pass on his name and number.  His name is Ted Spackey with 
Annachem 1-800-966-1186.  

Oh, by the way, I ended up going to the Volcano last night til 12:30 and had 
a great time.  Those frozen screwdrivers will fuck you up.  I get half way in 
the door and one of the traders in my group comes running up to say.  I hung 
out with her and this other guy who's one of our brokers.  Random.  The 
broker was great to talk to because he had great things to say about Enron, 
and he wasn't kissing ass for the business because his last day is today and 
he's moving back East.  Anyway, I'm exhausted.  No partying for me tonight.

"Moths"

A man and a woman meet at bar one day and are getting along really
well. They decide to go back to the woman's house where they engage in
passionate love making.

The woman suddenly cocks her ear and says, "quick my husbandjust got
home, go hide in the bathroom!" So the man runs into the bathroom.

Her husband comes up into the bedroom and looks at her. "Why are you
naked?" he asks.

Well, I heard you pull up outside, so I thought I would come up here
and get ready to recieve you."

"Okay." the man replies "I'll go get ready."

He goes into the bathroom before his wife can stop him and sees a
naked man standing there clapping his hands.

"Who the fuck are you?" the man asks

"I am from the exterminator company, your wife called me in to get rid
of the moths you are having problems with."

The husband exclaims, "But you are naked!"

The man then looks down and jumps back in surprise.

"Those little bastards!"

this is an old one but a great one.
If you dont like this email, then you just don't understand.



A chronology of events for Saturday,  December 4, 1999,
and the early morning hours of Sunday,
December 5, 1999:
6:00 Arise, play the Eyes of Texas and
Texas Fight at
full-freaking blast
6:20 Get in car, drive to New Braunfels

7:30 Tee off (me and a buddy were the
FIRST tee-time
of the morning)
8:50 Turn 9 (crack open first beer)
8:53 Crack open second beer
8:58 Crack open...(you get the idea)
10:30 Finish 18 (holes, as well as
beers), sign
scorecard for smoooooth 95
10:35 Headed for San Antonio
10:50 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and
post-game
festivities
11:10 We decide we don't have enough
booze, so we
double-back to a liquor store and buy
the good ol' 750
ml plastic bottle "Traveler" Jim Beam
11:50 Arrive at the tailgate spot.
Awesome day. Not
a single cloud in the sky. About 70
degrees.
11:55 I decide that we're going to kick
the shit out
of Nebraska.
11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to
go fuck
himself.
12:15 The UT band walks by on the way
to the
Alamodome. We're on the second floor of
a two-story
parking garage on the corner (a couple
hundred of us).
We're hooting and hollering like
wildmen. The band
doubles back to the street right below
us and
serenades us with Texas Fight and The
Eyes of Texas.
AWESOME MOMENT.
12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity,
50-100 grown
men are bumping chests with one
another, each and
every one of them now secure and
certain of the fact
that we are going to kick the
shit out of Nebraska.
1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the
way to the
Alamodome. Again, we hoot and holler
like wildmen.
Again, the band doubles back and stops
right below us
to serenade us, this time, however,
with the Nebraska
fight songs. Although somewhat
impressed by their
spirit and verve, we remain convinced
that we are
going to kick the shit out of
Nebraska.
1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome,
somehow
managing to stuff the "Traveler" and 11
cans of beer
into my pants.
1:47 I am in line surrounded by
Nebraska fans. They
are taunting me. I am taunting back,
still certain
that we are going to kick the
shit out of Nebraska. I
decide to challenge a particularly
vocal Nebraska fan
to play what I now call and will
forever be remembered
as "Cell-Phone Flop Out." Remember flop
out for a
dollar? The rules are similar. I tell
this Nebraska
jackass that if he's so confident in
his team, he
should "flop out" his cell phone RIGHT
NOW and make
plane reservations to Phoenix for the
Fiesta Bowl.
And then I spoke these memorable words:
"And not
those
damn refundable tickets, either! You
request those
non-refundable, non-transferrable
sons-of-bitches!"
He backs down. He is unworthy. I call
Southwest
Airlines and buy two tickets to
Phoenix,
non-refundable
and non-transferrable. Price: $712. He
is humbled.
He lowers his head in shame. I raise my
cell phone in
triumph to the cheers of hundreds of
Texas fans. I am
KING and these are my subjects. I
distribute the 11
beers in my pants to the cheering
masses. I RULE the
pre-game kingdom.
2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence,
I open the
Traveler and pour my first stiffy.
2:45 I notice something troubling:
Nebraska is big.
Nebraska is fast. Nebraska is very
pissed off at
Texas.
3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends.
9 yards
total offense for Texas. Zero first
downs for Texas.
I'm still talking shit. I pour
another stiffy from
the Traveler.
3:36 Four minutes to go in the first
half: the
Traveler is a dead soldier. I buy my
first $5 beer
from the Alamodome merchants. While I
am standing in
line, a center snap nearly decapitates
Major
Applewhite
and rolls out of the end zone. Safety.
3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas
0. I wish I
had another Traveler.
4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska
fan in the
bathroom at halftime, I attempt to
revive the classic
Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:
"Hey, buddy,
niiiiiiiiice cock." He is
unamused.
4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from
the Alamodome
merchants. I share my beer with two
high school girls
sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they
are equipped
with a flask full of vodka. I send them
off to
purchase $5 Sprites, so that we may
consume their
vodka. I have not lost faith. Nebraska
is a bunch of
pussies.
4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting
behind me have
fled for their lives. I purchase two
more $5 beers
from the Alamodome merchants.
5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I
am beginning
to lose faith. This normally would
trouble me, but I
am too drunk to see the football field.

5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: "I'm
sorry, sir.
Those tickets have been confirmed and
are
non-refundable and non-transferrable."
5:37 I try to start a fight with every
person behind
the concession counter. As it turns
out, the
Alamodome has a policy that no beer can
be sold when
there is less than 10 minutes on the
game clock. I am
enraged by this policy. I ask loudly:
"Why the fuck
didn't you announce last call over the
fucking PA
system??!!"
5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in
my chair in
defeat. All of a sudden, the Texas
crowd goes
absolutely nuts. "Whazzis?," I mutter,
awaking from
my coma, "Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?"
Alas, the
answer is no, we were not winning and
we did not
score.
The largest (by far) cheer of the day
from the Texas
faithful occurred when the handlers
were walking back
to the tunnel and Bevo stopped to take
a gargantuan
shit all over the letters "S",
"K", and "A" in the
"Nebraska" spelled out in their end
zone. I cheer
wildly. I pick up the empty Traveler
bottle and stick
my tongue in it. I am thirsty.
6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as
I walk back
to the truck. I would taunt them with
some off-color
remarks about their parentage, but I am
too drunk to
form complete sentences. With my last
cognitive
thought of the evening, I take solace
in the fact that
if we had not beaten them in October,
they would be
playing Florida State for the national
championship.
6:30 Back in the car. On the way back
to Austin for
the 8:00 Texas-Arizona tip off. We can
still salvage
the day! I crack open a beer. It is
warm. I don't
care.
7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am
hungry. I go
inside the store. I walk past the beer
frig. I
notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I
wonder if
it's any good. I pull a Zima from the
frig. I twist
the top off and drink the Zima in three
swallows.
Zima
sucks. I replace the empty bottle in
the frig.
7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the
store. I walk to
where the ingredients are, where the
person usually
makes the sub. There is no one there. I
lean over
the counter and scoop out half a bucket
of black
olives. I eat them. I am still hungry.
I lean
further over the counter and grab
approximately two
pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the
store
grunting and eating Pastrami. The
patrons in the
store fear me. I don't care.
8:01 We are in South Austin. I have
been drinking
warm beer and singing Brooks and Dunn
tunes for over
an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my
singing. He
suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn
have written
other good songs besides "You're Going
to Miss Me When
I'm Gone" and "Neon Moon" and that
maybe listening to
only those two songs, ten times each
was a bit
excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I
could just let the
CD play on its own. I tell him to
fuck off and
restart "Neon Moon."
8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My
truckmate,
against my loud and profane
protestations, parks on
the top floor of a nearby parking
garage. I tell him
he's an idiot. I tell him we will never
get out. I
tell him we may as well pitch a
fucking tent here. He
ignores me. I think he's still pissed
about the
Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle "Neon
Moon" loudly.
8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers
stuffed in
my pants. We're going to kick the
shit out of
Arizona.
9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona
29. I am
pleased. I go to the bathroom to pee
for the 67th
time today. I giggle to myself because
of the
new opportunity to do "the bathroom
Brice." There are
no Arizona fans in the bathroom. I am
disappointed.
I tell myself (out loud) that I have a
"Niiiiiice
cock." No one is amused but me.
9:41 I walk to the bathroom while
drinking Bud Light
out of a can. Needless to say, they do
not sell beer
at the Erwin Center, much less Bud
Light out of a can.
I am stopped by an usher: "Where did
you get
that, sir?" I tell him (no shit):
"Oh, the
cheerleaders were throwing them up with
those little
plastic footballs. Would you mind
throwing this away
for me?" I take the last swig and hand
it to him. He
is confused. I pretend I'm going to the
bathroom, but
I run away giggling instead. I duck
into some
entrance to avoid the usher, who is now
pursuing me.
I sneak into a large group of people
and sit down.
The
usher walks by harmlessly. I am
giggling like a little
girl. I crack open another can of Bud
Light.
9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid
the usher, I
have lost my bearings. I have no ticket
stub. I
cannot find my seats. Texas is losing.
10:09 Texas is being screwed by the
refs. I am
enraged. I have cleared out the seats
around me
because I keep removing my hat and
beating the
surrounding chairs with it. A concerned
fan asks if
I'm OK and perhaps I shouldn't take it
so seriously.
I tell him to fuck off.
10:15 After the fourth consecutive
"worst fucking
call I have EVER seen," I attempt to
remove my hat
again to begin beating inanimate
objects. However, on
this occasion I miscalculate and I
thumbnail myself in
my left eyelid, leaving a one-quarter
inch gash over
my eye. I am now bleeding into my left
eye and all
over my shirt. "Perhaps," I think to
myself, "I'm
taking this a bit seriously."
10:22 I am standing in the bathroom
peeing. I'm so
drunk I am swaying and grunting. I have
a bloody
napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants
are bloody.
I have my (formerly) white shirt
wrapped around my
waist. I look like I should be in an
episode of Cops.
10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody
white shirt
back on my body and make my way for the
exits. I am
stopped every 20 seconds by a good
samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me
why I am
covered in blood, but I merely grunt
incoherently and
keep moving.
10:59 With my one good eye, I have
located the
parking garage. I walk up six flights
of stairs,
promise that when I see my friend I
will punch him
in the face for making me walk up six
flights of
stairs, find the truck, and collapse in
a heap in the
bed of the truck. I look around and
notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around
the garage, six
whole flights, and no one is moving. I
take a nap.
11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my
friend in the
driver's seat. I lift my head to look
out the bed of
the truck and notice that traffic is
lined up all the
way around the garage, six whole
flights, and no one
is
moving. I am too tired to punch my
friend. I call my
friend a "Stupid fuck."
11:31 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a "Stupid fuck."

11:38 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a "Stupid fuck."

11:47 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a "Stupid fuck."

11:58 I am jostled. The truck is
moving. I lift my
head to look out the bed of the truck
and notice that
traffic is beginning to move on the
second floor. I
jump out of the truck, walk to the edge
of the parking
facility, and pee off the sixth floor
onto the street
below. My friend looks at me like I
just anally
violated his minor sister. I turn
around and pee
on the front of his truck while singing
the lyrics
to "Neon Moon."
12:11 We are moving. We are out of
beer. I jump
from the truck and go from vehicle to
vehicle until
someone gives me two beers. I am happy.
I return to
my vehicle.
12:26 We have emerged from the parking
facility. We
make our way to my apartment and find
Ed sitting on
the couch with a freshly opened bottle
of Glenlivet on
the coffee table in front of him. We
are all going to
die tonight.
12:59 We have finished three-quarters
of the bottle
of Glenlivet. We decide it would be a
wonderful idea
to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has
to pee. He
walks down the hall to our apartment
and directly into
the full length mirror at the end of
the hall,
smashing it into hundreds of pieces. We
giggle
uncontrollably and leave for
PollyEsther's.
1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs
uncontrollably
at our efforts to enter his club.
"Fellas," he says
in between his fits of spastic
laughter, "I've been
working this door for almost a year.
I've been
working
doors in this town for almost 5 years.
And I can
honestly say that I ain't never seen
three drunker
mother fuckers than you three.
Sorry, can't let you
in." We attempt to reason with him. He
laughs
harder.
1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We
take two
steps in the door and hear "Last call
for alcohol!" I
turn to the group and mutter: "See, dat
wasn't that
fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that
at the
Awamo...the awaom...the
alab...fuck it, that stadium
we
was at today..." We order 6 shots of
tequila and
three beers.
2:15 Back on the street. We need food.
We hail a
cab to take us the two and one half
blocks to Katz's.
The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10
and tell him
to keep it.
2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give
the hostess
$50. We are seated immediately.
2:25 We order two orders of fried
pickles, a Cobb
salad, a bowl of soup, two orders of
Blueberry
blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a
hamburger, two
cheese stuffed potatoes, an order of
fries, and an
order of onion rings.
2:39 The food arrives. We are all
asleep with our
heads on the table. The waiter wakes us
up. We eat
every fucking bit of our food. Most
of the restaurant
patrons around us are disgusted. We
don't give a
shit.
The tab is $112 with tip.
2:46 I'm sleepy.
9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman.
She is the
bartender at Katz's. She is not pretty.

no Arizona fans in the bathroom. I am
disappointed.
I tell myself (out loud) that I have a
"Niiiiiice
cock." No one is amused but me.
9:41 I walk to the bathroom while
drinking Bud Light
out of a can. Needless to say, they do
not sell beer
at the Erwin Center, much less Bud
Light out of a can.
I am stopped by an usher: "Where did
you get
that, sir?" I tell him (no shit):
"Oh, the
cheerleaders were throwing them up with
those little
plastic footballs. Would you mind
throwing this away
for me?" I take the last swig and hand
it to him. He
is confused. I pretend I'm going to the
bathroom, but
I run away giggling instead. I duck
into some
entrance to avoid the usher, who is now
pursuing me.
I sneak into a large group of people
and sit down.
The
usher walks by harmlessly. I am
giggling like a little
girl. I crack open another can of Bud
Light.
9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid
the usher, I
have lost my bearings. I have no ticket
stub. I
cannot find my seats. Texas is losing.
10:09 Texas is being screwed by the
refs. I am
enraged. I have cleared out the seats
around me
because I keep removing my hat and
beating the
surrounding chairs with it. A concerned
fan asks if
I'm OK and perhaps I shouldn't take it
so seriously.
I tell him to fuck off.
10:15 After the fourth consecutive
"worst fucking
call I have EVER seen," I attempt to
remove my hat
again to begin beating inanimate
objects. However, on
this occasion I miscalculate and I
thumbnail myself in
my left eyelid, leaving a one-quarter
inch gash over
my eye. I am now bleeding into my left
eye and all
over my shirt. "Perhaps," I think to
myself, "I'm
taking this a bit seriously."
10:22 I am standing in the bathroom
peeing. I'm so
drunk I am swaying and grunting. I have
a bloody
napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants
are bloody.
I have my (formerly) white shirt
wrapped around my
waist. I look like I should be in an
episode of Cops.
10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody
white shirt
back on my body and make my way for the
exits. I am
stopped every 20 seconds by a good
samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me
why I am
covered in blood, but I merely grunt
incoherently and
keep moving.
10:59 With my one good eye, I have
located the
parking garage. I walk up six flights
of stairs,
promise that when I see my friend I
will punch him
in the face for making me walk up six
flights of
stairs, find the truck, and collapse in
a heap in the
bed of the truck. I look around and
notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around
the garage, six
whole flights, and no one is moving. I
take a nap.
11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my
friend in the
driver's seat. I lift my head to look
out the bed of
the truck and notice that traffic is
lined up all the
way around the garage, six whole
flights, and no one
is
moving. I am too tired to punch my
friend. I call my
friend a "Stupid fuck."
11:31 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a "Stupid fuck."

11:38 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a "Stupid fuck."

11:47 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a "Stupid fuck."

11:58 I am jostled. The truck is
moving. I lift my
head to look out the bed of the truck
and notice that
traffic is beginning to move on the
second floor. I
jump out of the truck, walk to the edge
of the parking
facility, and pee off the sixth floor
onto the street
below. My friend looks at me like I
just anally
violated his minor sister. I turn
around and pee
on the front of his truck while singing
the lyrics
to "Neon Moon."
12:11 We are moving. We are out of
beer. I jump
from the truck and go from vehicle to
vehicle until
someone gives me two beers. I am happy.
I return to
my vehicle.
12:26 We have emerged from the parking
facility. We
make our way to my apartment and find
Ed sitting on
the couch with a freshly opened bottle
of Glenlivet on
the coffee table in front of him. We
are all going to
die tonight.
12:59 We have finished three-quarters
of the bottle
of Glenlivet. We decide it would be a
wonderful idea
to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has
to pee. He
walks down the hall to our apartment
and directly into
the full length mirror at the end of
the hall,
smashing it into hundreds of pieces. We
giggle
uncontrollably and leave for
PollyEsther's.
1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs
uncontrollably
at our efforts to enter his club.
"Fellas," he says
in between his fits of spastic
laughter, "I've been
working this door for almost a year.
I've been
working
doors in this town for almost 5 years.
And I can
honestly say that I ain't never seen
three drunker
mother fuckers than you three.
Sorry, can't let you
in." We attempt to reason with him. He
laughs
harder.
1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We
take two
steps in the door and hear "Last call
for alcohol!" I
turn to the group and mutter: "See, dat
wasn't that
fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that
at the
Awamo...the awaom...the
alab...fuck it, that stadium
we
was at today..." We order 6 shots of
tequila and
three beers.
2:15 Back on the street. We need food.
We hail a
cab to take us the two and one half
blocks to Katz's.
The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10
and tell him
to keep it.
2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give
the hostess
$50. We are seated immediately.
2:25 We order two orders of fried
pickles, a Cobb
salad, a bowl of soup, two orders of
Blueberry
blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a
hamburger, two
cheese stuffed potatoes, an order of
fries, and an
order of onion rings.
2:39 The food arrives. We are all
asleep with our
heads on the table. The waiter wakes us
up. We eat
every fucking bit of our food. Most
of the restaurant
patrons around us are disgusted. We
don't give a
shit.
The tab is $112 with tip.
2:46 I'm sleepy.
9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman.
She is the
bartender at Katz's. She is not pretty.

this is an old one but a great one.
If you dont like this email, then you just don't understand.



A chronology of events for Saturday,  December 4, 1999,
and the early morning hours of Sunday,
December 5, 1999:
6:00 Arise, play the Eyes of Texas and
Texas Fight at
full-freaking blast
6:20 Get in car, drive to New Braunfels

7:30 Tee off (me and a buddy were the
FIRST tee-time
of the morning)
8:50 Turn 9 (crack open first beer)
8:53 Crack open second beer
8:58 Crack open...(you get the idea)
10:30 Finish 18 (holes, as well as
beers), sign
scorecard for smoooooth 95
10:35 Headed for San Antonio
10:50 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and
post-game
festivities
11:10 We decide we don't have enough
booze, so we
double-back to a liquor store and buy
the good ol' 750
ml plastic bottle "Traveler" Jim Beam
11:50 Arrive at the tailgate spot.
Awesome day. Not
a single cloud in the sky. About 70
degrees.
11:55 I decide that we're going to kick
the shit out
of Nebraska.
11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to
go fuck
himself.
12:15 The UT band walks by on the way
to the
Alamodome. We're on the second floor of
a two-story
parking garage on the corner (a couple
hundred of us).
We're hooting and hollering like
wildmen. The band
doubles back to the street right below
us and
serenades us with Texas Fight and The
Eyes of Texas.
AWESOME MOMENT.
12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity,
50-100 grown
men are bumping chests with one
another, each and
every one of them now secure and
certain of the fact
that we are going to kick the
shit out of Nebraska.
1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the
way to the
Alamodome. Again, we hoot and holler
like wildmen.
Again, the band doubles back and stops
right below us
to serenade us, this time, however,
with the Nebraska
fight songs. Although somewhat
impressed by their
spirit and verve, we remain convinced
that we are
going to kick the shit out of
Nebraska.
1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome,
somehow
managing to stuff the "Traveler" and 11
cans of beer
into my pants.
1:47 I am in line surrounded by
Nebraska fans. They
are taunting me. I am taunting back,
still certain
that we are going to kick the
shit out of Nebraska. I
decide to challenge a particularly
vocal Nebraska fan
to play what I now call and will
forever be remembered
as "Cell-Phone Flop Out." Remember flop
out for a
dollar? The rules are similar. I tell
this Nebraska
jackass that if he's so confident in
his team, he
should "flop out" his cell phone RIGHT
NOW and make
plane reservations to Phoenix for the
Fiesta Bowl.
And then I spoke these memorable words:
"And not
those
damn refundable tickets, either! You
request those
non-refundable, non-transferrable
sons-of-bitches!"
He backs down. He is unworthy. I call
Southwest
Airlines and buy two tickets to
Phoenix,
non-refundable
and non-transferrable. Price: $712. He
is humbled.
He lowers his head in shame. I raise my
cell phone in
triumph to the cheers of hundreds of
Texas fans. I am
KING and these are my subjects. I
distribute the 11
beers in my pants to the cheering
masses. I RULE the
pre-game kingdom.
2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence,
I open the
Traveler and pour my first stiffy.
2:45 I notice something troubling:
Nebraska is big.
Nebraska is fast. Nebraska is very
pissed off at
Texas.
3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends.
9 yards
total offense for Texas. Zero first
downs for Texas.
I'm still talking shit. I pour
another stiffy from
the Traveler.
3:36 Four minutes to go in the first
half: the
Traveler is a dead soldier. I buy my
first $5 beer
from the Alamodome merchants. While I
am standing in
line, a center snap nearly decapitates
Major
Applewhite
and rolls out of the end zone. Safety.
3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas
0. I wish I
had another Traveler.
4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska
fan in the
bathroom at halftime, I attempt to
revive the classic
Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:
"Hey, buddy,
niiiiiiiiice cock." He is
unamused.
4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from
the Alamodome
merchants. I share my beer with two
high school girls
sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they
are equipped
with a flask full of vodka. I send them
off to
purchase $5 Sprites, so that we may
consume their
vodka. I have not lost faith. Nebraska
is a bunch of
pussies.
4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting
behind me have
fled for their lives. I purchase two
more $5 beers
from the Alamodome merchants.
5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I
am beginning
to lose faith. This normally would
trouble me, but I
am too drunk to see the football field.

5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: "I'm
sorry, sir.
Those tickets have been confirmed and
are
non-refundable and non-transferrable."
5:37 I try to start a fight with every
person behind
the concession counter. As it turns
out, the
Alamodome has a policy that no beer can
be sold when
there is less than 10 minutes on the
game clock. I am
enraged by this policy. I ask loudly:
"Why the fuck
didn't you announce last call over the
fucking PA
system??!!"
5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in
my chair in
defeat. All of a sudden, the Texas
crowd goes
absolutely nuts. "Whazzis?," I mutter,
awaking from
my coma, "Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?"
Alas, the
answer is no, we were not winning and
we did not
score.
The largest (by far) cheer of the day
from the Texas
faithful occurred when the handlers
were walking back
to the tunnel and Bevo stopped to take
a gargantuan
shit all over the letters "S",
"K", and "A" in the
"Nebraska" spelled out in their end
zone. I cheer
wildly. I pick up the empty Traveler
bottle and stick
my tongue in it. I am thirsty.
6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as
I walk back
to the truck. I would taunt them with
some off-color
remarks about their parentage, but I am
too drunk to
form complete sentences. With my last
cognitive
thought of the evening, I take solace
in the fact that
if we had not beaten them in October,
they would be
playing Florida State for the national
championship.
6:30 Back in the car. On the way back
to Austin for
the 8:00 Texas-Arizona tip off. We can
still salvage
the day! I crack open a beer. It is
warm. I don't
care.
7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am
hungry. I go
inside the store. I walk past the beer
frig. I
notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I
wonder if
it's any good. I pull a Zima from the
frig. I twist
the top off and drink the Zima in three
swallows.
Zima
sucks. I replace the empty bottle in
the frig.
7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the
store. I walk to
where the ingredients are, where the
person usually
makes the sub. There is no one there. I
lean over
the counter and scoop out half a bucket
of black
olives. I eat them. I am still hungry.
I lean
further over the counter and grab
approximately two
pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the
store
grunting and eating Pastrami. The
patrons in the
store fear me. I don't care.
8:01 We are in South Austin. I have
been drinking
warm beer and singing Brooks and Dunn
tunes for over
an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my
singing. He
suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn
have written
other good songs besides "You're Going
to Miss Me When
I'm Gone" and "Neon Moon" and that
maybe listening to
only those two songs, ten times each
was a bit
excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I
could just let the
CD play on its own. I tell him to
fuck off and
restart "Neon Moon."
8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My
truckmate,
against my loud and profane
protestations, parks on
the top floor of a nearby parking
garage. I tell him
he's an idiot. I tell him we will never
get out. I
tell him we may as well pitch a
fucking tent here. He
ignores me. I think he's still pissed
about the
Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle "Neon
Moon" loudly.
8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers
stuffed in
my pants. We're going to kick the
shit out of
Arizona.
9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona
29. I am
pleased. I go to the bathroom to pee
for the 67th
time today. I giggle to myself because
of the
new opportunity to do "the bathroom
Brice." There are
no Arizona fans in the bathroom. I am
disappointed.
I tell myself (out loud) that I have a
"Niiiiiice
cock." No one is amused but me.
9:41 I walk to the bathroom while
drinking Bud Light
out of a can. Needless to say, they do
not sell beer
at the Erwin Center, much less Bud
Light out of a can.
I am stopped by an usher: "Where did

going to kick the shit out of
Nebraska.
1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome,
somehow
managing to stuff the "Traveler" and 11
cans of beer
into my pants.
1:47 I am in line surrounded by
Nebraska fans. They
are taunting me. I am taunting back,
still certain
that we are going to kick the
shit out of Nebraska. I
decide to challenge a particularly
vocal Nebraska fan
to play what I now call and will
forever be remembered
as "Cell-Phone Flop Out." Remember flop
out for a
dollar? The rules are similar. I tell
this Nebraska
jackass that if he's so confident in
his team, he
should "flop out" his cell phone RIGHT
NOW and make
plane reservations to Phoenix for the
Fiesta Bowl.
And then I spoke these memorable words:
"And not
those
damn refundable tickets, either! You
request those
non-refundable, non-transferrable
sons-of-bitches!"
He backs down. He is unworthy. I call
Southwest
Airlines and buy two tickets to
Phoenix,
non-refundable
and non-transferrable. Price: $712. He
is humbled.
He lowers his head in shame. I raise my
cell phone in
triumph to the cheers of hundreds of
Texas fans. I am
KING and these are my subjects. I
distribute the 11
beers in my pants to the cheering
masses. I RULE the
pre-game kingdom.
2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence,
I open the
Traveler and pour my first stiffy.
2:45 I notice something troubling:
Nebraska is big.
Nebraska is fast. Nebraska is very
pissed off at
Texas.
3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends.
9 yards
total offense for Texas. Zero first
downs for Texas.
I'm still talking shit. I pour
another stiffy from
the Traveler.
3:36 Four minutes to go in the first
half: the
Traveler is a dead soldier. I buy my
first $5 beer
from the Alamodome merchants. While I
am standing in
line, a center snap nearly decapitates
Major
Applewhite
and rolls out of the end zone. Safety.
3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas
0. I wish I
had another Traveler.
4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska
fan in the
bathroom at halftime, I attempt to
revive the classic
Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:
"Hey, buddy,
niiiiiiiiice cock." He is
unamused.
4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from
the Alamodome
merchants. I share my beer with two
high school girls
sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they
are equipped
with a flask full of vodka. I send them
off to
purchase $5 Sprites, so that we may
consume their
vodka. I have not lost faith. Nebraska
is a bunch of
pussies.
4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting
behind me have
fled for their lives. I purchase two
more $5 beers
from the Alamodome merchants.
5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I
am beginning
to lose faith. This normally would
trouble me, but I
am too drunk to see the football field.

5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: "I'm
sorry, sir.
Those tickets have been confirmed and
are
non-refundable and non-transferrable."
5:37 I try to start a fight with every
person behind
the concession counter. As it turns
out, the
Alamodome has a policy that no beer can
be sold when
there is less than 10 minutes on the
game clock. I am
enraged by this policy. I ask loudly:
"Why the fuck
didn't you announce last call over the
fucking PA
system??!!"
5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in
my chair in
defeat. All of a sudden, the Texas
crowd goes
absolutely nuts. "Whazzis?," I mutter,
awaking from
my coma, "Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?"
Alas, the
answer is no, we were not winning and
we did not
score.
The largest (by far) cheer of the day
from the Texas
faithful occurred when the handlers
were walking back
to the tunnel and Bevo stopped to take
a gargantuan
shit all over the letters "S",
"K", and "A" in the
"Nebraska" spelled out in their end
zone. I cheer
wildly. I pick up the empty Traveler
bottle and stick
my tongue in it. I am thirsty.
6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as
I walk back
to the truck. I would taunt them with
some off-color
remarks about their parentage, but I am
too drunk to
form complete sentences. With my last
cognitive
thought of the evening, I take solace
in the fact that
if we had not beaten them in October,
they would be
playing Florida State for the national
championship.
6:30 Back in the car. On the way back
to Austin for
the 8:00 Texas-Arizona tip off. We can
still salvage
the day! I crack open a beer. It is
warm. I don't
care.
7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am
hungry. I go
inside the store. I walk past the beer
frig. I
notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I
wonder if
it's any good. I pull a Zima from the
frig. I twist
the top off and drink the Zima in three
swallows.
Zima
sucks. I replace the empty bottle in
the frig.
7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the
store. I walk to
where the ingredients are, where the
person usually
makes the sub. There is no one there. I
lean over
the counter and scoop out half a bucket
of black
olives. I eat them. I am still hungry.
I lean
further over the counter and grab
approximately two
pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the
store
grunting and eating Pastrami. The
patrons in the
store fear me. I don't care.
8:01 We are in South Austin. I have
been drinking
warm beer and singing Brooks and Dunn
tunes for over
an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my
singing. He
suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn
have written
other good songs besides "You're Going
to Miss Me When
I'm Gone" and "Neon Moon" and that
maybe listening to
only those two songs, ten times each
was a bit
excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I
could just let the
CD play on its own. I tell him to
fuck off and
restart "Neon Moon."
8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My
truckmate,
against my loud and profane
protestations, parks on
the top floor of a nearby parking
garage. I tell him
he's an idiot. I tell him we will never
get out. I
tell him we may as well pitch a
fucking tent here. He
ignores me. I think he's still pissed
about the
Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle "Neon
Moon" loudly.
8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers
stuffed in
my pants. We're going to kick the
shit out of
Arizona.
9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona
29. I am
pleased. I go to the bathroom to pee
for the 67th
time today. I giggle to myself because
of the
new opportunity to do "the bathroom
Brice." There are
no Arizona fans in the bathroom. I am
disappointed.
I tell myself (out loud) that I have a
"Niiiiiice
cock." No one is amused but me.
9:41 I walk to the bathroom while
drinking Bud Light
out of a can. Needless to say, they do
not sell beer
at the Erwin Center, much less Bud
Light out of a can.
I am stopped by an usher: "Where did
you get
that, sir?" I tell him (no shit):
"Oh, the
cheerleaders were throwing them up with
those little
plastic footballs. Would you mind
throwing this away
for me?" I take the last swig and hand
it to him. He
is confused. I pretend I'm going to the
bathroom, but
I run away giggling instead. I duck
into some
entrance to avoid the usher, who is now
pursuing me.
I sneak into a large group of people
and sit down.
The
usher walks by harmlessly. I am
giggling like a little
girl. I crack open another can of Bud
Light.
9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid
the usher, I
have lost my bearings. I have no ticket
stub. I
cannot find my seats. Texas is losing.
10:09 Texas is being screwed by the
refs. I am
enraged. I have cleared out the seats
around me
because I keep removing my hat and
beating the
surrounding chairs with it. A concerned
fan asks if
I'm OK and perhaps I shouldn't take it
so seriously.
I tell him to fuck off.
10:15 After the fourth consecutive
"worst fucking
call I have EVER seen," I attempt to
remove my hat
again to begin beating inanimate
objects. However, on
this occasion I miscalculate and I
thumbnail myself in
my left eyelid, leaving a one-quarter
inch gash over
my eye. I am now bleeding into my left
eye and all
over my shirt. "Perhaps," I think to
myself, "I'm
taking this a bit seriously."
10:22 I am standing in the bathroom
peeing. I'm so
drunk I am swaying and grunting. I have
a bloody
napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants
are bloody.
I have my (formerly) white shirt
wrapped around my
waist. I look like I should be in an
episode of Cops.
10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody
white shirt
back on my body and make my way for the
exits. I am
stopped every 20 seconds by a good
samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me
why I am
covered in blood, but I merely grunt
incoherently and
keep moving.
10:59 With my one good eye, I have
located the
parking garage. I walk up six flights
of stairs,
promise that when I see my friend I
will punch him
in the face for making me walk up six
flights of
stairs, find the truck, and collapse in
a heap in the
bed of the truck. I look around and
notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around
the garage, six
whole flights, and no one is moving. I
take a nap.
11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my
friend in the
driver's seat. I lift my head to look
out the bed of
the truck and notice that traffic is
lined up all the
way around the garage, six whole
flights, and no one
is
moving. I am too tired to punch my
friend. I call my
friend a "Stupid fuck."
11:31 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a "Stupid fuck."

11:38 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a "Stupid fuck."

11:47 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a "Stupid fuck."

11:58 I am jostled. The truck is
moving. I lift my
head to look out the bed of the truck
and notice that
traffic is beginning to move on the
second floor. I
jump out of the truck, walk to the edge
of the parking
facility, and pee off the sixth floor
onto the street
below. My friend looks at me like I
just anally
violated his minor sister. I turn
around and pee
on the front of his truck while singing
the lyrics
to "Neon Moon."
12:11 We are moving. We are out of
beer. I jump
from the truck and go from vehicle to
vehicle until
someone gives me two beers. I am happy.
I return to
my vehicle.
12:26 We have emerged from the parking
facility. We
make our way to my apartment and find
Ed sitting on
the couch with a freshly opened bottle
of Glenlivet on
the coffee table in front of him. We
are all going to
die tonight.
12:59 We have finished three-quarters
of the bottle
of Glenlivet. We decide it would be a
wonderful idea
to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has
to pee. He
walks down the hall to our apartment
and directly into
the full length mirror at the end of
the hall,
smashing it into hundreds of pieces. We
giggle
uncontrollably and leave for
PollyEsther's.
1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs
uncontrollably
at our efforts to enter his club.
"Fellas," he says
in between his fits of spastic
laughter, "I've been
working this door for almost a year.
I've been
working
doors in this town for almost 5 years.
And I can
honestly say that I ain't never seen
three drunker
mother fuckers than you three.
Sorry, can't let you
in." We attempt to reason with him. He
laughs
harder.
1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We
take two
steps in the door and hear "Last call
for alcohol!" I
turn to the group and mutter: "See, dat
wasn't that
fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that
at the
Awamo...the awaom...the
alab...fuck it, that stadium
we
was at today..." We order 6 shots of
tequila and
three beers.
2:15 Back on the street. We need food.
We hail a
cab to take us the two and one half
blocks to Katz's.
The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10
and tell him
to keep it.
2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give
the hostess
$50. We are seated immediately.
2:25 We order two orders of fried
pickles, a Cobb
salad, a bowl of soup, two orders of
Blueberry
blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a
hamburger, two
cheese stuffed potatoes, an order of
fries, and an
order of onion rings.
2:39 The food arrives. We are all
asleep with our
heads on the table. The waiter wakes us
up. We eat
every fucking bit of our food. Most
of the restaurant
patrons around us are disgusted. We
don't give a
shit.
The tab is $112 with tip.
2:46 I'm sleepy.
9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman.
She is the
bartender at Katz's. She is not pretty.

this is an old one but a great one.
If you dont like this email, then you just don't understand.



A chronology of events for Saturday,  December 4, 1999,
and the early morning hours of Sunday,
December 5, 1999:
6:00 Arise, play the Eyes of Texas and
Texas Fight at
full-freaking blast
6:20 Get in car, drive to New Braunfels

7:30 Tee off (me and a buddy were the
FIRST tee-time
of the morning)
8:50 Turn 9 (crack open first beer)
8:53 Crack open second beer
8:58 Crack open...(you get the idea)
10:30 Finish 18 (holes, as well as
beers), sign
scorecard for smoooooth 95
10:35 Headed for San Antonio
10:50 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and
post-game
festivities
11:10 We decide we don't have enough
booze, so we
double-back to a liquor store and buy
the good ol' 750
ml plastic bottle "Traveler" Jim Beam
11:50 Arrive at the tailgate spot.
Awesome day. Not
a single cloud in the sky. About 70
degrees.
11:55 I decide that we're going to kick
the shit out
of Nebraska.
11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to
go fuck
himself.
12:15 The UT band walks by on the way
to the
Alamodome. We're on the second floor of
a two-story
parking garage on the corner (a couple
hundred of us).
We're hooting and hollering like
wildmen. The band
doubles back to the street right below
us and
serenades us with Texas Fight and The
Eyes of Texas.
AWESOME MOMENT.
12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity,
50-100 grown
men are bumping chests with one
another, each and
every one of them now secure and
certain of the fact
that we are going to kick the
shit out of Nebraska.
1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the
way to the
Alamodome. Again, we hoot and holler
like wildmen.
Again, the band doubles back and stops
right below us
to serenade us, this time, however,
with the Nebraska
fight songs. Although somewhat
impressed by their
spirit and verve, we remain convinced
that we are
going to kick the shit out of
Nebraska.
1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome,
somehow
managing to stuff the "Traveler" and 11
cans of beer
into my pants.
1:47 I am in line surrounded by
Nebraska fans. They
are taunting me. I am taunting back,

and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a "Stupid fuck."

11:47 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a "Stupid fuck."

11:58 I am jostled. The truck is
moving. I lift my
head to look out the bed of the truck
and notice that
traffic is beginning to move on the
second floor. I
jump out of the truck, walk to the edge
of the parking
facility, and pee off the sixth floor
onto the street
below. My friend looks at me like I
just anally
violated his minor sister. I turn
around and pee
on the front of his truck while singing
the lyrics
to "Neon Moon."
12:11 We are moving. We are out of
beer. I jump
from the truck and go from vehicle to
vehicle until
someone gives me two beers. I am happy.
I return to
my vehicle.
12:26 We have emerged from the parking
facility. We
make our way to my apartment and find
Ed sitting on
the couch with a freshly opened bottle
of Glenlivet on
the coffee table in front of him. We
are all going to
die tonight.
12:59 We have finished three-quarters
of the bottle
of Glenlivet. We decide it would be a
wonderful idea
to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has
to pee. He
walks down the hall to our apartment
and directly into
the full length mirror at the end of
the hall,
smashing it into hundreds of pieces. We
giggle
uncontrollably and leave for
PollyEsther's.
1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs
uncontrollably
at our efforts to enter his club.
"Fellas," he says
in between his fits of spastic
laughter, "I've been
working this door for almost a year.
I've been
working
doors in this town for almost 5 years.
And I can
honestly say that I ain't never seen
three drunker
mother fuckers than you three.
Sorry, can't let you
in." We attempt to reason with him. He
laughs
harder.
1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We
take two
steps in the door and hear "Last call
for alcohol!" I
turn to the group and mutter: "See, dat
wasn't that
fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that
at the
Awamo...the awaom...the
alab...fuck it, that stadium
we
was at today..." We order 6 shots of
tequila and
three beers.
2:15 Back on the street. We need food.
We hail a
cab to take us the two and one half
blocks to Katz's.
The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10
and tell him
to keep it.
2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give
the hostess
$50. We are seated immediately.
2:25 We order two orders of fried
pickles, a Cobb
salad, a bowl of soup, two orders of
Blueberry
blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a
hamburger, two
cheese stuffed potatoes, an order of
fries, and an
order of onion rings.
2:39 The food arrives. We are all
asleep with our
heads on the table. The waiter wakes us
up. We eat
every fucking bit of our food. Most
of the restaurant
patrons around us are disgusted. We
don't give a
shit.
The tab is $112 with tip.
2:46 I'm sleepy.
9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman.
She is the
bartender at Katz's. She is not pretty.

A chronology of events for Saturday,  December 4, 1999,
and the early morning hours of Sunday,
December 5, 1999:
6:00 Arise, play the Eyes of Texas and
Texas Fight at
full-freaking blast
6:20 Get in car, drive to New Braunfels

7:30 Tee off (me and a buddy were the
FIRST tee-time
of the morning)
8:50 Turn 9 (crack open first beer)
8:53 Crack open second beer
8:58 Crack open...(you get the idea)
10:30 Finish 18 (holes, as well as
beers), sign
scorecard for smoooooth 95
10:35 Headed for San Antonio
10:50 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and
post-game
festivities
11:10 We decide we don't have enough
booze, so we
double-back to a liquor store and buy
the good ol' 750
ml plastic bottle "Traveler" Jim Beam
11:50 Arrive at the tailgate spot.
Awesome day. Not
a single cloud in the sky. About 70
degrees.
11:55 I decide that we're going to kick
the shit out
of Nebraska.
11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to
go fuck
himself.
12:15 The UT band walks by on the way
to the
Alamodome. We're on the second floor of
a two-story
parking garage on the corner (a couple
hundred of us).
We're hooting and hollering like
wildmen. The band
doubles back to the street right below
us and
serenades us with Texas Fight and The
Eyes of Texas.
AWESOME MOMENT.
12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity,
50-100 grown
men are bumping chests with one
another, each and
every one of them now secure and
certain of the fact
that we are going to kick the
shit out of Nebraska.
1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the
way to the
Alamodome. Again, we hoot and holler
like wildmen.
Again, the band doubles back and stops
right below us
to serenade us, this time, however,
with the Nebraska
fight songs. Although somewhat
impressed by their
spirit and verve, we remain convinced
that we are
going to kick the shit out of
Nebraska.
1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome,
somehow
managing to stuff the "Traveler" and 11
cans of beer
into my pants.
1:47 I am in line surrounded by
Nebraska fans. They
are taunting me. I am taunting back,
still certain
that we are going to kick the
shit out of Nebraska. I
decide to challenge a particularly
vocal Nebraska fan
to play what I now call and will
forever be remembered
as "Cell-Phone Flop Out." Remember flop
out for a
dollar? The rules are similar. I tell
this Nebraska
jackass that if he's so confident in
his team, he
should "flop out" his cell phone RIGHT
NOW and make
plane reservations to Phoenix for the
Fiesta Bowl.
And then I spoke these memorable words:
"And not
those
damn refundable tickets, either! You
request those
non-refundable, non-transferrable
sons-of-bitches!"
He backs down. He is unworthy. I call
Southwest
Airlines and buy two tickets to
Phoenix,
non-refundable
and non-transferrable. Price: $712. He
is humbled.
He lowers his head in shame. I raise my
cell phone in
triumph to the cheers of hundreds of
Texas fans. I am
KING and these are my subjects. I
distribute the 11
beers in my pants to the cheering
masses. I RULE the
pre-game kingdom.
2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence,
I open the
Traveler and pour my first stiffy.
2:45 I notice something troubling:
Nebraska is big.
Nebraska is fast. Nebraska is very
pissed off at
Texas.
3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends.
9 yards
total offense for Texas. Zero first
downs for Texas.
I'm still talking shit. I pour
another stiffy from
the Traveler.
3:36 Four minutes to go in the first
half: the
Traveler is a dead soldier. I buy my
first $5 beer
from the Alamodome merchants. While I
am standing in
line, a center snap nearly decapitates
Major
Applewhite
and rolls out of the end zone. Safety.
3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas
0. I wish I
had another Traveler.
4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska
fan in the
bathroom at halftime, I attempt to
revive the classic
Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:
"Hey, buddy,
niiiiiiiiice cock." He is
unamused.
4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from
the Alamodome
merchants. I share my beer with two
high school girls
sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they
are equipped
with a flask full of vodka. I send them
off to
purchase $5 Sprites, so that we may
consume their
vodka. I have not lost faith. Nebraska
is a bunch of
pussies.
4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting
behind me have
fled for their lives. I purchase two
more $5 beers
from the Alamodome merchants.
5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I
am beginning
to lose faith. This normally would
trouble me, but I
am too drunk to see the football field.

5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: "I'm
sorry, sir.
Those tickets have been confirmed and
are
non-refundable and non-transferrable."
5:37 I try to start a fight with every
person behind
the concession counter. As it turns
out, the
Alamodome has a policy that no beer can
be sold when
there is less than 10 minutes on the
game clock. I am
enraged by this policy. I ask loudly:
"Why the fuck
didn't you announce last call over the
fucking PA
system??!!"
5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in
my chair in
defeat. All of a sudden, the Texas
crowd goes
absolutely nuts. "Whazzis?," I mutter,
awaking from
my coma, "Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?"
Alas, the
answer is no, we were not winning and
we did not
score.
The largest (by far) cheer of the day
from the Texas
faithful occurred when the handlers
were walking back
to the tunnel and Bevo stopped to take
a gargantuan
shit all over the letters "S",
"K", and "A" in the
"Nebraska" spelled out in their end
zone. I cheer
wildly. I pick up the empty Traveler
bottle and stick
my tongue in it. I am thirsty.
6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as
I walk back
to the truck. I would taunt them with
some off-color
remarks about their parentage, but I am
too drunk to
form complete sentences. With my last
cognitive
thought of the evening, I take solace
in the fact that
if we had not beaten them in October,
they would be
playing Florida State for the national
championship.
6:30 Back in the car. On the way back
to Austin for
the 8:00 Texas-Arizona tip off. We can
still salvage
the day! I crack open a beer. It is
warm. I don't
care.
7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am
hungry. I go
inside the store. I walk past the beer
frig. I
notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I
wonder if
it's any good. I pull a Zima from the
frig. I twist
the top off and drink the Zima in three
swallows.
Zima
sucks. I replace the empty bottle in
the frig.
7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the
store. I walk to
where the ingredients are, where the
person usually
makes the sub. There is no one there. I
lean over
the counter and scoop out half a bucket
of black
olives. I eat them. I am still hungry.
I lean
further over the counter and grab
approximately two
pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the
store
grunting and eating Pastrami. The
patrons in the
store fear me. I don't care.
8:01 We are in South Austin. I have
been drinking
warm beer and singing Brooks and Dunn
tunes for over
an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my
singing. He
suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn
have written
other good songs besides "You're Going
to Miss Me When
I'm Gone" and "Neon Moon" and that
maybe listening to
only those two songs, ten times each
was a bit
excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I
could just let the
CD play on its own. I tell him to
fuck off and
restart "Neon Moon."
8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My
truckmate,
against my loud and profane
protestations, parks on
the top floor of a nearby parking
garage. I tell him
he's an idiot. I tell him we will never
get out. I
tell him we may as well pitch a
fucking tent here. He
ignores me. I think he's still pissed
about the
Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle "Neon
Moon" loudly.
8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers
stuffed in
my pants. We're going to kick the
shit out of
Arizona.
9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona
29. I am
pleased. I go to the bathroom to pee
for the 67th
time today. I giggle to myself because
of the
new opportunity to do "the bathroom
Brice." There are
no Arizona fans in the bathroom. I am
disappointed.
I tell myself (out loud) that I have a
"Niiiiiice
cock." No one is amused but me.
9:41 I walk to the bathroom while
drinking Bud Light
out of a can. Needless to say, they do
not sell beer
at the Erwin Center, much less Bud
Light out of a can.
I am stopped by an usher: "Where did
you get
that, sir?" I tell him (no shit):
"Oh, the
cheerleaders were throwing them up with
those little
plastic footballs. Would you mind
throwing this away
for me?" I take the last swig and hand
it to him. He
is confused. I pretend I'm going to the
bathroom, but
I run away giggling instead. I duck
into some
entrance to avoid the usher, who is now
pursuing me.
I sneak into a large group of people
and sit down.
The
usher walks by harmlessly. I am
giggling like a little
girl. I crack open another can of Bud
Light.
9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid
the usher, I
have lost my bearings. I have no ticket
stub. I
cannot find my seats. Texas is losing.
10:09 Texas is being screwed by the
refs. I am
enraged. I have cleared out the seats
around me
because I keep removing my hat and
beating the
surrounding chairs with it. A concerned
fan asks if
I'm OK and perhaps I shouldn't take it
so seriously.
I tell him to fuck off.
10:15 After the fourth consecutive
"worst fucking
call I have EVER seen," I attempt to
remove my hat
again to begin beating inanimate
objects. However, on
this occasion I miscalculate and I
thumbnail myself in
my left eyelid, leaving a one-quarter
inch gash over
my eye. I am now bleeding into my left
eye and all
over my shirt. "Perhaps," I think to
myself, "I'm
taking this a bit seriously."
10:22 I am standing in the bathroom
peeing. I'm so
drunk I am swaying and grunting. I have
a bloody
napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants
are bloody.
I have my (formerly) white shirt
wrapped around my
waist. I look like I should be in an
episode of Cops.
10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody
white shirt
back on my body and make my way for the
exits. I am
stopped every 20 seconds by a good
samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me
why I am
covered in blood, but I merely grunt
incoherently and
keep moving.
10:59 With my one good eye, I have
located the
parking garage. I walk up six flights
of stairs,
promise that when I see my friend I
will punch him
in the face for making me walk up six
flights of
stairs, find the truck, and collapse in
a heap in the
bed of the truck. I look around and
notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around
the garage, six
whole flights, and no one is moving. I
take a nap.
11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my
friend in the
driver's seat. I lift my head to look
out the bed of
the truck and notice that traffic is
lined up all the
way around the garage, six whole
flights, and no one
is
moving. I am too tired to punch my
friend. I call my
friend a "Stupid fuck."
11:31 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a "Stupid fuck."

11:38 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a "Stupid fuck."

11:47 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a "Stupid fuck."

11:58 I am jostled. The truck is
moving. I lift my
head to look out the bed of the truck
and notice that
traffic is beginning to move on the
second floor. I
jump out of the truck, walk to the edge
of the parking
facility, and pee off the sixth floor
onto the street
below. My friend looks at me like I
just anally
violated his minor sister. I turn
around and pee
on the front of his truck while singing
the lyrics
to "Neon Moon."
12:11 We are moving. We are out of
beer. I jump
from the truck and go from vehicle to
vehicle until
someone gives me two beers. I am happy.
I return to
my vehicle.
12:26 We have emerged from the parking
facility. We
make our way to my apartment and find
Ed sitting on
the couch with a freshly opened bottle
of Glenlivet on
the coffee table in front of him. We
are all going to
die tonight.
12:59 We have finished three-quarters
of the bottle
of Glenlivet. We decide it would be a
wonderful idea
to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has
to pee. He
walks down the hall to our apartment
and directly into
the full length mirror at the end of
the hall,
smashing it into hundreds of pieces. We
giggle
uncontrollably and leave for
PollyEsther's.
1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs
uncontrollably
at our efforts to enter his club.
"Fellas," he says
in between his fits of spastic
laughter, "I've been
working this door for almost a year.
I've been
working
doors in this town for almost 5 years.
And I can
honestly say that I ain't never seen
three drunker
mother fuckers than you three.
Sorry, can't let you
in." We attempt to reason with him. He
laughs
harder.
1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We
take two
steps in the door and hear "Last call
for alcohol!" I
turn to the group and mutter: "See, dat
wasn't that
fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that
at the
Awamo...the awaom...the
alab...fuck it, that stadium
we
was at today..." We order 6 shots of
tequila and
three beers.
2:15 Back on the street. We need food.
We hail a
cab to take us the two and one half
blocks to Katz's.
The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10
and tell him
to keep it.
2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give
the hostess
$50. We are seated immediately.
2:25 We order two orders of fried
pickles, a Cobb
salad, a bowl of soup, two orders of
Blueberry
blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a
hamburger, two
cheese stuffed potatoes, an order of
fries, and an
order of onion rings.
2:39 The food arrives. We are all
asleep with our
heads on the table. The waiter wakes us
up. We eat
every fucking bit of our food. Most
of the restaurant
patrons around us are disgusted. We
don't give a

The tab is $112 with tip.
2:46 I'm sleepy.
9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman.
She is the
bartender at Katz's. She is not pretty.

"K", and "A" in the
"Nebraska" spelled out in their end
zone. I cheer
wildly. I pick up the empty Traveler
bottle and stick
my tongue in it. I am thirsty.
6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as
I walk back
to the truck. I would taunt them with
some off-color
remarks about their parentage, but I am
too drunk to
form complete sentences. With my last
cognitive
thought of the evening, I take solace
in the fact that
if we had not beaten them in October,
they would be
playing Florida State for the national
championship.
6:30 Back in the car. On the way back
to Austin for
the 8:00 Texas-Arizona tip off. We can
still salvage
the day! I crack open a beer. It is
warm. I don't
care.
7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am
hungry. I go
inside the store. I walk past the beer
frig. I
notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I
wonder if
it's any good. I pull a Zima from the
frig. I twist
the top off and drink the Zima in three
swallows.
Zima
sucks. I replace the empty bottle in
the frig.
7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the
store. I walk to
where the ingredients are, where the
person usually
makes the sub. There is no one there. I
lean over
the counter and scoop out half a bucket
of black
olives. I eat them. I am still hungry.
I lean
further over the counter and grab
approximately two
pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the
store
grunting and eating Pastrami. The
patrons in the
store fear me. I don't care.
8:01 We are in South Austin. I have
been drinking
warm beer and singing Brooks and Dunn
tunes for over
an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my
singing. He
suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn
have written
other good songs besides "You're Going
to Miss Me When
I'm Gone" and "Neon Moon" and that
maybe listening to
only those two songs, ten times each
was a bit
excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I
could just let the
CD play on its own. I tell him to
fuck off and
restart "Neon Moon."
8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My
truckmate,
against my loud and profane
protestations, parks on
the top floor of a nearby parking
garage. I tell him
he's an idiot. I tell him we will never
get out. I
tell him we may as well pitch a
fucking tent here. He
ignores me. I think he's still pissed
about the
Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle "Neon
Moon" loudly.
8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers
stuffed in
my pants. We're going to kick the
shit out of
Arizona.
9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona
29. I am
pleased. I go to the bathroom to pee
for the 67th
time today. I giggle to myself because
of the
new opportunity to do "the bathroom
Brice." There are
no Arizona fans in the bathroom. I am
disappointed.
I tell myself (out loud) that I have a
"Niiiiiice
cock." No one is amused but me.
9:41 I walk to the bathroom while
drinking Bud Light
out of a can. Needless to say, they do
not sell beer
at the Erwin Center, much less Bud
Light out of a can.
I am stopped by an usher: "Where did
you get
that, sir?" I tell him (no shit):
"Oh, the
cheerleaders were throwing them up with
those little
plastic footballs. Would you mind
throwing this away
for me?" I take the last swig and hand
it to him. He
is confused. I pretend I'm going to the
bathroom, but
I run away giggling instead. I duck
into some
entrance to avoid the usher, who is now
pursuing me.
I sneak into a large group of people
and sit down.
The
usher walks by harmlessly. I am
giggling like a little
girl. I crack open another can of Bud
Light.
9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid
the usher, I
have lost my bearings. I have no ticket
stub. I
cannot find my seats. Texas is losing.
10:09 Texas is being screwed by the
refs. I am
enraged. I have cleared out the seats
around me
because I keep removing my hat and
beating the
surrounding chairs with it. A concerned
fan asks if
I'm OK and perhaps I shouldn't take it
so seriously.
I tell him to fuck off.
10:15 After the fourth consecutive
"worst fucking
call I have EVER seen," I attempt to
remove my hat
again to begin beating inanimate
objects. However, on
this occasion I miscalculate and I
thumbnail myself in
my left eyelid, leaving a one-quarter
inch gash over
my eye. I am now bleeding into my left
eye and all
over my shirt. "Perhaps," I think to
myself, "I'm
taking this a bit seriously."
10:22 I am standing in the bathroom
peeing. I'm so
drunk I am swaying and grunting. I have
a bloody
napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants
are bloody.
I have my (formerly) white shirt
wrapped around my
waist. I look like I should be in an
episode of Cops.
10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody
white shirt
back on my body and make my way for the
exits. I am
stopped every 20 seconds by a good
samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me
why I am
covered in blood, but I merely grunt
incoherently and
keep moving.
10:59 With my one good eye, I have
located the
parking garage. I walk up six flights
of stairs,
promise that when I see my friend I
will punch him
in the face for making me walk up six
flights of
stairs, find the truck, and collapse in
a heap in the
bed of the truck. I look around and
notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around
the garage, six
whole flights, and no one is moving. I
take a nap.
11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my
friend in the
driver's seat. I lift my head to look
out the bed of
the truck and notice that traffic is
lined up all the
way around the garage, six whole
flights, and no one
is
moving. I am too tired to punch my
friend. I call my
friend a "Stupid fuck."
11:31 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a "Stupid fuck."

11:38 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a "Stupid fuck."

11:47 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a "Stupid fuck."

11:58 I am jostled. The truck is
moving. I lift my
head to look out the bed of the truck
and notice that
traffic is beginning to move on the
second floor. I
jump out of the truck, walk to the edge
of the parking
facility, and pee off the sixth floor
onto the street
below. My friend looks at me like I
just anally
violated his minor sister. I turn
around and pee
on the front of his truck while singing
the lyrics
to "Neon Moon."
12:11 We are moving. We are out of
beer. I jump
from the truck and go from vehicle to
vehicle until
someone gives me two beers. I am happy.
I return to
my vehicle.
12:26 We have emerged from the parking
facility. We
make our way to my apartment and find
Ed sitting on
the couch with a freshly opened bottle
of Glenlivet on
the coffee table in front of him. We
are all going to
die tonight.
12:59 We have finished three-quarters
of the bottle
of Glenlivet. We decide it would be a
wonderful idea
to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has
to pee. He
walks down the hall to our apartment
and directly into
the full length mirror at the end of
the hall,
smashing it into hundreds of pieces. We
giggle
uncontrollably and leave for
PollyEsther's.
1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs
uncontrollably
at our efforts to enter his club.
"Fellas," he says
in between his fits of spastic
laughter, "I've been
working this door for almost a year.
I've been
working
doors in this town for almost 5 years.
And I can
honestly say that I ain't never seen
three drunker
mother fuckers than you three.
Sorry, can't let you
in." We attempt to reason with him. He
laughs
harder.
1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We
take two
steps in the door and hear "Last call
for alcohol!" I
turn to the group and mutter: "See, dat
wasn't that
fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that
at the
Awamo...the awaom...the
alab...fuck it, that stadium
we
was at today..." We order 6 shots of
tequila and
three beers.
2:15 Back on the street. We need food.
We hail a
cab to take us the two and one half
blocks to Katz's.
The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10
and tell him
to keep it.
2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give
the hostess
$50. We are seated immediately.
2:25 We order two orders of fried
pickles, a Cobb
salad, a bowl of soup, two orders of
Blueberry
blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a
hamburger, two
cheese stuffed potatoes, an order of
fries, and an
order of onion rings.
2:39 The food arrives. We are all
asleep with our
heads on the table. The waiter wakes us
up. We eat
every fucking bit of our food. Most
of the restaurant
patrons around us are disgusted. We
don't give a
shit.
The tab is $112 with tip.
2:46 I'm sleepy.
9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman.
She is the
bartender at Katz's. She is not pretty.

imagine you have a gas well in the middle of west texas and you only have one 
pipeline running to your well.  the guy who owns the pipeline can fuck you 
because you have no choice but to flow your gas that way.  split connect 
means you have at least 2 options to flow your gas so the price the producer 
receives is more competitive and if anything happens to one pipeline you 
don't have  to shut your gas in because you move it to another pipe.  

i'm going out with my brother and sime guys from work tonight.   are you free 
saturday day and night?

I'm trying to get a feel for everyone's desire to play PAINTBALL in the next few weeks.  This would obviously not be sponsored by Enron b/c Enron doesn't have enough cash to buy anything right now.

So let me know if you would be interested and, if so, when you would be available to go.   The cost should be around $30-40 a person.

Please forward to anyone I have forgotten or might be interested.

what's his new job . . . table cloth ironer?  Kennison turned out to be a
real disaster.  I'm beginning to think that many of our recent free agents
are turning out to be other team's trash.  I guess the Tractor Traylor is
not washed up, and he's a big reason why Chicago has turned it around.
Though he did get on Shanny's bad side during Pryce's holdout with some
things he said.  We used to have this guy named Shannon Sharpe.  He's pretty
good too.  If only i could say fuck it all and just  go skiing, but it's
been 70 degrees here for 5 weeks.  It's time Shanny hires me to help him
out.

CRAIG!
What the hell have you been up to?  I just got your email address from Carl. 
  I havent talked to him in about 2 years either.  Last year I tried 
everything to get your address so you could come to my wedding.  I got 
married last July.  My wife, Jennifer, is just finishing up at the U, so she 
is a little younger than us, but she's really cute, intelligent, blah, 
blah....  Anyway, are you still in Portland?  I heard you were working at 
Enron, but apparantly they do not know that since I tried calling several 
times and they had no idea who the fuck I was talking about.  Man, Enron has 
had a tough time.  Amazing considering the talent that works at that 
company...not being sarcastic.  You should do the prudent thing and become a 
teacher/baseball coach like me...no stress, summers off, and job security.  
Plus, the pay is not as bad as it's made out to be...considering you get a 
pension when you retire.  I love it.  Anyway, I don't feel like typing 
anymore, so either give me a call, or I can give you a call if you send your 
number.  I'd love to catch up.  My cell:  206-293-1459.  Call after 2:30 
(yes, that is the end of my work day)  Hope to hear from you soon.

Ollie

Subject: FWD: Fw: cuckoo clock

The other night I was invited out for a night with the "boys".  I told my
wife that i would be home by midnight...promise!  Well, the hours passed and
the beer was going down way too easy.  At around 3 A.M., drunk as a skunk, I
headed home.  Just as I got in the door, the cuckoo clock in the hall
started up, and cuckooed 3 times.  Quickly, I realized she'd probably wake
up, so I cuckooed another 9 times.  I was really proud of myself, having a
quick, witty solution, even when smashed, to escape a possible conflict.
Next morning my wife asked me what time I got in and I told her 12 o'clock.
She didn't seem disturbed at all.  Whew!  Got away with that one!  She then
told me that we needed a new cuckoo clock.  When I asked her why she said
"Well, it cuckooed 3 times, then said "oh fuck", cuckooed 4 more times,
cleared it's throat, cuckooed another 3 times, giggled, cuckooed twice more,
and then farted.

Dear Brothers,
It was good to see everyone make the trek to central Oklahoma to launch
Dent's book.  The Daily Oklahoman published a brief story that suggested Dent
had made up a bunch of lies about Saint Bud Wilkinson steppin out on the old
lady.  Around here, that's like saying the Pope likes it up the ass.
Needless to say, the Sooner faithful were slightly chapped and the university
canceled their offer to host the signing party at our new museum.  Fuck 'em.
Who wants to drink beer in a dusty old museum anyway?
     Del, sorry I couldn't make the party but I did get to see Cdie, Grumbles
, Strange, Woody, Benson, PP, and Space for dinner.  My favorite part was the
full-volume discussion of who had the biggest penis (next to Benson, of
course).  Typical urology shit.  The family next to us failed to recognize a
medical discussion amongst professionals.  Speaking of Benson, he was worried
that his erections might crater all of a sudden just like his near vision has
recently done.  I assured him that this was extremely unlikely but, in his
case, he'd better hope that his cardiac output remains high or else he's
liable to pass out every time he gets a hard on.

                                                                     B. Miller

Things You Won't See On Hallmark Cards...

OUTSIDE: As the days go by, I think of how lucky I am...
INSIDE:  That you're not here to ruin it for me.

OUTSIDE: If I get only one thing for Christmas...
INSIDE:  I hope it's your sister.

OUTSIDE: I've always wanted to have someone to hold, someone to love.
INSIDE:  After having met you, I've changed my mind.

OUTSIDE: I must admit, you brought religion into my life.
INSIDE:  I never believed in hell 'til I met you.

OUTSIDE: Looking back over the years that we've been together, I can't help but wonder...
INSIDE:  What the fuck was I thinking?

OUTSIDE: I always wanted to be rich, powerful and well-respected.
INSIDE:  And while I'm dreaming, I wish you weren't so damn ugly.

OUTSIDE: Sex with you is like using drugs:
INSIDE:  Lots of people do it, but nobody's stupid enough to admit it.

OUTSIDE: When we were together, you always said you'd die for me.
INSIDE:  Now that we've broken up, I think it's time you kept your promise.

OUTSIDE: The holidays are a great time to be with family.
INSIDE:  Of course, your family won't be with you, since I'm taking the kids and moving in with my sister, you cheating bastard!

OUTSIDE: I'm so miserable without you...
INSIDE:  It's almost like you're here.

OUTSIDE: If you ever need a friend...
INSIDE:  Buy a dog.

OUTSIDE: Congratulations on your new bundle of joy.
INSIDE: Did you ever find out who the father was?

CRAIG!
What the hell have you been up to?  I just got your email address from Carl. 
  I havent talked to him in about 2 years either.  Last year I tried 
everything to get your address so you could come to my wedding.  I got 
married last July.  My wife, Jennifer, is just finishing up at the U, so she 
is a little younger than us, but she's really cute, intelligent, blah, 
blah....  Anyway, are you still in Portland?  I heard you were working at 
Enron, but apparantly they do not know that since I tried calling several 
times and they had no idea who the fuck I was talking about.  Man, Enron has 
had a tough time.  Amazing considering the talent that works at that 
company...not being sarcastic.  You should do the prudent thing and become a 
teacher/baseball coach like me...no stress, summers off, and job security.  
Plus, the pay is not as bad as it's made out to be...considering you get a 
pension when you retire.  I love it.  Anyway, I don't feel like typing 
anymore, so either give me a call, or I can give you a call if you send your 
number.  I'd love to catch up.  My cell:  206-293-1459.  Call after 2:30 
(yes, that is the end of my work day)  Hope to hear from you soon.

Ollie

Let me start off by saying YOU MYOPIC, NEARSIGHTED LITTLE FUCK.  Have you
ever been to Tiger Stadium on a Saturday night?  Have you ever heard the
Tiger Band from Tigerland play as the Tigers take the field?  Were you not
there in 1997 when we beat the shit out of the then ranked #1 Florida
Gators?  If you didn't write about sports, would you still feel like a man?
I bet the answer to all of these questions is a resounding NO.  You never
hear any other columnists or coaches banging on other venues within their
conferences because of the respect and pride they have of their own
conference.  You don't deserve the SEC and you don't deserve to write about
it.

I hope you are at the game Saturday night.  Win or lose, a few things will
definitely happen.  1)Before the game, you will get a rush hearing the Tiger
band make their way to the stadium.  2)You will get a rush when the Tigers
run out on the field.  3)You will hold your ears like a pussy when you hear
a crowd like you've never heard before.  4)And lastly, you will wish you
went to LSU.

13.  I'd really like to see how you look when I'm naked

15.  You might not be the best looking girl here, but beauty is only
       a light switch away

16.  Are those real?

17.  You must be the limp doctor because I've got a stiffy.

18.  You can feel the magic between us...No, lower!

19.  I'd walk a million miles for one of your smiles, and even
       farther for that thing you do with your tongue.

20.  Girl, if you were a porch I'd take out all the nails and screw
       ya

33.  I know milk it does a body good, but DAMN, how much have you
been  drinking?

      we could do it in public.

      pizza?

      without me.

them.

40.  If I told you you had a nice body, would you hold IT against me?

I suspect that I am not going to receive a birthday present or Christmas card 
from this fellow.  What do you think?  This is the type of e-mail that we 
usually receive from our friends in California.  Looks like the disease is 
spreading to other areas.

Enron, do you want war in Florida?

You're going to get it! Take your fat, lawsuit-happy-pig Eric Thode and get 
the fuck out of South Florida!

Take your greedy peaker plants and build them in India where you already 
have a track record of beating and helping to kill locals who protested you 
there.

The nerve of you pricks trying to build plants in family communities and on 
the edge of our National Park.

We will stop you!

Where do you think we'll have the most fun? That's what's really important.
If you think Austin will be more fun, then maybe we should go.

As if you guys needed any tips...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1.  I wish you were a door so I could bang you all day long.

2.  (Lick finger and wipe on her shirt)  Let's get  you out of these wet
clothes.

3.  Nice legs...what time do they open?

4.  Do you work for UPS? I could have sworn I saw you checking out my
     package.

5.  You've got 206 bones in your body, want one more?

6.  Can I buy you a drink or do you just want the money?

7.  I may not be the best looking guy in here, but I'm the only one
    talking to you.

8.  I'm a bird watcher and I'm looking for a Big Breasted Bed
    Thrasher, have you seen one?

9.  I'm fighting the urge to make you the happiest woman on earth
     tonight.

10.  Wanna play army? I'll lay down and you can blow the hell outta
       me.

11.  I wish you were a Pony Carousel outside Walmart, so could ride
      you all day long for a quarter.

12.  Oh, I'm sorry, I thought that was a braille name tag.

13.  I'd really like to see how you look when I'm naked

14.  Is that a ladder in your stockings or the stairway the heaven?

15.  You might not be the best looking girl here, but beauty is only
       a light switch away

16.  Are those real?

17.  You must be the limp doctor because I've got a stiffy.

18.  You can feel the magic between us...No, lower!

19.  I'd walk a million miles for one of your smiles, and even
       farther for that thing you do with your tongue.

20.  Girl, if you were a porch I'd take out all the nails and screw
       ya
21.  If it's true that we are what we eat, then I could be you by
      morning.
22.  (Look down at the crotch)  It's not just going to suck tself.

23.  You know, if I were you, I'd have sex with me.

24.  You. Me. Whipped cream. Handcuffs. Any Questions?

25.  Fuck me if I'm wrong but is your name Helga?

26.  Those clothes would look great in a crumpled heap on my bedroom
       floor.

27.  My name is (name)...remember that, you'll be screaming it later.

28.  Do you believe in love at first sight or should I walk by again?

29.  Hi, I'm Mr. Right. Someone said you were looking for me.

30.  My friend wants to know if YOU think I'M cute."

31.  Hi, the voices in my head told me to come over and talk to you.

32.  My name isn't Elmo, but you can tickle me anytime you want to.

33.  I know milk it does a body good, but DAMN, how much have you
been  drinking?

34.  If you were the last woman and I was the last man onearth, I bet
      we could do it in public.

35.  Wanna come over for some pizza and sex? No? What you don't like
      pizza?

36.  I may not be Dairy Queen but I'll treat you right.

37.  Baby, I'm an American Express lover...you shouldn't go home
      without me.

38.  Do you sleep on your stomach at night? Can I???

39.  Do you wash your pants in Windex because I can see myself in
them.

40.  If I told you you had a nice body, would you hold IT against me?

41.  I lost my puppy, can you help me find him? I think he went into
       this cheap motel  room.

42.  If I could rewrite the alphabet, I would put you and I together.

43.  Let me check the tag on your shirt, I want to see if it says
      "Made in Heaven"

44.  Hey nice shoes, wanna fuck?

Body:
The homework assignment of the fourth grade
was to have each child get their parents to tell
them a story with a moral at the end of it.

The next day the kids came back and one by
one began to tell their stories.

Kathy said, "My father's a farmer and we have
a lot of egg-laying hens. One time we were
taking our eggs to market in a basket on the
front seat of the pickup when we hit a bump in
the road and all the eggs went flying and broke
and made a mess."

"And what's the moral of the story?"
Asked the teacher.

"Don't put all your eggs in one basket!"

"Very good," said the teacher. "Now, Lucy?"

"Our family are farmers too. But we raise
chickens for the meat market. We had a
dozen eggs one time, but when they hatched
we only got ten live chicks. And the moral
to this story is, don't count your chickens
until they're hatched."

"That was a fine story, Lucy. Johnny, do
you have a story to share?"

"Yes, ma'am, my daddy told me this story
about my Aunt Karen. Aunt Karen was a
flight engineer in Desert Storm and her plane
got hit. She had to bail out over enemy
territory and all she had was a bottle of
whiskey, a machine gun and a machete. She
drank the whiskey on the way down so it
wouldn't break and then she landed right in
the middle of 100 enemy troops. She killed
seventy of them with the machine gun until
she ran out of bullets, then she killed twenty
more with the machete till the blade broke
and then she killed the last ten with her
bare hands."

"Good heavens," said the horrified teacher,
"what kind of moral did your daddy tell you
from that horrible story?"

"Don't fuck with Aunt Karen when
she's been drinking."

Enron, do you want war in Florida?

You're going to get it! Take your fat, lawsuit-happy-pig Eric Thode and get 
the fuck out of South Florida!

Take your greedy peaker plants and build them in India where you already 
have a track record of beating and helping to kill locals who protested you 
there.

The nerve of you pricks trying to build plants in family communities and on 
the edge of our National Park.

We will stop you!

Little Johnny


LITTLE JOHNNY AND THE CONDOM
Little Johnny walked into his dad's bedroom one day only to catch him
sitting on the side of his bed sliding a condom onto his penis in
preparation of sex with his wife. Johnny's father in an attempt to hide his
full erection with a condom on it bent over as if to look under the bed.
Little Johnny asked curiously "What ya doin dad? His father quickly
replied, "I thought I saw a rat go underneath the bed." To which Little
Johnny replied "What ya gonna do, fuck him?"

LITTLE JOHNNY AND THE VAGINA
Little Johnny's mother decided to give her son an anatomy lesson one day,
so she took off all of her clothes and pointed to her vagina, and said,
"Johnny, this is where you come from." Johnny went to school the next day
smiling and insisting that all his friends now refer to him as Lucky Johnny
"Why?" one asked. Johnny held his fingers an inch apart and said, "Because
I came this close to being a turd."

LITTLE JOHNNY, THE SMART ASS
A traveling salesman rings the doorbell and 10-year-old Little Johnny
answers, holding a beer and smoking a fat cigar.  The salesman says, little
boy, is your mother home?" Little Johnny taps his ash on the carpet and
says, "What the fuck do you think?"

LITTLE JOHNNY AND TEACHERS
Little Johnny returns from school and says he got an F in arithmetic
"Why?"  asks the father. "The teacher asked 'How much is 2x3?' I said '6'"
"But that's right!"  "Then she asked me 'How much is 3x2?'" "What's the
fucking difference?"  asks the father. "That's what I said!" replied Little
Johnny

JOHNNY AND THE MULTI-SYLLABLE WORD
Little Johnny goes to school, and the teacher says, 'Today we are going to
learn multi-syllable words, class. Does anybody have an example of a
multi-syllable word?' Little Johnny waves his hand, 'Me, Miss Rogers,  me,
me!' Miss
Rogers: All right, little Johnny, what is your multi-syllable word?  Little
Johnny says, 'Mas-tur-bate.' Miss Rogers smiles and says,'Wow, little
Johnny, that's a mouthful.' Little Johnny says, 'No, Miss Rogers,you're
thinking of a blowjob."

LITTLE JOHNNY AND BABIES
Little Johnny came running into the house and asked, "Mommy, can little
girls have babies?" "No," said his Mom, "of course not." Little Johnny
then ran back outside and his Mom heard him yell to his friends, "It's
okay, we can play that game again!"

LITTLE JOHNNY AND GOING TO THE BATHROOM
Little Johnny was sitting in class one day. All of the sudden, he needed to
go to the bathroom. He yelled out, "Miss Jones, I need to take a piss!" The
teacher replied, "Now, Johnny, that is NOT the proper word to use in this
situation. The correct word you want to use is 'urinate.' Please use the
word 'urinate' in a sentence correctly, and I will allow you to go." Little
Johnny thinks for a bit, then says, "You're an eight too, but if you had
bigger tits, you'd be a ten!"

LITTLE JOHNNY AND GRAMMAR
One day, during a lesson on proper grammar, the teacher asked for a show of
hands from those who could use the word "beautiful" in the same sentence
twice. First, she called on little Suzy, who responded with, "My father
bought my mother a beautiful dress and she looked beautiful in it." "Very
good, Suzy," replied the teacher. She then called on little Michael. "My
mommy planned a beautiful banquet and it turned out beautifully," he
said.   "Excellent, Michael!" Then, the teacher called on little Johnny.
"Last night, at the dinner table, my sister told my father that she was
pregnant,  and he said, 'Beautiful, .......just fucking beautiful!'"

Bubba, 
 
Don't talk to Patro that way.  He is a friend  of mine.  That girl he was speaking to at the Astros game was his  daughter.  He can't help that she is taller than him.  That doesn't  make him any less a man......or does it?
 
My update......I'm living in New Jersey,  married 9 years with two boys, six and three.  I work in  Manhattan for NIKE.  I'm the East Coast Baseball Field Rep. dealing with  agents and athletes.  I guess you could say that I give away free stuff to  millionaires while I am looking for the next Jeter/Griffey/A-Rod/etc.  I  actually get paid to go to Yankee and Shea Stadiums and interact with the  athletes, watch baseball games. and read the sports section.  Someone  has to do it.
 
I know what you are thinking and the answer is  no.  I won't get you free shoes.
 
Hope every is well.  Glad to see the Phi Delt  love being passed along.  The best place to send me a message is at work at  mike.cavers@nike.com  or home at  cooperscloset@msn.com .

Hey Patro, thanks for  coming over and talking to me at the Astros game the other day. Were you  afraid I would see you with your girlfriend.  Whatever....you're still a  short fuck with no wrap. 
Middletones....Is that what you were playing  all those years?  I thought that you were making crude noises with your  stomach.  Are you still in Temple? 
Yeah this is  Trammell.....living in Houston, have two little girls and Lisa's still married  to me.  I'm getting my ass kicked by them daily.

Enron, do you want war in Florida?

You're going to get it! Take your fat, lawsuit-happy-pig Eric Thode and get 
the fuck out of South Florida!

Take your greedy peaker plants and build them in India where you already 
have a track record of beating and helping to kill locals who protested you 
there.

The nerve of you pricks trying to build plants in family communities and on 
the edge of our National Park.

We will stop you!

Dear Brothers,
It was good to see everyone make the trek to central Oklahoma to launch
Dent's book.  The Daily Oklahoman published a brief story that suggested
Dent
had made up a bunch of lies about Saint Bud Wilkinson steppin out on the old
lady.  Around here, that's like saying the Pope likes it up the ass.
Needless to say, the Sooner faithful were slightly chapped and the
university
canceled their offer to host the signing party at our new museum.  Fuck 'em.
Who wants to drink beer in a dusty old museum anyway?
     Del, sorry I couldn't make the party but I did get to see Cdie,
Grumbles
, Strange, Woody, Benson, PP, and Space for dinner.  My favorite part was
the
full-volume discussion of who had the biggest penis (next to Benson, of
course).  Typical urology shit.  The family next to us failed to recognize a
medical discussion amongst professionals.  Speaking of Benson, he was
worried
that his erections might crater all of a sudden just like his near vision
has
recently done.  I assured him that this was extremely unlikely but, in his
case, he'd better hope that his cardiac output remains high or else he's
liable to pass out every time he gets a hard on.

                                                                     B.

Some phrases you wish you could say at work:

1. Ahhh...I see the fuck-up fairy has visited us again...

2. I don't know what your problem is, but I'll bet it's hard to pronounce.

3. How about never? Is never good for you?

4. I see you've set aside this special time to humiliate yourself
in  public.

5. I'll try being nicer if you'll try being smarter.

6. I don't work here. I'm a consultant.

7. I can see your point, but I still think you're full of shit.

8. I like you. You remind me of when I was young and stupid.

9. You are validating my inherent mistrust of strangers.

10. I have plenty of talent and vision.  I just don't give a damn.

11. I'm already visualizing the duct tape over your mouth.

12. Any connection between your reality and mine is purely
coincidental.

13. I'm not being rude.  You're just insignificant.

14. Yes, I am an agent of Satan, but my duties are largely ceremonial.

15. You sound reasonable.  Time to up the medication.

16. And your crybaby whiny-butt opinion would be...?

17. Do I look like a people person?

18. This isn't an office.  It's Hell with fluorescent lighting.

19. I started out with nothing & still have most of it left.

20. You!... Off my planet!

21. Does your train of thought have a caboose?

22. Errors have been made.  Others will be blamed.

23. Not all men are annoying. Some are dead.

24. I'm trying to imagine you with a personality.

25. Can I trade this job for what's behind door 1?

26. Too many freaks, not enough circuses.

27. How do I set a laser printer to stun?

28. If I throw a stick, will you leave?

> > A chronology of events for Saturday, December 4, 1999, and the early
morning
hours of Sunday, December 5, 1999:
6:00 Arise, play the Eyes of Texas and Texas Fight at full-freaking blast
6:20 Get in car, drive to New Braunfels
7:30 Tee off (me and a buddy were the FIRST tee-time of the morning)
8:50 Turn 9 (crack open first beer)
8:53 Crack open second beer
8:58 Crack open...(you get the idea)
10:30 Finish 18 (holes, as well as beers), sign scorecard for smoooooth 95
10:35 Headed for San Antonio
10:50 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and post-game festivities
11:10 We decide we don't have enough booze, so we double-back to a liquor
store and buy the good ol' 750 ml plastic bottle "Traveler" Jim Beam
11:50 Arrive at the tailgate spot. Awesome day. Not a single cloud in the
sky. About 70 degrees.
11:55 I decide that we're going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to go fuck himself.
12:15 The UT band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. We're on the second
floor of a two-story parking garage on the corner (a couple hundred of us).
We're hooting and hollering like wildmen. The band doubles back to the
street right below us and serenades us with Texas Fight and The Eyes of
Texas. AWESOME MOMENT.
12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity, 50-100 grown men are bumping chests
with one another, each and every one of them now secure and certain of the
fact that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. Again, we hoot
and holler like wildmen. Again, the band doubles back and stops right below
us to serenade us, this time, however, with the Nebraska fight songs.
*Although somewhat impressed by their spirit and verve, we remain convinced
that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome, somehow managing to stuff the
"Traveler" and 11 cans of beer into my pants.
1:47 I am in line surrounded by Nebraska fans. They are taunting me. I am
taunting back, still certain that we are going to kick the shit out of
Nebraska. I decide to challenge a particularly vocal Nebraska fan to play
 what I now call and will forever be remembered as "Cell-Phone Flop Out."
Remember flop out for a dollar? The rules are similar. I tell this Nebraska
jackass that if he's so confident in his team, he should "flop out" his cell
 phone RIGHT NOW and make plane reservations to Phoenix for the Fiesta
Bowl.
 And then I spoke these memorable words: "And not those damn refundable
tickets, either! You request those non-refundable, non-transferrable
sons-of-bitches!" He backs down. He is unworthy. I call Southwest Airlines
and buy two tickets to Phoenix, non-refundable and non-transferrable. Price:
 $712. He is humbled. He lowers his head in shame. I raise my cell phone in
 triumph to the cheers of hundreds of Texas fans. I am KING and these are my
 subjects. I distribute the 11 beers in my pants to the cheering masses. I
 RULE the pre-game kingdom.
2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence, I open the Traveler and pour my
first stiffy.
2:45 I notice something troubling: Nebraska is big. Nebraska is fast.
Nebraska is very pissed off at Texas.
3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends. 9 yards total offense for Texas.
Zero first downs for Texas. I'm still talking shit. I pour another stiffy
 from the Traveler.
3:36 Four minutes to go in the first half: the Traveler is a dead soldier.

I buy my first $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. While I am standing in
line, a center snap nearly decapitates Major Applewhite and rolls out of the
end zone. Safety.
3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas 0. I wish I had another Traveler.
4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska fan in the bathroom at halftime, I
attempt to revive the classic Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:
"Hey, buddy, niiiiiiiiice cock." He is unamused.
4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. I share my
beer with two high school girls sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they are
equipped with a flask full of vodka. I send them off to purchase Sprites, so
that we may consume their vodka. I have not lost faith.  Nebraska is a bunch
of pussies.
4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting behind me have fled for their lives.

I purchase two more $5 beers from the Alamodome merchants.
5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I am beginning to lose faith. This
normally would trouble me, but I am too drunk to see the football field.
5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: "I'm sorry, sir. Those tickets have been
confirmed and are non-refundable and non-transferrable."
5:37 I try to start a fight with every person behind the concession counter.
As it turns out, the Alamodome has a policy that no beer can be sold when
there is less than 10 minutes on the game clock. I am enraged by this
policy. I ask loudly: "Why the fuck didn't you announce last call over the
fucking PA system??!!"
5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in my chair in defeat. All of a sudden,
the Texas crowd goes absolutely nuts. "Whazzis?," I mutter, awaking from my
coma, "Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?" Alas, the answer is no, we were not
winning and we did not score. The largest (by far) cheer of the day from
the
Texas faithful occurred when the handlers were walking back to the tunnel
and Bevo stopped to take a gargantuan shit all over the letters "S", "K",
and "A" in the "Nebraska" spelled out in their end zone.  I cheer wildly.

I pick up the empty Traveler bottle and stick my tongue in it. I am thirsty.
6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as I walk back to the truck. I would
taunt them with some off-color remarks about their parentage, but I am too
drunk to form complete sentences. With my last cognitive thought of the
evening, I take solace in the fact that if we had not beaten them in
October, they would be playing Florida State for the national
championship.
6:30 Back in the car. On the way back to Austin for the 8:00 Texas-Arizona
tip off. We can still salvage the day! I crack open a beer.  *It is warm.

I don't care.
7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am hungry. I go inside the store. I walk
past the beer frig. I notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I wonder if it's
any good. I pull a Zima from the frig. I twist the top off and drink the
Zima in three swallows. Zima sucks. I replace the empty bottle in the frig.
7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the store. I walk to where the ingredients
are, where the person usually makes the sub. There is no one there. I lean
over the counter and scoop out half a bucket of black olives. I eat them.

I am still hungry. I lean further over the counter and grab approximately
two
pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the store grunting and eating Pastrami.
The patrons in the store fear me. I don't care.
8:01 We are in South Austin. I have been drinking warm beer and singing
Brooks and Dunn tunes for over an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my
singing. He suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn have written other good
songs besides "You're Going to Miss Me When I'm Gone" and "Neon Moon" and
that maybe listening to only those two songs, ten times each was a bit
excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I could just let the CD play on its own.

I tell him to fuck off and restart "Neon Moon."
8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My truckmate, against my loud and
profane protestations, parks on the top floor of a nearby parking garage.

I
tell him he's an idiot. I tell him we will never get out. I tell him we may
as well pitch a fucking tent here. He ignores me. I think he's still pissed
about the Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle "Neon Moon" loudly.
8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers stuffed in my pants. We're going to
kick the shit out of Arizona.
9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona 29. I am pleased. I go to the
bathroom to pee for the 67th time today. I giggle to myself because of the
new opportunity to do "the bathroom Brice." There are no Arizona fans in the
bathroom. I am disappointed. I tell myself (out loud) that I have a
"Niiiiiice cock." No one is amused but me.
9:41 I walk to the bathroom while drinking Bud Light out of a can.  Needless
to say, they do not sell beer at the Erwin Center,much less Bud Light out

of
a can. I am stopped by an usher: "Where did you get that, sir?" I tell him
(no shit): "Oh, the cheerleaders were throwing them up with those little
plastic footballs. Would you mind throwing this away for me?" I take the
last swig and hand it to him. He is confused. I pretend I'm going to the
bathroom, but I run away giggling instead. I duck into some entrance to
avoid the usher, who is now pursuing me. I sneak into a large group of
people and sit down. The usher walks by harmlessly. I am giggling like a
little girl. I crack open another can of Bud Light.
9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid the usher, I have lostmy bearings. I
have no ticket stub. I cannot find my seats. Texas is losing.
10:09 Texas is being screwed by the refs. I am enraged. I have cleared out
the seats around me because I keep removing my hat and beating the
surrounding chairs with it. A concerned fan asks if I'm OK and perhaps I
shouldn't take it so seriously. I tell him to fuck off.
10:15 After the fourth consecutive "worst fucking call I have EVER seen," I
attempt to remove my hat again to begin beating inanimate objects.  However,
on this occasion I miscalculate and I thumbnail myself in my left eyelid,
leaving a one-quarter inch gash over my eye. I am now bleeding into my left
eye and all over my shirt. "Perhaps," I think to myself, "I'm taking this a
bit seriously."
10:22 I am standing in the bathroom peeing. I'm so drunk I am swaying and
grunting. I have a bloody napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants are
bloody. I have my (formerly) white shirt wrapped around my waist. I look
like I should be in an episode of Cops.
10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody white shirt back on my body and make
my way for the exits. I am stopped every 20 seconds by a good
samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me why I am covered in blood, but I
merely grunt incoherently and keep moving.
10:59 With my one good eye, I have located the parking garage. I walk up six
flights of stairs, promise that when I see my friend I will punch him in the
face for making me walk up six flights of stairs, find the truck, and
collapse in a heap in the bed of the truck. I look around and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and

no one is moving. I take a nap.
11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my friend in the driver's seat. I lift my
head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up
all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving.  I
am too tired to punch my friend. I call my friend a "Stupid cocksucker."
11:31 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving. I call my friend a "Stupid cocksucker."
11:38 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving. I call my friend a "Stupid cocksucker."
11:47 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and

no one is moving. I call my friend a "Stupid cocksucker."
11:58 I am jostled. The truck is moving. I lift my head to look out the bed
of the truck and notice that traffic is beginning to move on the second
floor. I jump out of the truck, walk to the edge of the parking facility,
and pee off the sixth floor onto the street below. My friend looks at me
like I just anally violated his minor sister. I turn around and pee on the
front of his truck while singing the lyrics to "Neon Moon."
12:11 We are moving. We are out of beer. I jump from the truck and go from
vehicle to vehicle until someone gives me two beers. I am happy. I return to
my vehicle.
12:26 We have emerged from the parking facility. We make our way to my
apartment and find Ed sitting on the couch with a freshly opened bottle of
Glenlivet on the coffee table in front of him. We are all going to die
tonight.
12:59 We have finished three-quarters of the bottle of Glenlivet. We decide
it would be a wonderful idea to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has to pee.
He walks down the hall to our apartment and directly into the full length
 mirror at the end of the hall, smashing it into hundreds of pieces.  We
giggle uncontrollably and leave for PollyEsther's.
1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs uncontrollably at our efforts to enter
his club. "Fellas," he says in between his fits of spastic laughter, "I've
 been working this door for almost a year. I've been working doors in this
town for almost 5 years. And I can honestly say that I ain't never seen
three drunker mother fuckers than you three. Sorry, can't let you in." We
attempt to reason with him. He laughs harder.
1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We take two steps in the door and hear
"Last call for alcohol!" I turn to the group and mutter: "See, dat wasn't
that fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that at the Awamo...the awaom...the
alab...fuck it, that stadium we was at today..." We order 6 shots of tequila
and three beers.
2:15 Back on the street. We need food. We hail a cab to take us the two and
one half blocks to Katz's. The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10 and tell
him to keep it.
2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give the hostess $50. We are seated
immediately.
2:25 We order two orders of fried pickles, a Cobb salad, a bowl of soup, two
orders of Blueberry blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a hamburger, two cheese
stuffed potatoes, an order of fries, and an order of onion rings.
2:39 The food arrives. We are all asleep with our heads onthe table. The
waiter wakes us up. We eat every fucking bit of our food. Most of the
restaurant patrons around us are disgusted. We don't give a fuck. The tab is
$112 with tip.
2:46 I'm sleepy.
9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman. She is the bartender at Katz's.
She is not pretty.

> > A chronology of events for Saturday, December 4, 1999, and the early
morning
hours of Sunday, December 5, 1999:
6:00 Arise, play the Eyes of Texas and Texas Fight at full-freaking blast
6:20 Get in car, drive to New Braunfels
7:30 Tee off (me and a buddy were the FIRST tee-time of the morning)
8:50 Turn 9 (crack open first beer)
8:53 Crack open second beer
8:58 Crack open...(you get the idea)
10:30 Finish 18 (holes, as well as beers), sign scorecard for smoooooth 95
10:35 Headed for San Antonio
10:50 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and post-game festivities
11:10 We decide we don't have enough booze, so we double-back to a liquor
store and buy the good ol' 750 ml plastic bottle "Traveler" Jim Beam
11:50 Arrive at the tailgate spot. Awesome day. Not a single cloud in the
sky. About 70 degrees.
11:55 I decide that we're going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to go fuck himself.
12:15 The UT band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. We're on the second
floor of a two-story parking garage on the corner (a couple hundred of us).
We're hooting and hollering like wildmen. The band doubles back to the
street right below us and serenades us with Texas Fight and The Eyes of
Texas. AWESOME MOMENT.
12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity, 50-100 grown men are bumping chests
with one another, each and every one of them now secure and certain of the
fact that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. Again, we hoot
and holler like wildmen. Again, the band doubles back and stops right below
us to serenade us, this time, however, with the Nebraska fight songs.
*Although somewhat impressed by their spirit and verve, we remain convinced
that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome, somehow managing to stuff the
"Traveler" and 11 cans of beer into my pants.
1:47 I am in line surrounded by Nebraska fans. They are taunting me. I am
taunting back, still certain that we are going to kick the shit out of
Nebraska. I decide to challenge a particularly vocal Nebraska fan to play
 what I now call and will forever be remembered as "Cell-Phone Flop Out."
Remember flop out for a dollar? The rules are similar. I tell this Nebraska
jackass that if he's so confident in his team, he should "flop out" his cell
 phone RIGHT NOW and make plane reservations to Phoenix for the Fiesta
Bowl.
 And then I spoke these memorable words: "And not those damn refundable
tickets, either! You request those non-refundable, non-transferrable
sons-of-bitches!" He backs down. He is unworthy. I call Southwest Airlines
and buy two tickets to Phoenix, non-refundable and non-transferrable. Price:
 $712. He is humbled. He lowers his head in shame. I raise my cell phone in
 triumph to the cheers of hundreds of Texas fans. I am KING and these are my
 subjects. I distribute the 11 beers in my pants to the cheering masses. I
 RULE the pre-game kingdom.
2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence, I open the Traveler and pour my
first stiffy.
2:45 I notice something troubling: Nebraska is big. Nebraska is fast.
Nebraska is very pissed off at Texas.
3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends. 9 yards total offense for Texas.
Zero first downs for Texas. I'm still talking shit. I pour another stiffy
 from the Traveler.
3:36 Four minutes to go in the first half: the Traveler is a dead soldier.

I buy my first $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. While I am standing in
line, a center snap nearly decapitates Major Applewhite and rolls out of the
end zone. Safety.
3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas 0. I wish I had another Traveler.
4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska fan in the bathroom at halftime, I
attempt to revive the classic Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:
"Hey, buddy, niiiiiiiiice cock." He is unamused.
4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. I share my
beer with two high school girls sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they are
equipped with a flask full of vodka. I send them off to purchase Sprites, so
that we may consume their vodka. I have not lost faith.  Nebraska is a bunch
of pussies.
4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting behind me have fled for their lives.

I purchase two more $5 beers from the Alamodome merchants.
5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I am beginning to lose faith. This
normally would trouble me, but I am too drunk to see the football field.
5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: "I'm sorry, sir. Those tickets have been
confirmed and are non-refundable and non-transferrable."
5:37 I try to start a fight with every person behind the concession counter.
As it turns out, the Alamodome has a policy that no beer can be sold when
there is less than 10 minutes on the game clock. I am enraged by this
policy. I ask loudly: "Why the fuck didn't you announce last call over the
fucking PA system??!!"
5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in my chair in defeat. All of a sudden,
the Texas crowd goes absolutely nuts. "Whazzis?," I mutter, awaking from my
coma, "Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?" Alas, the answer is no, we were not
winning and we did not score. The largest (by far) cheer of the day from
the
Texas faithful occurred when the handlers were walking back to the tunnel
and Bevo stopped to take a gargantuan shit all over the letters "S", "K",
and "A" in the "Nebraska" spelled out in their end zone.  I cheer wildly.

I pick up the empty Traveler bottle and stick my tongue in it. I am thirsty.
6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as I walk back to the truck. I would
taunt them with some off-color remarks about their parentage, but I am too
drunk to form complete sentences. With my last cognitive thought of the
evening, I take solace in the fact that if we had not beaten them in
October, they would be playing Florida State for the national
championship.
6:30 Back in the car. On the way back to Austin for the 8:00 Texas-Arizona
tip off. We can still salvage the day! I crack open a beer.  *It is warm.

I don't care.
7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am hungry. I go inside the store. I walk
past the beer frig. I notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I wonder if it's
any good. I pull a Zima from the frig. I twist the top off and drink the
Zima in three swallows. Zima sucks. I replace the empty bottle in the frig.
7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the store. I walk to where the ingredients
are, where the person usually makes the sub. There is no one there. I lean
over the counter and scoop out half a bucket of black olives. I eat them.

I am still hungry. I lean further over the counter and grab approximately
two
pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the store grunting and eating Pastrami.
The patrons in the store fear me. I don't care.
8:01 We are in South Austin. I have been drinking warm beer and singing
Brooks and Dunn tunes for over an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my
singing. He suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn have written other good
songs besides "You're Going to Miss Me When I'm Gone" and "Neon Moon" and
that maybe listening to only those two songs, ten times each was a bit
excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I could just let the CD play on its own.

I tell him to fuck off and restart "Neon Moon."
8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My truckmate, against my loud and
profane protestations, parks on the top floor of a nearby parking garage.

I
tell him he's an idiot. I tell him we will never get out. I tell him we may
as well pitch a fucking tent here. He ignores me. I think he's still pissed
about the Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle "Neon Moon" loudly.
8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers stuffed in my pants. We're going to
kick the shit out of Arizona.
9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona 29. I am pleased. I go to the
bathroom to pee for the 67th time today. I giggle to myself because of the
new opportunity to do "the bathroom Brice." There are no Arizona fans in the
bathroom. I am disappointed. I tell myself (out loud) that I have a
"Niiiiiice cock." No one is amused but me.
9:41 I walk to the bathroom while drinking Bud Light out of a can.  Needless
to say, they do not sell beer at the Erwin Center,much less Bud Light out

of
a can. I am stopped by an usher: "Where did you get that, sir?" I tell him
(no shit): "Oh, the cheerleaders were throwing them up with those little
plastic footballs. Would you mind throwing this away for me?" I take the
last swig and hand it to him. He is confused. I pretend I'm going to the
bathroom, but I run away giggling instead. I duck into some entrance to
avoid the usher, who is now pursuing me. I sneak into a large group of
people and sit down. The usher walks by harmlessly. I am giggling like a
little girl. I crack open another can of Bud Light.
9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid the usher, I have lostmy bearings. I
have no ticket stub. I cannot find my seats. Texas is losing.
10:09 Texas is being screwed by the refs. I am enraged. I have cleared out
the seats around me because I keep removing my hat and beating the
surrounding chairs with it. A concerned fan asks if I'm OK and perhaps I
shouldn't take it so seriously. I tell him to fuck off.
10:15 After the fourth consecutive "worst fucking call I have EVER seen," I
attempt to remove my hat again to begin beating inanimate objects.  However,
on this occasion I miscalculate and I thumbnail myself in my left eyelid,
leaving a one-quarter inch gash over my eye. I am now bleeding into my left
eye and all over my shirt. "Perhaps," I think to myself, "I'm taking this a
bit seriously."
10:22 I am standing in the bathroom peeing. I'm so drunk I am swaying and
grunting. I have a bloody napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants are
bloody. I have my (formerly) white shirt wrapped around my waist. I look
like I should be in an episode of Cops.
10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody white shirt back on my body and make
my way for the exits. I am stopped every 20 seconds by a good
samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me why I am covered in blood, but I
merely grunt incoherently and keep moving.
10:59 With my one good eye, I have located the parking garage. I walk up six
flights of stairs, promise that when I see my friend I will punch him in the
face for making me walk up six flights of stairs, find the truck, and
collapse in a heap in the bed of the truck. I look around and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and

no one is moving. I take a nap.
11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my friend in the driver's seat. I lift my
head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up
all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving.  I
am too tired to punch my friend. I call my friend a "Stupid cocksucker."
11:31 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving. I call my friend a "Stupid cocksucker."
11:38 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving. I call my friend a "Stupid cocksucker."
11:47 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and

no one is moving. I call my friend a "Stupid cocksucker."
11:58 I am jostled. The truck is moving. I lift my head to look out the bed
of the truck and notice that traffic is beginning to move on the second
floor. I jump out of the truck, walk to the edge of the parking facility,
and pee off the sixth floor onto the street below. My friend looks at me
like I just anally violated his minor sister. I turn around and pee on the
front of his truck while singing the lyrics to "Neon Moon."
12:11 We are moving. We are out of beer. I jump from the truck and go from
vehicle to vehicle until someone gives me two beers. I am happy. I return to
my vehicle.
12:26 We have emerged from the parking facility. We make our way to my
apartment and find Ed sitting on the couch with a freshly opened bottle of
Glenlivet on the coffee table in front of him. We are all going to die
tonight.
12:59 We have finished three-quarters of the bottle of Glenlivet. We decide
it would be a wonderful idea to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has to pee.
He walks down the hall to our apartment and directly into the full length
 mirror at the end of the hall, smashing it into hundreds of pieces.  We
giggle uncontrollably and leave for PollyEsther's.
1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs uncontrollably at our efforts to enter
his club. "Fellas," he says in between his fits of spastic laughter, "I've
 been working this door for almost a year. I've been working doors in this
town for almost 5 years. And I can honestly say that I ain't never seen
three drunker mother fuckers than you three. Sorry, can't let you in." We
attempt to reason with him. He laughs harder.
1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We take two steps in the door and hear
"Last call for alcohol!" I turn to the group and mutter: "See, dat wasn't
that fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that at the Awamo...the awaom...the
alab...fuck it, that stadium we was at today..." We order 6 shots of tequila
and three beers.
2:15 Back on the street. We need food. We hail a cab to take us the two and
one half blocks to Katz's. The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10 and tell
him to keep it.
2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give the hostess $50. We are seated
immediately.
2:25 We order two orders of fried pickles, a Cobb salad, a bowl of soup, two
orders of Blueberry blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a hamburger, two cheese
stuffed potatoes, an order of fries, and an order of onion rings.
2:39 The food arrives. We are all asleep with our heads onthe table. The
waiter wakes us up. We eat every fucking bit of our food. Most of the
restaurant patrons around us are disgusted. We don't give a fuck. The tab is
$112 with tip.
2:46 I'm sleepy.
9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman. She is the bartender at Katz's.
She is not pretty.

morning
hours of Sunday, December 5, 1999:
6:00 Arise, play the Eyes of Texas and Texas Fight at full-freaking blast
6:20 Get in car, drive to New Braunfels
7:30 Tee off (me and a buddy were the FIRST tee-time of the morning)
8:50 Turn 9 (crack open first beer)
8:53 Crack open second beer
8:58 Crack open...(you get the idea)
10:30 Finish 18 (holes, as well as beers), sign scorecard for smoooooth 95
10:35 Headed for San Antonio
10:50 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and post-game festivities
11:10 We decide we don't have enough booze, so we double-back to a liquor
store and buy the good ol' 750 ml plastic bottle "Traveler" Jim Beam
11:50 Arrive at the tailgate spot. Awesome day. Not a single cloud in the
sky. About 70 degrees.
11:55 I decide that we're going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to go fuck himself.
12:15 The UT band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. We're on the second
floor of a two-story parking garage on the corner (a couple hundred of us).
We're hooting and hollering like wildmen. The band doubles back to the
street right below us and serenades us with Texas Fight and The Eyes of
Texas. AWESOME MOMENT.
12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity, 50-100 grown men are bumping chests
with one another, each and every one of them now secure and certain of the
fact that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. Again, we hoot
and holler like wildmen. Again, the band doubles back and stops right below
us to serenade us, this time, however, with the Nebraska fight songs.
*Although somewhat impressed by their spirit and verve, we remain convinced
that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome, somehow managing to stuff the
"Traveler" and 11 cans of beer into my pants.
1:47 I am in line surrounded by Nebraska fans. They are taunting me. I am
taunting back, still certain that we are going to kick the shit out of
Nebraska. I decide to challenge a particularly vocal Nebraska fan to play
 what I now call and will forever be remembered as "Cell-Phone Flop Out."
Remember flop out for a dollar? The rules are similar. I tell this Nebraska
jackass that if he's so confident in his team, he should "flop out" his cell
 phone RIGHT NOW and make plane reservations to Phoenix for the Fiesta
Bowl.
 And then I spoke these memorable words: "And not those damn refundable
tickets, either! You request those non-refundable, non-transferrable
sons-of-bitches!" He backs down. He is unworthy. I call Southwest Airlines
and buy two tickets to Phoenix, non-refundable and non-transferrable. Price:
 $712. He is humbled. He lowers his head in shame. I raise my cell phone in
 triumph to the cheers of hundreds of Texas fans. I am KING and these are my
 subjects. I distribute the 11 beers in my pants to the cheering masses. I
 RULE the pre-game kingdom.
2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence, I open the Traveler and pour my
first stiffy.
2:45 I notice something troubling: Nebraska is big. Nebraska is fast.
Nebraska is very pissed off at Texas.
3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends. 9 yards total offense for Texas.
Zero first downs for Texas. I'm still talking shit. I pour another stiffy
 from the Traveler.
3:36 Four minutes to go in the first half: the Traveler is a dead soldier.

I buy my first $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. While I am standing in
line, a center snap nearly decapitates Major Applewhite and rolls out of the
end zone. Safety.
3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas 0. I wish I had another Traveler.
4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska fan in the bathroom at halftime, I
attempt to revive the classic Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:
"Hey, buddy, niiiiiiiiice cock." He is unamused.
4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. I share my
beer with two high school girls sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they are
equipped with a flask full of vodka. I send them off to purchase Sprites, so
that we may consume their vodka. I have not lost faith.  Nebraska is a bunch
of pussies.
4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting behind me have fled for their lives.

I purchase two more $5 beers from the Alamodome merchants.
5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I am beginning to lose faith. This
normally would trouble me, but I am too drunk to see the football field.
5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: "I'm sorry, sir. Those tickets have been
confirmed and are non-refundable and non-transferrable."
5:37 I try to start a fight with every person behind the concession counter.
As it turns out, the Alamodome has a policy that no beer can be sold when
there is less than 10 minutes on the game clock. I am enraged by this
policy. I ask loudly: "Why the fuck didn't you announce last call over the
fucking PA system??!!"
5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in my chair in defeat. All of a sudden,
the Texas crowd goes absolutely nuts. "Whazzis?," I mutter, awaking from my
coma, "Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?" Alas, the answer is no, we were not
winning and we did not score. The largest (by far) cheer of the day from
the
Texas faithful occurred when the handlers were walking back to the tunnel
and Bevo stopped to take a gargantuan shit all over the letters "S", "K",
and "A" in the "Nebraska" spelled out in their end zone.  I cheer wildly.

I pick up the empty Traveler bottle and stick my tongue in it. I am thirsty.
6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as I walk back to the truck. I would
taunt them with some off-color remarks about their parentage, but I am too
drunk to form complete sentences. With my last cognitive thought of the
evening, I take solace in the fact that if we had not beaten them in
October, they would be playing Florida State for the national
championship.
6:30 Back in the car. On the way back to Austin for the 8:00 Texas-Arizona
tip off. We can still salvage the day! I crack open a beer.  *It is warm.

I don't care.
7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am hungry. I go inside the store. I walk
past the beer frig. I notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I wonder if it's
any good. I pull a Zima from the frig. I twist the top off and drink the
Zima in three swallows. Zima sucks. I replace the empty bottle in the frig.
7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the store. I walk to where the ingredients
are, where the person usually makes the sub. There is no one there. I lean
over the counter and scoop out half a bucket of black olives. I eat them.

I am still hungry. I lean further over the counter and grab approximately
two
pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the store grunting and eating Pastrami.
The patrons in the store fear me. I don't care.
8:01 We are in South Austin. I have been drinking warm beer and singing
Brooks and Dunn tunes for over an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my
singing. He suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn have written other good
songs besides "You're Going to Miss Me When I'm Gone" and "Neon Moon" and
that maybe listening to only those two songs, ten times each was a bit
excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I could just let the CD play on its own.

I tell him to fuck off and restart "Neon Moon."
8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My truckmate, against my loud and
profane protestations, parks on the top floor of a nearby parking garage.

I
tell him he's an idiot. I tell him we will never get out. I tell him we may
as well pitch a fucking tent here. He ignores me. I think he's still pissed
about the Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle "Neon Moon" loudly.
8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers stuffed in my pants. We're going to
kick the shit out of Arizona.
9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona 29. I am pleased. I go to the
bathroom to pee for the 67th time today. I giggle to myself because of the
new opportunity to do "the bathroom Brice." There are no Arizona fans in the
bathroom. I am disappointed. I tell myself (out loud) that I have a
"Niiiiiice cock." No one is amused but me.
9:41 I walk to the bathroom while drinking Bud Light out of a can.  Needless
to say, they do not sell beer at the Erwin Center,much less Bud Light out

of
a can. I am stopped by an usher: "Where did you get that, sir?" I tell him
(no shit): "Oh, the cheerleaders were throwing them up with those little
plastic footballs. Would you mind throwing this away for me?" I take the
last swig and hand it to him. He is confused. I pretend I'm going to the
bathroom, but I run away giggling instead. I duck into some entrance to
avoid the usher, who is now pursuing me. I sneak into a large group of
people and sit down. The usher walks by harmlessly. I am giggling like a
little girl. I crack open another can of Bud Light.
9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid the usher, I have lostmy bearings. I
have no ticket stub. I cannot find my seats. Texas is losing.
10:09 Texas is being screwed by the refs. I am enraged. I have cleared out
the seats around me because I keep removing my hat and beating the
surrounding chairs with it. A concerned fan asks if I'm OK and perhaps I
shouldn't take it so seriously. I tell him to fuck off.
10:15 After the fourth consecutive "worst fucking call I have EVER seen," I
attempt to remove my hat again to begin beating inanimate objects.  However,
on this occasion I miscalculate and I thumbnail myself in my left eyelid,
leaving a one-quarter inch gash over my eye. I am now bleeding into my left
eye and all over my shirt. "Perhaps," I think to myself, "I'm taking this a
bit seriously."
10:22 I am standing in the bathroom peeing. I'm so drunk I am swaying and
grunting. I have a bloody napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants are
bloody. I have my (formerly) white shirt wrapped around my waist. I look
like I should be in an episode of Cops.
10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody white shirt back on my body and make
my way for the exits. I am stopped every 20 seconds by a good
samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me why I am covered in blood, but I
merely grunt incoherently and keep moving.
10:59 With my one good eye, I have located the parking garage. I walk up six
flights of stairs, promise that when I see my friend I will punch him in the
face for making me walk up six flights of stairs, find the truck, and
collapse in a heap in the bed of the truck. I look around and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and

no one is moving. I take a nap.
11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my friend in the driver's seat. I lift my
head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up
all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving.  I
am too tired to punch my friend. I call my friend a "Stupid cocksucker."
11:31 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving. I call my friend a "Stupid cocksucker."
11:38 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving. I call my friend a "Stupid cocksucker."
11:47 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and

no one is moving. I call my friend a "Stupid cocksucker."
11:58 I am jostled. The truck is moving. I lift my head to look out the bed
of the truck and notice that traffic is beginning to move on the second
floor. I jump out of the truck, walk to the edge of the parking facility,
and pee off the sixth floor onto the street below. My friend looks at me
like I just anally violated his minor sister. I turn around and pee on the
front of his truck while singing the lyrics to "Neon Moon."
12:11 We are moving. We are out of beer. I jump from the truck and go from
vehicle to vehicle until someone gives me two beers. I am happy. I return to
my vehicle.
12:26 We have emerged from the parking facility. We make our way to my
apartment and find Ed sitting on the couch with a freshly opened bottle of
Glenlivet on the coffee table in front of him. We are all going to die
tonight.
12:59 We have finished three-quarters of the bottle of Glenlivet. We decide
it would be a wonderful idea to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has to pee.
He walks down the hall to our apartment and directly into the full length
 mirror at the end of the hall, smashing it into hundreds of pieces.  We
giggle uncontrollably and leave for PollyEsther's.
1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs uncontrollably at our efforts to enter
his club. "Fellas," he says in between his fits of spastic laughter, "I've
 been working this door for almost a year. I've been working doors in this
town for almost 5 years. And I can honestly say that I ain't never seen
three drunker mother fuckers than you three. Sorry, can't let you in." We
attempt to reason with him. He laughs harder.
1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We take two steps in the door and hear
"Last call for alcohol!" I turn to the group and mutter: "See, dat wasn't
that fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that at the Awamo...the awaom...the
alab...fuck it, that stadium we was at today..." We order 6 shots of tequila
and three beers.
2:15 Back on the street. We need food. We hail a cab to take us the two and
one half blocks to Katz's. The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10 and tell
him to keep it.
2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give the hostess $50. We are seated
immediately.
2:25 We order two orders of fried pickles, a Cobb salad, a bowl of soup, two
orders of Blueberry blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a hamburger, two cheese
stuffed potatoes, an order of fries, and an order of onion rings.
2:39 The food arrives. We are all asleep with our heads onthe table. The
waiter wakes us up. We eat every fucking bit of our food. Most of the
restaurant patrons around us are disgusted. We don't give a fuck. The tab is
$112 with tip.
2:46 I'm sleepy.
9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman. She is the bartender at Katz's.
She is not pretty.

> > A chronology of events for Saturday, December 4, 1999, and the early
morning
hours of Sunday, December 5, 1999:
6:00 Arise, play the Eyes of Texas and Texas Fight at full-freaking blast
6:20 Get in car, drive to New Braunfels
7:30 Tee off (me and a buddy were the FIRST tee-time of the morning)
8:50 Turn 9 (crack open first beer)
8:53 Crack open second beer
8:58 Crack open...(you get the idea)
10:30 Finish 18 (holes, as well as beers), sign scorecard for smoooooth 95
10:35 Headed for San Antonio
10:50 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and post-game festivities
11:10 We decide we don't have enough booze, so we double-back to a liquor
store and buy the good ol' 750 ml plastic bottle "Traveler" Jim Beam
11:50 Arrive at the tailgate spot. Awesome day. Not a single cloud in the
sky. About 70 degrees.
11:55 I decide that we're going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to go fuck himself.
12:15 The UT band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. We're on the second
floor of a two-story parking garage on the corner (a couple hundred of us).
We're hooting and hollering like wildmen. The band doubles back to the
street right below us and serenades us with Texas Fight and The Eyes of
Texas. AWESOME MOMENT.
12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity, 50-100 grown men are bumping chests
with one another, each and every one of them now secure and certain of the
fact that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. Again, we hoot
and holler like wildmen. Again, the band doubles back and stops right below
us to serenade us, this time, however, with the Nebraska fight songs.
*Although somewhat impressed by their spirit and verve, we remain convinced
that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome, somehow managing to stuff the
"Traveler" and 11 cans of beer into my pants.
1:47 I am in line surrounded by Nebraska fans. They are taunting me. I am
taunting back, still certain that we are going to kick the shit out of
Nebraska. I decide to challenge a particularly vocal Nebraska fan to play
 what I now call and will forever be remembered as "Cell-Phone Flop Out."
Remember flop out for a dollar? The rules are similar. I tell this Nebraska
jackass that if he's so confident in his team, he should "flop out" his cell
 phone RIGHT NOW and make plane reservations to Phoenix for the Fiesta
Bowl.
 And then I spoke these memorable words: "And not those damn refundable
tickets, either! You request those non-refundable, non-transferrable
sons-of-bitches!" He backs down. He is unworthy. I call Southwest Airlines
and buy two tickets to Phoenix, non-refundable and non-transferrable. Price:
 $712. He is humbled. He lowers his head in shame. I raise my cell phone in
 triumph to the cheers of hundreds of Texas fans. I am KING and these are my
 subjects. I distribute the 11 beers in my pants to the cheering masses. I
 RULE the pre-game kingdom.
2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence, I open the Traveler and pour my
first stiffy.
2:45 I notice something troubling: Nebraska is big. Nebraska is fast.
Nebraska is very pissed off at Texas.
3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends. 9 yards total offense for Texas.
Zero first downs for Texas. I'm still talking shit. I pour another stiffy
 from the Traveler.
3:36 Four minutes to go in the first half: the Traveler is a dead soldier.

I buy my first $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. While I am standing in
line, a center snap nearly decapitates Major Applewhite and rolls out of the
end zone. Safety.
3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas 0. I wish I had another Traveler.
4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska fan in the bathroom at halftime, I
attempt to revive the classic Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:
"Hey, buddy, niiiiiiiiice cock." He is unamused.
4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. I share my
beer with two high school girls sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they are
equipped with a flask full of vodka. I send them off to purchase Sprites, so
that we may consume their vodka. I have not lost faith.  Nebraska is a bunch
of pussies.
4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting behind me have fled for their lives.

I purchase two more $5 beers from the Alamodome merchants.
5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I am beginning to lose faith. This
normally would trouble me, but I am too drunk to see the football field.
5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: "I'm sorry, sir. Those tickets have been
confirmed and are non-refundable and non-transferrable."
5:37 I try to start a fight with every person behind the concession counter.
As it turns out, the Alamodome has a policy that no beer can be sold when
there is less than 10 minutes on the game clock. I am enraged by this
policy. I ask loudly: "Why the fuck didn't you announce last call over the
fucking PA system??!!"
5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in my chair in defeat. All of a sudden,
the Texas crowd goes absolutely nuts. "Whazzis?," I mutter, awaking from my
coma, "Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?" Alas, the answer is no, we were not
winning and we did not score. The largest (by far) cheer of the day from
the
Texas faithful occurred when the handlers were walking back to the tunnel
and Bevo stopped to take a gargantuan shit all over the letters "S", "K",
and "A" in the "Nebraska" spelled out in their end zone.  I cheer wildly.

I pick up the empty Traveler bottle and stick my tongue in it. I am thirsty.
6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as I walk back to the truck. I would
taunt them with some off-color remarks about their parentage, but I am too
drunk to form complete sentences. With my last cognitive thought of the
evening, I take solace in the fact that if we had not beaten them in
October, they would be playing Florida State for the national
championship.
6:30 Back in the car. On the way back to Austin for the 8:00 Texas-Arizona
tip off. We can still salvage the day! I crack open a beer.  *It is warm.

I don't care.
7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am hungry. I go inside the store. I walk
past the beer frig. I notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I wonder if it's
any good. I pull a Zima from the frig. I twist the top off and drink the
Zima in three swallows. Zima sucks. I replace the empty bottle in the frig.
7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the store. I walk to where the ingredients
are, where the person usually makes the sub. There is no one there. I lean
over the counter and scoop out half a bucket of black olives. I eat them.

I am still hungry. I lean further over the counter and grab approximately
two
pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the store grunting and eating Pastrami.
The patrons in the store fear me. I don't care.
8:01 We are in South Austin. I have been drinking warm beer and singing
Brooks and Dunn tunes for over an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my
singing. He suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn have written other good
songs besides "You're Going to Miss Me When I'm Gone" and "Neon Moon" and
that maybe listening to only those two songs, ten times each was a bit
excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I could just let the CD play on its own.

I tell him to fuck off and restart "Neon Moon."
8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My truckmate, against my loud and
profane protestations, parks on the top floor of a nearby parking garage.

I
tell him he's an idiot. I tell him we will never get out. I tell him we may
as well pitch a fucking tent here. He ignores me. I think he's still pissed
about the Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle "Neon Moon" loudly.
8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers stuffed in my pants. We're going to
kick the shit out of Arizona.
9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona 29. I am pleased. I go to the
bathroom to pee for the 67th time today. I giggle to myself because of the
new opportunity to do "the bathroom Brice." There are no Arizona fans in the
bathroom. I am disappointed. I tell myself (out loud) that I have a
"Niiiiiice cock." No one is amused but me.
9:41 I walk to the bathroom while drinking Bud Light out of a can.  Needless
to say, they do not sell beer at the Erwin Center,much less Bud Light out

of
a can. I am stopped by an usher: "Where did you get that, sir?" I tell him
(no shit): "Oh, the cheerleaders were throwing them up with those little
plastic footballs. Would you mind throwing this away for me?" I take the
last swig and hand it to him. He is confused. I pretend I'm going to the
bathroom, but I run away giggling instead. I duck into some entrance to
avoid the usher, who is now pursuing me. I sneak into a large group of
people and sit down. The usher walks by harmlessly. I am giggling like a
little girl. I crack open another can of Bud Light.
9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid the usher, I have lostmy bearings. I
have no ticket stub. I cannot find my seats. Texas is losing.
10:09 Texas is being screwed by the refs. I am enraged. I have cleared out
the seats around me because I keep removing my hat and beating the
surrounding chairs with it. A concerned fan asks if I'm OK and perhaps I
shouldn't take it so seriously. I tell him to fuck off.
10:15 After the fourth consecutive "worst fucking call I have EVER seen," I
attempt to remove my hat again to begin beating inanimate objects.  However,
on this occasion I miscalculate and I thumbnail myself in my left eyelid,
leaving a one-quarter inch gash over my eye. I am now bleeding into my left
eye and all over my shirt. "Perhaps," I think to myself, "I'm taking this a
bit seriously."
10:22 I am standing in the bathroom peeing. I'm so drunk I am swaying and
grunting. I have a bloody napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants are
bloody. I have my (formerly) white shirt wrapped around my waist. I look
like I should be in an episode of Cops.
10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody white shirt back on my body and make
my way for the exits. I am stopped every 20 seconds by a good
samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me why I am covered in blood, but I
merely grunt incoherently and keep moving.
10:59 With my one good eye, I have located the parking garage. I walk up six
flights of stairs, promise that when I see my friend I will punch him in the
face for making me walk up six flights of stairs, find the truck, and
collapse in a heap in the bed of the truck. I look around and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and

no one is moving. I take a nap.
11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my friend in the driver's seat. I lift my
head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up
all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving.  I
am too tired to punch my friend. I call my friend a "Stupid cocksucker."
11:31 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving. I call my friend a "Stupid cocksucker."
11:38 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving. I call my friend a "Stupid cocksucker."
11:47 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and

no one is moving. I call my friend a "Stupid cocksucker."
11:58 I am jostled. The truck is moving. I lift my head to look out the bed
of the truck and notice that traffic is beginning to move on the second
floor. I jump out of the truck, walk to the edge of the parking facility,
and pee off the sixth floor onto the street below. My friend looks at me
like I just anally violated his minor sister. I turn around and pee on the
front of his truck while singing the lyrics to "Neon Moon."
12:11 We are moving. We are out of beer. I jump from the truck and go from
vehicle to vehicle until someone gives me two beers. I am happy. I return to
my vehicle.
12:26 We have emerged from the parking facility. We make our way to my
apartment and find Ed sitting on the couch with a freshly opened bottle of
Glenlivet on the coffee table in front of him. We are all going to die
tonight.
12:59 We have finished three-quarters of the bottle of Glenlivet. We decide
it would be a wonderful idea to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has to pee.
He walks down the hall to our apartment and directly into the full length
 mirror at the end of the hall, smashing it into hundreds of pieces.  We
giggle uncontrollably and leave for PollyEsther's.
1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs uncontrollably at our efforts to enter
his club. "Fellas," he says in between his fits of spastic laughter, "I've
 been working this door for almost a year. I've been working doors in this
town for almost 5 years. And I can honestly say that I ain't never seen
three drunker mother fuckers than you three. Sorry, can't let you in." We
attempt to reason with him. He laughs harder.
1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We take two steps in the door and hear
"Last call for alcohol!" I turn to the group and mutter: "See, dat wasn't
that fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that at the Awamo...the awaom...the
alab...fuck it, that stadium we was at today..." We order 6 shots of tequila
and three beers.
2:15 Back on the street. We need food. We hail a cab to take us the two and
one half blocks to Katz's. The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10 and tell
him to keep it.
2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give the hostess $50. We are seated
immediately.
2:25 We order two orders of fried pickles, a Cobb salad, a bowl of soup, two
orders of Blueberry blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a hamburger, two cheese
stuffed potatoes, an order of fries, and an order of onion rings.
2:39 The food arrives. We are all asleep with our heads onthe table. The
waiter wakes us up. We eat every fucking bit of our food. Most of the
restaurant patrons around us are disgusted. We don't give a fuck. The tab is
$112 with tip.
2:46 I'm sleepy.
9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman. She is the bartender at Katz's.
She is not pretty.

Hi Mark,

David got home tonight and told me the fun you guys had in Seattle.? The snow 
shoe hike sounded like a good work out and fun too, but I'm sure I wouldn't 
have made it as smoothly as the rest of you.? I'm so fucking fat and I'm 
determined to get back in the shape that I should be and the way I was most 
of my life!? I've got to start working out on a consistent basis.? David said 
that if I don't the family is going to have a FAT intervention on me!!!

By the way, a note about Cita.? I can't even begin to tell you how much she 
loves you and since Bill left us she's even looking at you as a spiritual 
replacement of him.? Now I'm not saying that she doesn't love Angela as much, 
but Cita has a bond with the boys in our family (Kevin, Donald, Steve) in a 
totally different way as she does with the girls!!? I can't explain why (I've 
got my theories) but she just does.? 

Anyway, I was visiting her on Monday and she was really distraught about the 
last conversation she had with you over the phone while you were at Jorge's 
house.? She said that she felt that you misunderstood what she meant when she 
said that Bill was stupid.? I'm sure you know what she meant by it as far as 
him not wanting to change his life style (drinking & smoking), but she felt 
that you got mad at her for calling him stupid.? Her biggest consern is that 
she feels for that reason you probably won't want to talk to her again or 
much at all!!? I did tell her that you are a dick but that you're not that 
big of a dick!!? Regardless, we all know that you're a?prick anyway, but 
could you please give her a call sometime soon just to put her mind at ease?? 
You don't have to mention the "stupid" word or conversation, just call her to 
say hi and that you miss her more than she misses you!? Don't tell her that I 
emailed you about! my conversation with her.? Otherwise she'll just say "what 
the fuck is an email?"

Looking forward to seeing you later this month.(the 23rd)? Also, I want you 
to know that you're really not a prick, your a dickhead!

As always - with way more love than you deserve,? Uncle (fat) Bobby!!!

>>>> 9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid the usher, I have lost my bearings. 
I

>>>>
>>>> 10:09 Texas is being screwed by the refs. I am enraged. I have cleared 
out

However,

a

my

from

This is long but it's damn funny. Just keep reading.
I'd love to know who wrote it. Goose, did you pen this?



>> >>>> >>A chronology of events for Saturday, December 4, 1999, and the
early
>> >>morning hours of Sunday, December 5, 1999:
>> >>
>> >>6:00  Arise, play the Eyes of Texas and Texas Fight at full-freaking
blast
>> >>
>> >>6:20  Get in car, drive to New Braunfels
>> >>
>> >>7:30  Tee off (me and a buddy were the FIRST tee-time of the morning)
>> >>
>> >>8:50  Turn 9 (crack open first beer)
>> >>
>> >>8:53  Crack open second beer
>> >>
>> >>8:58  Crack open...(you get the idea)
>> >>
>> >>10:30  Finish 18 (holes, as well as beers), sign scorecard for
smoooooth 95
>> >>
>> >>10:35  Headed for San Antonio
>> >>
>> >>10:50  Buy three 18-packs for pre- and post-game festivities
>> >>
>> >>11:10  We decide we don't have enough booze, so we double-back to a
liquor
>> >>store and buy the good ol' 750 ml plastic bottle "Traveler" Jim Beam
>> >>
>> >>11:50  Arrive at the tailgate spot.  Awesome day.  Not a single cloud
in
>> >>the sky.  About 70 degrees.
>> >>
>> >>11:55  I decide that we're going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
>> >>
>> >>11:56  I tell my first Nebraska fan to go fuck himself.
>> >>
>> >>12:15  The UT band walks by on the way to the Alamodome.  We're on the
>> >>second floor of a two-story parking garage on the corner (a couple
hundred
>> >>of us).  We're hooting and hollering like wildmen.  The band doubles
back
>> >>to the street right below us and serenades us with Texas Fight and The
Eyes
>> >>of Texas.  AWESOME MOMENT.
>> >>
>> >>12:25  In the post-serenade serendipity, 50-100 grown men are bumping
>> >>chests with one another, each and every one of them now secure and
certain
>> >>of the fact that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
>> >>
>> >>1:00  The Nebraska band walks by on the way to the Alamodome.  Again,
we
>> >>hoot and holler like wildmen.  Again, the band doubles back and stops
right
>> >>below us to serenade us, this time, however, with the Nebraska fight
songs.
>> >>  Although somewhat impressed by their spirit and verve, we remain
>> >>convinced that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
>> >>
>> >>1:30  I begin the walk to the Alamodome, somehow managing to stuff the
>> >>"Traveler" and 11 cans of beer into my pants.
>> >>
>> >>1:47  I am in line surrounded by Nebraska fans.  They are taunting me.
I
>> >>am taunting back, still certain that we are going to kick the shit out
of
>> >>Nebraska.  I decide to challenge a particularly vocal Nebraska fan to
play
>> >>what I now call and will forever be remembered as "Cell-Phone Flop
Out."
>> >>Remember flop out for a dollar?  The rules are similar.  I tell this
>> >>Nebraska jackass that if he's so confident in his team, he should "flop
>> >>out" his cell phone RIGHT NOW and make plane reservations to Phoenix
for
>> >>the Fiesta Bowl.   And then I spoke these memorable words:  "And not
those
>> >>damn refundable tickets, either!  You request those non-refundable,
>> >>non-transferrable sons-of-bitches!"   He backs down.  He is unworthy.
I
>> >>call Southwest Airlines and buy two tickets to Phoenix, non-refundable
and
>> >>non-transferrable.  Price:  $712.  He is humbled.  He lowers his head
in
>> >>shame.  I raise my cell phone in triumph to the cheers of hundreds of
Texas
>> >>fans. I am KING and these are my subjects.  I distribute the 11 beers
in my
>> >>pants to the cheering masses.  I RULE the pre-game kingdom.
>> >>
>> >>2:34  Kickoff.  Brimming with confidence, I open the Traveler and pour
my
>> >>first stiffy.
>> >>
>> >>2:45  I notice something troubling:  Nebraska is big.  Nebraska is
fast.
>> >>Nebraska is very pissed off at Texas.
>> >>
>> >>3:01  The first quarter mercifully ends.  9 yards total offense for
Texas.
>> >>Zero first downs for Texas.  I'm still talking shit.  I pour another
stiffy
>> >>from the Traveler.
>> >>
>> >>3:36  Four minutes to go in the first half:  the Traveler is a dead
>> >>soldier.  I buy my first $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants.  While I
am
>> >>standing in line, a center snap nearly decapitates Major Applewhite and
>> >>rolls out of the end zone.  Safety.
>> >>
>> >>3:56  Halftime score:  Nebraska 15, Texas 0.  I wish I had another
>> >>Traveler.
>> >>
>> >>4:11  While urinating next to a Nebraska fan in the bathroom at
halftime, I
>> >>attempt to revive the classic Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:
>> >>"Hey, buddy, niiiiiiiiice cock."  He is unamused.
>> >>
>> >>4:21  I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants.  I
share
>> >>my beer with two high school girls sitting behind me.  Surprisingly,
they
>> >>are equipped with a flask full of vodka.  I send them off to purchase
$5
>> >>Sprites, so that we may consume their vodka.  I have not lost faith.
>> >>Nebraska is a bunch of pussies.
>> >>
>> >>4:51  No more vodka.  The girls sitting behind me have fled for their
>> >>lives.  I purchase two more $5 beers from the Alamodome merchants.
>> >>
>> >>5:18  Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0.  I am beginning to lose faith.
This
>> >>normally would trouble me, but I am too drunk to see the football
field.
>> >>
>> >>5:27  I call Southwest Airlines:  "I'm sorry, sir.  Those tickets have
been
>> >>confirmed and are non-refundable and non-transferrable."
>> >>
>> >>5:37  I try to start a fight with every person behind the concession
>> >>counter.  As it turns out, the Alamodome has a policy that no beer can
be
>> >>sold when there is less than 10 minutes on the game clock.  I am
enraged by
>> >>this policy.  I ask loudly:  "Why the fuck didn't you announce last
call
>> >>over the fucking PA system??!!"
>> >>
>> >>5:49  Back in my seats, I am slumped in my chair in defeat.  All of a
>> >>sudden, the Texas crowd goes absolutely nuts.  "Whazzis?," I mutter,
>> >>awaking from my coma, "Iz we winnig?  Did wez scort?"  Alas, the answer
is
>> >>no, we were not winning and we did not score.  The largest (by far)
cheer
>> >>of the day from the Texas faithful occurred when the handlers were
walking
>> >>back to the tunnel and Bevo stopped to take a gargantuan shit all over
the
>> >>letters "S", "K", and "A" in the "Nebraska" spelled out in their end
zone.
>> >>I cheer wildly.  I pick up the empty Traveler bottle and stick my
tongue in
>> >>it.  I am thirsty.
>> >>
>> >>6:16  Nebraska fans are going berserk as I walk back to the truck.  I
would
>> >>taunt them with some off-color remarks about their parentage, but I am
too
>> >>drunk to form complete sentences.  With my last cognitive thought of
the
>> >>evening, I take solace in the fact that if we had not beaten them in
>> >>October, they would be playing Florida State for the national
championship.
>> >>
>> >>6:30  Back in the car.  On the way back to Austin for the 8:00
>> >>Texas-Arizona tip off.  We can still salvage the day!  I crack open a
beer.
>> >>  It is warm.  I don't care.
>> >>
>> >>7:12  We have stopped for gas.  I am hungry.  I go inside the store.  I
>> >>walk past the beer frig.  I notice a Zima.  I've never had a Zima.  I

U.S. focuses on Bin Laden links with Hizbullah, Arafat's Fatah 
 
SPECIAL TO WORLD TRIBUNE.COM
Friday, September 14, 2001
WASHINGTON - The United States is investigating whether a coalition of
Palestinian, Iranian and Lebanese groups joined to help launch the
suicide attacks in New York and Washington.

U.S. defense sources said the Pentagon and CIA are quickly coming to the
conclusion that Saudi billionaire fugitive Osama Bin Laden was the
sponsor of the attack. But they said Bin Laden is believed to have used
a range of Islamic groups for logistics and support.

The groups being investigated include the Fatah movement headed by
Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat, the sources said. Another
group being examined for a link to the U.S. attacks is the
Iranian-backed Hizbullah, Middle East Newsline reports.

"Most of it today points to Osama Bin Laden," Sen. Charles Grassley, the
ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, said. "But the
speculation at the end of the road is that he and his network were very
much involved with Hizbullah, Fatah and other."

Grassley was one of at least two dozen House and Senate members who were
briefed by U.S. intelligence agencies since the bombing.

A U.S. official confirmed that the administration has not ruled out that
Bin Laden was provided aid by a range of Arab and Islamic groups. But
the official said no determination has been made.

"We want to be sure we understand all the connections, not just one
connection," the official said. "As we find out who actually perpetrated
the crime, as we find out who they're connected with, as we find out who
could be considered harboring them, I think it'll come clear."

Analysts and some congressional sources said the Bush administration
appears unwilling to thoroughly investigate the involvement of Iraq in
the U.S. attacks. They said that the administration fears that targeting
Iraq would dash hopes for an Arab coalition against terrorism in the
Middle East.

Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said the United States has not yet
determined who was behind the bombing. Rumsfeld said a determination
would have to be made soon.

The administration has requested $20 billion for a counterterrorism
campaign. Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz said much of the requested
allocation would prepare the military for an expected counterattack.

"I don't think we know the breakdown yet, partly because the needs are
so enormous," Wolfowitz said. "A significant piece of this is going to
be to bring our armed forces to the highest level of preparedness."

A more mature way to deal with the situation would be to wait until the

Body:
On Thursday afternoon, I received from NRG all of the transcripts of communications that they  recorded between the parties.  Here is my short summary:
 
There are six transcripts.  Five of them seem pretty good for us.  One is truly awful.
 
Transcript 1 (May 4, 2001):   NRG's Bill Stone talks to John Zurita about trying to come to terms on the deal.  No terms are finalized.
 
Transcript 2 (May 4, 2001):  Stone calls Zurita back and proposes a price that Zurita agrees to.  However, Zurita makes it clear that although many of the terms have been agreed to, "obviously we have to get agreements signed and get the lawyers involved and all that good stuff."  Stone appears to recognize that the deal is not complete:  "So we're really not done.  Fuck."
 
Transcript 3 (May 8, 2001):  Stone simply leave a voicemail for Chuck Decker asking to get a confirm of the deal.
 
Transcript 4 (May 8, 2001):  Stone talks to Decker.  Decker says: "Rogers Herndon is in charge of that. Okay?  He has to put the pressure on the credit guys to get the credit shit put to bed.  His words, and they're not exact, but they're pretty close to this, I consider the deal done, tell Bill the deal is done, assuming that the back offices communicate the needed information."  Discussions are had about getting the credit folks together to iron out details.
 
Transcript 5 (May 16, 2001) (THE BAD TAPE):  Stone calls Zurita and sets him up, asking him a number of questions aimed at determining if there really is a binding and enforceable deal between the parties.  When Stone asks "why don't you just tell me where you guys think the deal is?," Zurita replies:  "I think -- I say the deal is done."  Stone's next question:  "Well, let me ask a question.  What happens if gas goes to two bucks tomorrow?  Do you still consider the deal done?"  Zurita's answer:  "Yep."  And there's more.  Stone next asks: "Are you guys going to stand on the deal for $70 for the five years?  I mean, I just -- I mean, I just gotta know exactly where you stand."  Zurita's answer:  "The deal is done, yes."  Ouch.  This is not good.
 
Transcript 6 (May 18, 2001):  Zurita calls Stone.  They discuss credit terms.  Stone makes several comments that indicate he realizes the deal is not done. ("The only thing, the only thing I care about is how long it's going to take to have the agreement worked out"); ("What is my concern is how far away are theyfrom getting done?").
 
Rogers, I am interested in your views after you have had an opportunity to review the tapes.  Let's talk soon.  For you others, please let me know if you want transcripts of the tapes.  
 
Andy
 
P.S. --  Under the agreement we reached with NRG for exchange of the tapes, we must trade position papers with NRG on October 25, 2001.  I will prepare the position paper later this week.

Hey Shorty,

I hope your day is going well.  We took our MD out for lunch because he is 
relocating to NY and will spend about a week in Houston a month.  Well, to 
make a short story long, we ate at Erma's (great food) but I am getting very 
sleepy (life is difficult I know) from eating way too much.  I assume we are 
going home to change into some casual/hot weather clothes before dinner 
tomorrow and I may need you to pick me up.  I am still looking for some good 
jokes that I can send to you that are funny but still moderately appropriate 
(most are completely inappropriate - I have sick friends).  Check out 
www.darwinawards.com for some funny but true stories.  I'll talk to you later.

Ted

Subject: Every day needs a little dose of levity...

Fifth grade assignment

The teacher gave her fifth grade class an assignment: 
Get their parents to tell them a story with a moral at 
the end of it. The next day the kids came back and one 
by one began to tell their stories.  

Kathy said, "My father's a farmer and we have a lot of 
egg-laying hens.  One time we were taking our eggs to 
market in a basket on the front seat of the pickup when 
we hit a bump in the road and all the eggs went flying 
and broke and made a mess."  "And what's the moral of 
the story?" Asked the teacher.  "Don't put all your eggs 
in one basket!"  "Very good," said the teacher.  

"Now, Lucy?"  

"Our family are farmers too.  But we raise chickens for 
the meat market.  We had a dozen eggs one time, but when 
they hatched we only got ten live chicks. And the moral 
to this story is, don't count your chickens until they're 
hatched."  "That was a fine story Lucy."

"Johnny do you have a story to share?"  

"Yes, ma'am, my daddy told me this story about my uncle Bob.  
Uncle Bob was a pilot in Vietnam and his plane got hit.  He 
had to bail out over enemy territory and all he had was a 
bottle of whiskey, a machine gun and a machete. He drank the 
whiskey on the way down so it wouldn't break and then he 
landed right in the middle of 100 enemy troops.  He killed 
seventy of them with the machine gun until he ran out of 
bullets, then he killed twenty more with the machete till the 
blade broke and then he killed the last ten with his bare hands."
"Good heavens," said the horrified teacher, "What kind of moral 
did your daddy tell you from that horrible story?"

"Don't fuck with Uncle Bob when he's been drinking."

Here's my thinking: Fuck Gore (excuse my French). He's worse than Bush, 
because he's more of a political robot. The logical choice is, of course, as 
Jeff pointed out, Nader. The result will be that Nader loses, Gore loses, 
and Bush wins. But, four bad years is worth the  political message it will 
send, especially if it's strong. People must perish in wars of belief! (I 
saw a movie about Communist Russia last night, so excuse the slogans.) 
Furthermore, the poor Democrats should remember the days when 'ole Ross "I 
got a pig in my pocket" Perot stole countless votes from the Republicans. In 
such an election, it's time to go with one's conscience, not the lesser of 
two evils. 
I've spoken. 
LATE!

Some phrases you wish you could say at work:

1. Ahhh...I see the fuck-up fairy has visited us again...

2. I don't know what your problem is, but I'll bet it's hard to pronounce.

3. How about never? Is never good for you?

4. I see you've set aside this special time to humiliate yourself
in  public.

5. I'll try being nicer if you'll try being smarter.

6. I don't work here. I'm a consultant.

7. I can see your point, but I still think you're full of shit.

8. I like you. You remind me of when I was young and stupid.

9. You are validating my inherent mistrust of strangers.

10. I have plenty of talent and vision.  I just don't give a damn.

11. I'm already visualizing the duct tape over your mouth.

12. Any connection between your reality and mine is purely
coincidental.

13. I'm not being rude.  You're just insignificant.

14. Yes, I am an agent of Satan, but my duties are largely ceremonial.

15. You sound reasonable.  Time to up the medication.

16. And your crybaby whiny-butt opinion would be...?

17. Do I look like a people person?

18. This isn't an office.  It's Hell with fluorescent lighting.

19. I started out with nothing & still have most of it left.

20. You!... Off my planet!

21. Does your train of thought have a caboose?

22. Errors have been made.  Others will be blamed.

23. Not all men are annoying. Some are dead.

24. I'm trying to imagine you with a personality.

25. Can I trade this job for what's behind door 1?

26. Too many freaks, not enough circuses.

27. How do I set a laser printer to stun?

28. If I throw a stick, will you leave?

FYI -- here is the summary of the transcripts relating to the dispute with NRG over contract formation
 
 
-----Original Message-----

To: Herndon, Rogers; Presto, Kevin M.
Cc: Sager, Elizabeth; Cook, Mary; Portz, David
Subject: NRG Dispute


On Thursday afternoon, I received from NRG all of the transcripts of communications that they  recorded between the parties.  Here is my short summary:
 
There are six transcripts.  Five of them seem pretty good for us.  One is truly awful.
 
Transcript 1 (May 4, 2001):   NRG's Bill Stone talks to John Zurita about trying to come to terms on the deal.  No terms are finalized.
 
Transcript 2 (May 4, 2001):  Stone calls Zurita back and proposes a price that Zurita agrees to.  However, Zurita makes it clear that although many of the terms have been agreed to, "obviously we have to get agreements signed and get the lawyers involved and all that good stuff."  Stone appears to recognize that the deal is not complete:  "So we're really not done.  Fuck."
 
Transcript 3 (May 8, 2001):  Stone simply leave a voicemail for Chuck Decker asking to get a confirm of the deal.
 
Transcript 4 (May 8, 2001):  Stone talks to Decker.  Decker says: "Rogers Herndon is in charge of that. Okay?  He has to put the pressure on the credit guys to get the credit shit put to bed.  His words, and they're not exact, but they're pretty close to this, I consider the deal done, tell Bill the deal is done, assuming that the back offices communicate the needed information."  Discussions are had about getting the credit folks together to iron out details.
 
Transcript 5 (May 16, 2001) (THE BAD TAPE):  Stone calls Zurita and sets him up, asking him a number of questions aimed at determining if there really is a binding and enforceable deal between the parties.  When Stone asks "why don't you just tell me where you guys think the deal is?," Zurita replies:  "I think -- I say the deal is done."  Stone's next question:  "Well, let me ask a question.  What happens if gas goes to two bucks tomorrow?  Do you still consider the deal done?"  Zurita's answer:  "Yep."  And there's more.  Stone next asks: "Are you guys going to stand on the deal for $70 for the five years?  I mean, I just -- I mean, I just gotta know exactly where you stand."  Zurita's answer:  "The deal is done, yes."  Ouch.  This is not good.
 
Transcript 6 (May 18, 2001):  Zurita calls Stone.  They discuss credit terms.  Stone makes several comments that indicate he realizes the deal is not done. ("The only thing, the only thing I care about is how long it's going to take to have the agreement worked out"); ("What is my concern is how far away are theyfrom getting done?").
 
Rogers, I am interested in your views after you have had an opportunity to review the tapes.  Let's talk soon.  For you others, please let me know if you want transcripts of the tapes.  
 
Andy
 
P.S. --  Under the agreement we reached with NRG for exchange of the tapes, we must trade position papers with NRG on October 25, 2001.  I will prepare the position paper later this week.

Even if my diet consisted solely of rare African roots, I'd still go to La 
Folie for your 40th. I understand that you don't want to make people do what 
they don't really want to do, but this is also about you, the celebration of 
the 40th year of your life, etc. Fuck everyone else. Anyway, from what I've 
heard, everyone's cool with Folie. After all, the wine ain't half bad. But, 
I'll be leaving all this up to the Lone Mountain Sisters (and not their 
current bluegrass boyfriends).

I'm happy to hear it's the man in black's b-day. Hopefully he'll stay around 
for many more.

LATE!

PS I meant to ask last night: what the hell are we getting Eldon for his 
birthday?

Subject: mardi gras!


all,

welcom to the official invite of the guidroz brothers mardi gras bash to be
held by me and my little brother (yes there is another) at his house in the
most beautiful and decadent city in america, new orleans.

first of all let me tell you if you have made it on this list, you are very
special to me and therefore entitled to all and any hospitality in my home
town.  there is no such thing as imposition. SO...

MARDI GRAS: what the fuck is it??  well you have heard me talk of it, but
here is a quick overview with some helpful links.  mardi gras is officially
the biggest party in america.  it is the catholic celebration of fat tuesday
and ment to get all of your partying out of your system as you enter lent
(ash wednesday). here are some links for more information and you can also
email me with questions.

http://www.mardigrasday.com

http://www.mardigras.com

http://www.fattuesday.com

also for information about my wonderful city of new orleans

http://www.nola.com

http://www.neworleans.com

this year mardi gras day is on tuesday, feburary 27th. but this is just the
last and most decadent day, the grande finally so to speak.  the party
starts about 2 weeks before and gets more manic as fat tuesday approches. so
here are the date options.

my brothers house is open to us from tuesday the 14th of feburary until
friday the 3rd of march.  you will want to be there definately for either or
both weekends of the 16th-18th and the weekend of the 22ond-24th.  the later
being more hardcore partying than the first.  if you would like to visit the
city and surrounding area (ie. river road plantations, the swamps, the
cemetaries, etc.) and some of mardi gras you would want to plan for the
first week and weekend.  if your all about not remembering what the hell you
did, but had fun, the second weekend through fat tuesday would be your bag.
of course your welcom for the 2 weeks as well.

What we provide.  my brother and i have been doing this for several years
now.  it is his job to provide the house and my job to fill it up with the
most fun and interesting people i can, thats why you guys are on my list!
it can really get crazy downtown so my brother and i kind of act as tour
guides.  also, if enough of us come, we are going to plan a crawfish boil.
(yes eric, crawfish cajun style! none of that salty cold sweedish stuff) all
you have to do is:

email me when your flight gets in to New Orleans International airport and
either you can take a cab (real close to my bros house) or someone will meet
you there.

then just tag along with the group or do your own thing.  my brother has a 3
bedroom house a few couches so chances are everyone (including me) will be
crashing all over the place, so bring some sort of backpacker type gear
(sleeping bag and stuff).

ok then.  thats it.  ill be there from the 14th to the 28th, tenitavely,
will nail that down soon.  so as we say in new orleans, "lassiere la bon
temps roullete!"

guidroz

5 out of 5 stars A great book about a great team., August 27,  2001 
Reviewer: A reader from Dallas, TX USA  
Jim  Dent's Junction Boys was one of the greatest sports books I ever read, so I  couldn't wait for his next one. It's a different kind of story, but this book is  wonderful too. Dent knows how to make his characters come alive, from the great  coach, Bud Wilkinson, to all those great players, and there were quite a few  during the Streak. No, Wilkinson isn't portrayed as a saint here, because he  wasn't--he was a human being, and that's how Dent shows him, warts and all. I'd  rather read the truth, and if John Herman Bell says "this book is as true as  true can be" (that's what he told the Daily Oklahoman), that's good enough for  me. The best part of the book is getting to know all those great players, and  reading about all those great games they played--and there were some great  games. Also, getting behind the scenes is really cool, to see how the players  and the coaches prepared (or didn't). There are a lot of funny stories, too. All  in all, a great follow-up to the great Junction Boys.

Ollie,

Congrats on hooking up with a little long-term action.  Always thought you'd be one of the first to go.  Send her down south to Portland if it looks like she's getting board with your "itsy bitsy".

I've kept in touch with Carl and Brett but not much else.  Funny how time can just slip by.  I think back to the days in school and yup...just like I thought, everything seems so cool.  I think of how nice it would be to have scores of friends within a block and three bars to choose from... but it didn't seem that super at the time.  I specifically remember getting pissed on a Tuesday night, playing darts at Shakers with throngs of 20 something girls around and shrugging it off as "boring".  

You may be suprised to hear it, but I am still on with Enron and looking forward to a buyout in a week or so.  As strange as it may seem, this whole fiscad may have been a huge blessing in disguise...I'll just keep my fingers crossed.

I'm doing a lot of skiing this year.  Let me know when and where we should meet up.  I'd like to see the likes of Toby, Ty, Nate, Ken and even Palmy.

Dear  Santa,
I've written you for three years now asking for a fire truck.  
Please, I really really want a fire truck this year! 
Love,  Joey
Dear Joey,
Let me make it up to you. Christmas Eve, while you  sleep, I'm 
gonna torch your house.  You'll have more fire trucks than  you'll 
know what to do with.
- Santa
Dear Santa,
I  don't know if you can do this, but for Christmas, I'd like for 
my mommy and  daddy to get back together. Please see what you can 
do. 
Love,  Teddy
Dear Teddy,
What, and ruin that hot affair your dad's still  having with the
babysitter?  He's banging her like a screen door in a  hurricane, 
son!  Let me get you some nice Legos instead. 
-  Santa
Dear Santa,
I left milk and cookies for you under the tree,  and I left carrots
or your reindeer outside the backdoor. 
Love,  Susan
Dear Susan,
Milk gives me the shits and carrots make the deer  fart in my face.
You want to be a kiss-ass? Leave me a glass of Chivas Regal  and 
some Toblerone.
-Santa
Dear Santa,
I really really  want a puppy this year. Please please please PLEASE
-  Jimmy
Jimmy,
That whiney-begging shit may work with your folks, but  that crap
don't work up here. You're getting a sweater again. 
-  Santa
Dear Santa,
What do you do the other 364 days of the  year? Are you making toys?
Your friend, Thomas
Dear Thomas,
All  toys get made in China. I have a condo in Vegas, where I spend
most my time  squeezing cocktail waitresses asses, and losing all 
my cash at the craps  table. Hey, YOU wanted to know! 
- Santa
Dear Santa,
I wud  like a kool toy space ranjur for Xmas. Iv ben a good boy all
yeer.
YeR  FReND, BiLLy
Dear Billy,
Nice spelling. You're on your way to being a  career lawncare 
specialist.  How 'bout I send you a fucking book so you  can learn
to read and write?  I'm giving your older brother the space  
ranger, at least HE can spell!
-Santa
Dear Santa,
I  have been a good girl all year, and the only thing I ask for is
peace and joy  in the world for everybody!  
Love, Sarah
Dear Sarah,
Your  parents smoked pot when they had you, didn't they? 
-  Santa
Dear Santa,
I need more Pokemon cards please! All my  friends have more Pokemon
cards than me. Please see what you can do.   
Love, Michelle
Dear Michelle,
It blows my fucking mind. Kids are  forcing their parents to buy 
hundreds of dollars worth of these stupid  cards, and none of you 
snot-nosed brats are even learning to play the game.  Let me get 
you something more your speed, like "Chutes and Ladders." 
-  Santa
Dear Santa,
I want a new bike, playstation, a train,  some G.I. Joes, a dog, 
a drum kit, a pony and a tuba. 
Love,  Francis
Dear Francis,
Who the fuck names their kid "Francis" nowadays?  
- Santa
Dear Santa,
Do you see us when we're sleeping, do  you really know when we're
awake, like in the song?  
Love,  Jessica
Dear Jessica,
You are that gullible? Good luck in whatever you  do, I'm skipping 
your house... 
- Santa
Dearest  Santa,
We don't have a chimney in our house, how do you get into our  home?
Love, Marky
Mark,
Firstly, stop calling yourself "Marky";  that's why you're getting
your ass whipped at school. Secondly, you don't  live in a house,

Subject:	Confirmed Worm Attack


The alert that we sent out yesterday was only half of what has now been confirmed as a "worm" attack. For those not familiar with the term, a worm is an attack program that automatically launches a new attack from each machine that it breaks into. This particular worm is attacking both Microsoft IIS servers (which we knew) and Sun Solaris systems.

The CERT advisory discussing the worm is attached below. The Solaris vulnerability is a bug that was discovered two years ago, and the patch has been available. Hopefully, very few of our systems will have this vulnerability, but two EBS servers that we are aware of have already been compromised.

Compromised Sun systems are used to launch further attacks and may be seen by others as Enron systems launching attacks. Please check immediately to ensure that all of your Internet facing servers have either had the patches installed or are not running the affected software.

We have contacted  the FBI to report these attacks. If you do discover any other compromised servers please make backups of all logs and files that may have been uploaded to the server. Please contact me if you have any questions at 713-853-9373.

Thanks,

CERT Advisory CA-2001-11 sadmind/IIS Worm

   Original release date: May 08, 2001
   Last revised: --
   Source: CERT/CC

   A complete revision history is at the end of this file.

Systems Affected

     * Systems running unpatched versions of Microsoft IIS
     * Systems running unpatched versions of Solaris up to, and
       including, Solaris 7

Overview

   The CERT/CC has received reports of a new piece of self-propagating
   malicious code (referred to here as the sadmind/IIS worm). The worm
   uses two well-known vulnerabilities to compromise systems and deface
   web pages.

I. Description

   Based on preliminary analysis, the sadmind/IIS worm exploits a
   vulnerability in Solaris systems and subsequently installs software to
   attack Microsoft IIS web servers. In addition, it includes a component
   to propagate itself automatically to other vulnerable Solaris systems.
   It will add "+ +" to the .rhosts file in the root user's home
   directory. Finally, it will modify the index.html on the host Solaris
   system after compromising 2,000 IIS systems.

   To compromise the Solaris systems, the worm takes advantage of a
   two-year-old buffer overflow vulnerability in the Solstice sadmind
   program. For more information on this vulnerability, see

          http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/28934
          http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-1999-16.html

   After successfully compromising the Solaris systems, it uses a
   seven-month-old vulnerability to compromise the IIS systems. For
   additional information about this vulnerability, see

          http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/111677

   Solaris systems that are successfully compromised via the worm exhibit
   the following characteristics:

     *
Sample syslog entry from compromised Solaris system

May  7 02:40:01 carrier.domain.com inetd[139]: /usr/sbin/sadmind: Bus Error - c
ore dumped
May  7 02:40:01 carrier.domain.com last message repeated 1 time

May  7 02:40:08 carrier.domain.com last message repeated 1 time
May  7 02:44:14 carrier.domain.com inetd[139]: /usr/sbin/sadmind: Killed
     * A rootshell listening on TCP port 600
     * Existence of the directories

     * /dev/cub contains logs of compromised machines
     * /dev/cuc contains tools that the worm uses to operate and
       propagate

     Running processes of the scripts associated with the worm, such as
   the following:
     * /bin/sh /dev/cuc/sadmin.sh
     * /dev/cuc/grabbb -t 3 -a .yyy.yyy -b .xxx.xxx 111
     * /dev/cuc/grabbb -t 3 -a .yyy.yyy -b .xxx.xxx 80
     * /bin/sh /dev/cuc/uniattack.sh
     * /bin/sh /dev/cuc/time.sh
     * /usr/sbin/inetd -s /tmp/.f
     * /bin/sleep 300

   Microsoft IIS servers that are successfully compromised exhibit the
   following characteristics:

     * Modified web pages that read as follows:
                            fuck USA Government
                               fuck PoizonBOx
                       contact:sysadmcn@yahoo.com.cn
     *

           GET /scripts/root.exe /c+echo+\
           &LT;HTML code inserted here>.././index.asp 502 -

II. Impact

   Solaris systems compromised by this worm are being used to scan and
   compromise other Solaris and IIS systems. IIS systems compromised by
   this worm can suffer modified web content.

   Intruders can use the vulnerabilities exploited by this worm to
   execute arbitrary code with root privileges on vulnerable Solaris
   systems, and arbitrary commands with the privileges of the
   IUSR_machinename account on vulnerable Windows systems.

   We are receiving reports of other activity, including one report of
   files being destroyed on the compromised Windows machine, rendering
   them unbootable. It is unclear at this time if this activity is
   directly related to this worm.

III. Solutions

Apply a patch from your vendor

   A patch is available from Microsoft at

          http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS00-078.asp

          For IIS Version 4:

from a friend in Austin....
The uncut version.

i went to both the am and the pm practices yesterday, and let me
re-re-re-iterate that we have a great group of receivers and that the stud
dog bad ass mofo of the group is roy williams.  he is physically way beyond
not only vasher and the walkon CBs trying to cover him, but the rest of the
college ranks.  ahmad brooks was standing by him in street clothes, and
there ain't a chance he could stop roy.  roy flies past people and gets way
the fuck up there and takes the ball out of the clouds.  he's a fucking
randy moss, but you know what?  he's bigger than randy moss and as fast as
randy moss and probably has as good a vertical as randy moss:

Roy
height: 6'5"
weight: 210 lbs.
40 speed: 4.3
100 speed: 10.38
high jump: 6'10"
long jump: 24'

we may just have the next superhuman WR on our team.  pray for no injuries.
i'm going to the pm practice today, too.  got a hard-on just thinking about
roy.  probably will see a few NFL GMs there.

and the other WRs are spectacular, too.  sloan is 6'2" and does well at
establishing and holding position vs. the cover man.  BJ is 6'1" and has
really soft hands.  i watched BJ, vasher and jeffrey field 12-15 punts each
at 60 yds with a cross wind in the pm session.  vasher and jeffrey had
technical problems and bobbled or dropped almost half.  BJ never bobbled or
dropped one.  as soon as it's close, he just sucks it in and takes off.  and
that's how he catches balls on the crossing routes.  vacuum hands.

it's going to be unfuckingreal a year or two down the road when these guys
have experience and simms gets to throw to them on the field three at a
time.  you can't doubleteam them all.

put simply, i think the days of our using white 5'7" WRs are over.

Subject:	Quality Moves to utilize on your next date

God Bless America. If anyone uses one of these moves please report back to me with your results.  I will attempt the Shanghai Shampoo on my date tonight.

HOW TO IMPRESS YOUR GIRLFRIEND
These are techniques that have been sent to me by various Bunthaus heads. I want to again stress that in no way do we condone the techniques listed here or practice these. Except maybe the Turkey Shoot and the Rear Admiral. And definitely the Spicey Stanley.
Here is a fairly extensive compilation of some of the extraordinary sexual activities that can be performed by men: 
1. Tea bag - As you are sitting on a girl's face, repeatedly dip your scrotum in and out of her mouth, similar to a tea bag in a cup of hot water. An old favorite. 
2. Hot Lunch - While receiving head from a woman, you shit on her chest. (a.k.a. the Cleveland Steamer)
3. The Stranger - Sitting on your hand until it falls asleep and then jerking off, eliciting the feeling of a hand job from someone else.
4. Donkey Punch - Banging a girl doggy style and then moments before you cum, sticking your dick in her ass, and then punching her in the back of the head. This gives a tremendous sensation, but for it to work correctly, the girl must be knocked out so that her asshole tightens up.
5. Golden Shower - Any form of peeing on a girl. (aka: watersports)
6. Pearl Necklace - Well known. Whenever you cum on the neck/cleavage area of a girl, it takes on the look of beautiful jewelry.
7. Coyote - This occurs when you wake up in the room of a nasty skank and you know you've got to give her the slip. However, you realize that your arm is wrapped around her. Therefore, you must gnaw off your own arm to get out of this situation. Can be very painful.
8. Purple Mushroom - This occurs when a woman is giving you oral sex and you withdraw your penis in order to poke it back into her cheek. It should leave a lasting impression similar to a purple mushroom.
9. The Flying Camel - A personal favorite. As she is lying on her back and you are hammering her from your knees, you carefully balance yourself without using your arms to prop yourself up. You then to flap your arms and let out a long, shrieking howl. Strictly a class move. 
10. Double Fishhook - From the doggy-style position, you hook your pinky fingers in her mouth and pull back to achieve deeper penetration.
11. The Ram - Again, you're attacking from behind, when you start ramming her head against the wall in a rhythmic motion. The force of the wall should allow for deeper penetration. Very handy for those lulls in penile sensitivity.
12. Dog in a Bathtub - This is the proper name for when you attempt to insert your nuts into a girl's ass. It is so named because it can be just as hard as keeping a dog in the tub while giving it a bath.
13. The Bronco - Back to reality with this classic. You start by going doggy style and then just when she is really enjoying it, you grab onto her tits as tightly as possible and yell another girl's name. This gives you the feeling of riding a bronco as she tries to buck you off. 
14. Pink Glove - This frequently happens during sex when a girl is not wet enough. When you pull out to give her the money, the inside of her twat sticks to your hog. Thus, the pink glove.
15. The Fountain of You - While sitting on her face and having her eat your ass, jerk off like a madman. Build up as much pressure as possible before releasing, spewing like a venerable geyser all over her face, neck and tits. (Better in her bed) 
16. New York Style Taco - Anytime when you are so drunk that when you go down on her, you puke on her box. Happy trails!
17. Dirty Sanchez - While banging a girl doggy style, quickly stick 2 fingers deep into her starfish, then reach around and wipe the residue on her upper lip, providing her a mustache.
18. Western Grip - When jerking off, turn your hand around, so that your thumb is facing towards you. It is the same grip that rodeo folks use; hence, western. 
19. The Blumpkin - You need to find a real tramp to do this right. It involves having her suck you off while you're on the shitter.
20. The Bismark - Another one involving oral sex. Right before you are about to spew, pull out and shoot all over her face. Follow that with a punch and smear the blood and jism together.
21. Jelly Doughnut - A derivation of the Bismark. All you have to do is punch her in the nose while you are getting head. 
22. Woody Woodpecker - While a chick is sucking on your balls, repeatedly tap the head of your cock on her forehead.
23. Tossing salad - Well known by now. A prison act where one person is forced to chow starfish with the help of whatever condiments are available, i.e. Jello, jism, etc
24. The Fish Eye - Working from behind, you shove your finger in her pooper. Thereupon, she turns around in a one-eyed winking motion to see what the hell you are doing.
25. Tuna Melt - You're down on a chick, lapping away, and you discover that it's her time of the month. By no means do you stop though. When the whale spews, tartar sauce with a hint of raspberry smothers your face. 
26. The Fur Ball - You're chomping away at some mighty Zena who has a mane between her legs the size of Lionel Richie's afro, when a mammoth fur ball gets lodged in your throat. You punch her. 
27. The Chili Dog - You take a dump on the girl's chest and then titty fuck her.
28. Gaylord Perry - Going to only one knuckle during an anal probe is for wimps. Make this famous knuckle-ball pitcher proud and use multiple digits on that virgin corn hole. A minimum of 2 knuckles required (either on one finger or on multiple). 
29. The Rear Admiral - An absolute blast. When getting a chick from behind (with both partners standing), make sure you don't let her grab onto anything when she is bent over. Then, drive your hips into her backside so that the momentum pushes her forward. The goal is to push her into a wall or table, or have her trip and fall on her face. You attain the status of Admiral when you can push her around the room without crashing into anything and not using your hands to grab onto her hips.
30. Glass Bottom Boat - Putting saran wrap over the skank's face and taking a dump.
31. Ray Bans - Put your nuts over her eye sockets while getting head. You're can is on her forehead. Yes, it may be anatomically impossible, but it is definitely worth a try. 
32. The Snowmobile - When plugging a girl while she's on all fours, reach around and sweep out her arms so she falls on her face. 
33. The Dutch Oven - Also well known. Whenever you fart while humping, pull the covers over her head. Don't let her out until all movement ceases. 
34. Smoking Pole - Self Explanatory. Don't use fire.
35. Rusty Trombone - Getting the reacharound while getting your salad tossed. Also known as milking the prostate.
36. Turkey Shoot - When you're coming, come on her face and let it drip off her chin so it looks like that red shit on the turkey's chin.
37. Stovepiping - Taking it in the Tush.
38. Rusty Anchor - After a healthy term of the Stovepiping, the recipient gets to enjoy a good fudgesicle.
39. Sandpiper - A stovepiping on the local beach, desert, or playground sandbox. Also known as the Sandblast. 
40. Lucky Pierre - the middle man in a three way buttfuck. Also known as the french sandwich.
UPDATED!!!! NEW LISTINGS!!!!
41.Divortex- A mystical place into which old friends are sucked when a married couple splits up.
42.Blump- To suck someone's dick while they are taking a dump.
43.Bustard- A very rude bus driver.
44.Cold Faithful- Blowing your visibly-steaming load outside in the winter-time, like when you get your cock sucked on a ski-lift.
45.Grand pappy smash- To beat your meat so hardcore that it starts to chafe and bleed.
46.Esplanade- To attempt an explanation while drunk.
47.Flatulence- The emergency vehicle that picks you up after you are run over by a steamroller. 
48.Butt Rodeo- When you're going at it with a girl, you flip her over real fast, start ramming her in the ass and yell as loud as possible "BUTT RODEO!" You then see how long you can ride her till she tosses ya off!
49.Bargoyle- The hideous old hair-spray hag who seems to live at your local watering hole. She usually smokes endlessly, spends hundreds of dollars a night on video-poker, and makes sexually threatening comments to frightened college freshmen.
50.Pasteurize- Once you get her hairy bush pasteurize, you got it licked!
51.Beerelevant- A point which does not seem to be particularly important, given enough beer
52.Mangry- Describing the anger of women who are angry at men, specifically. "She's such a bitch, she's just plain mangry."
53.Clitourist- A man who won't stop and ask for directions in bed. ie: "Because of his fouled foreplay, Suzy realized that her new boyfriend was no experienced bedroom traveler, but merely a clitourist." 
54.Stuffucking- The act of "stuffing in" your limp, helpless member in hopes of getting it up. Potential causes: you're too drunk or she's too ugly. (see also; Fugly)
55.Antlers- Wide, flat, flapjack titties that come to a sharp point at the nipples.
56.The Kangmin - while a girl is reciting bad poetry, you take her from behind. 
57.The Flaming Amazon- This one's for all you pyromaniacs out there. When you're screwing some chick, right when your about to cum, pull out and quickly grab the nearest lighter and set her pubes on fire, then extinguish the flames with your jizz!
58.The Screwnicorn -When a dyke puts her strap-on dildo on her forehead and proceeds to go at her partner like a crazed unicorn.
59.Split pissonality -When you're taking a leak and you get two streams out of the one hole! 
60.A Short in the Cord- A "code" phrase used by the common man to refer to Testicular Tendon Tangle Syndrome. Ex. "Oh fuck! My nuts are killing me... I think I've got a short in the cord." 
61.Old Jism Trail -The stream of semen oozing down the chin and chest of someone who has just finished fellating a senior citizen.
62.Abdicate -To give up all hope of ever having a flat stomach. 
63.Lymph -To walk with a lisp. 
64.Anal Boot- An anal boot is when you take a pitcher of beer, everyone spits in it, someone stirs it with their cock and then the mixture is poured through the crack of a man ass into the waiting mouth of the loser of a bet or drinking game. 
65.Australian Death Grip- The act of grabbing a woman by the haunches/crotch and staring deeply into her eyes until you're slapped or kissed. A recommended tactic for very crowded bars. Another great opportunity for wagering among friends.
66.Fumilingus -When a man (or woman) performs cunnilingus on a woman and she farts directly in his/her face. 
67.Intoxicourse- Having sexual intercourse whilst piss-drunk.
68.Valsalva -The act of pinching shut (with thumb and forefinger) a woman's nose while receiving fellatio; most effective when employed just prior to the release point due to the gag reflex and ensuing swallow that the woman is forced to do to continue breathing. A great first date ploy, as it sets the stage for what the rules of engagement will be going forward.
69.Insta-gasm -Pre-mature ejaculation at the sight of a beautiful woman. ie: "She was so fine, I had an insta-gasm before I could get her clothes off!"
70.Manual Deconstipation -This is where you get out the hand cream and go in manually for the hammerhead by breaking it into smaller chunks and pulling it out a piece at a time.
71.Post Poodum Syndrome -The feeling of depression felt after successful removal of a hammerhead. The excitement has passed, and you must now find something else to occupy your time.
72.The Homolic Maneuver -Using your penis to dislodge an object blocking a choking victim's windpipe. 
73.Pegging - having a female take you in the rear with a strap on. 
74. The UnderDog - after a hard session at the gym, your armpit muscle begins to twitch; thus giving you the ability to jerk a guy off with your armpit muscle. 
75. The Twinkler - when you are 69ing a girl and you shove your dick into mouth hard, and you watch her a-hole "twinkle" as she gags. 
76. Angry dragon - This involves the girl giving the guy head and as he is about to cum slapping the girl on the back of the head causing the cum to come out her nose. Great care should be used to not slap her mouth shut.
77. Tony Danza - a takeoff of the donkey punch is called the Tony Danza. When you are about to cum while doing a girl from behind, you say "who's the boss?" and stick it in her ass. Before she says anything you shout "TONY DANZA!" and punch her in the back of the head.
78. Alaskan firedragon - another good take off is one of the angry dragon that is called the alaskan firedragon. When a girl is giving you a blowjob, cum in her mouth unexpectedly and plug up her mouth at the same time. Then whisper in her ear "i have syphilis" so she spews it out her nose.
79. The Walrus - when she's giving u a blowjob and u cum in her mouth unexpectadly, cover up her mouth and punch her in the stomach. 
80. The Fat Lip - If you get poison ivy and finger a girl, her labia lips will swell. A la, the fat lip.
81. Sleeping Bag - If you're going down on a really fat girl, you pull her enormous stomach roll of fat over your head.
82. Hummer Bird - when a girl is giving a guy a hummer, and he's enjoying it, she bites on his bird. 
83. Bloody Mary - when a drunk guy is going down on a girl and without even realizing it after he's done, he realizes Mary was very Bloody
84. The Houdini - this maneuver is accomplished while going at it doggy style. As you feel you are about to cum, you pull out and spit on the small of her back (making her think you've finished...). It's at the point when she turns around when *BAM!* You bust your load in her face (in the eye if you've got proper aiming techniques down.) Also known as the Doug Hennings and the David Copperfield.
85. Upperdecking - This one takes practice. This maneuver requires a toilet with a tank above it, like the ones in most homes. Instead of crapping in the bowl, you shit in the tank (i.e. upperdecking). Now don't flush. When the following victim flushes, the rancid waste fills the bowl. If you play your cards right, it may ferment 
86. Journey into darkness - This is the most disturbing of all. It entails shitting into another person's asshole. Not for beginners.
87. Rocky Balboa - dont shower for 2 weeks, then diarrhea down her throat at any point during sexual contact.
88. Rocky Balboa Title Punch - same as the Rocky Balboa, but in that non-showering 2 weeks all you eat is corn. 
I don't usually do this, but I have to give credit to Sascha and Zach for the next 2. I'm only doing this because they are my bosses kids... 
89. The McDonald's Quick Draw - Get your girlfriend to talk dirty into the intercom, making the order guy start to beat off. Then while pulling up to the window, have her give you falatio till you are about to blow your beefy chunk-load. Upon pulling up to the window, tell your girl friend to yell "Draw!". Then on "three", both you and the guy blow your loads either on her or eachother.
90. Uncle Jemima - the typical dirty chef at your local Denny's or other low-class food establishment who occasionally becomes disgruntled, and takes out his frustration on your meal, via "the ass wipe" or the "French Toast Strut" seen in Road Trip. 
91. Airtight - this is where a girl has a cock in each of her three holes, hence, airtight.
92. The Throne of Lightning - This is done by fucking a girl while you shit in a toilet. When you're going to blow your load, turn her over and dunk her head in the toilet, while she's bobbing for your turd plummet a river of semen in her ass. Not to be confused with "Ride the Lightning," a Metallica album
93. Abe Lincoln - You're getting a girl up the ass and give her a swift donkey punch to the back of her head, knocking her unconscious. You then turn her around and jerk off and blow your load all over her face. Then you shave her beaver and take the clippings and spread it where you jizzed on her, making a beard that looks like good ol Honest Abe's. 
94. Thanksgiving - Just like the holiday, Thanksgiving is when you do a girl and then she puts her two big butt cheeks on your face like holiday hams. An overcooked thanksgiving is similar to this but instead of just putting the cheeks on your head she farts on it too. 
95. PEUM - An acronym coined by a group of drunk assholes that defines the annoying (and uncontrollable) tendency to piss in multiple directions after a raucous fuck: Post-Ejaculatory Urinary Misfire. 
96. The Beverly Hills Whiffer -This move is restricted to those women who think they're God's gift to the world. Find a woman of the above description. Take her home and start doggie styling her. When you're about to blow, corkscrew two fingers into her ass, scraping as much shit as you can from her. Pull out your fingers, reach around her head to stick one finger in each nostril. Pull her head back so she can see you while you yell "So, you think your shit don't stink now ?!" 
97. Shanghai Shampoo - Fuck a chick until you've built up a load large enough to paint a room. Blow it all in her hair, rub it in thoroughly. When it dries it will resemble the crunchy noodles often served with chop suey. 
98 . Frosting the Cake - When you are about to cum, blow a load all over her chest. Then take your dick and evenly spread the Jism around the breasts and over the nipples. Then stick some candles on it and start singing "Happy Birthday." Then blow out the candles 
99. Spicey Stanley - When a girl takes hot sauce and pours it on your cock. She then proceeds to give you a blowjob, making sure all of the hot sauce is gone.

My Dear Beta Brothers:

    I would like to report on the fabulous show of support displayed by my
many Beta brothers this weekend at my book unveiling in Norman -- Woody,
Benson and Grumbles from Dallas; Porter and C-Ci from Tulsa, along with
Strange and Ellsworth from OKC. Hess tried to get there, but a cancellation
in the original party venue kept us from seeing him.

    Thank God I am a Beta. I was touched beyond belief to see your smiling
faces Friday night, especially during a time when I am catching shit here.
The original party was cancelled three days in advance a Nazi named Dr.
David Boren, the president of OU (and faggot), who was pressured by the
monied assholes, who were siced on me by Jay Wilkinson, who didn't like the
things I wrote about his father, which, the way, are true.

     My brothers were wonderful this weekend, in spite of the fact that
Woody heckled me during my speech, and Grumbles tried to hustle my best
Sunday girl. I guess Woody had a right. He drove all the way from Atlanta,
then had to turn around drive back to Dallas after the party. But, Woody,
you still owe me for conspiring with Hutch to shut me out of the Beta
offense.

    Back to Hess. My most humble apology. (I have sent a personal email to
Hess). I thought everyone knew that the party had moved, but, as it turned
out, he slipped through the cracks. I put a notice on the Beta wire about
the change and signs were posted at the Sam Noble Museum. By by the time
Hess arrived, the place was dark and closed. Sorry brother Hess. I will make
it up to you somehow.

    Guys, you are the greatest, and the best friends I've ever had in my
life.

Brother Del Dent

I still see her now and then but she lives a rock star life and I don't have the stamina to go out 4 nights a week and get up at 4:30 for work. A little old for my taste as well. She is hot though. She looks exactly like Mariah Carey. It is great hanging out with her. It is amazing how much more interested other chicks are in a guy who hanging out with a bunch if hotties. Her best friend does the social "buzz" show in Houston's NBC station so she gets ticket and invites to every thing cool around town.

                              Coming to town Thursday for the weekend and
         hopefully
               moving
                  by
                        the
                              middle
                              of September. Spending Friday house shopping.
   I
         think
            I
               am
                     going
                        to
                           end
                              up
                              in your neck of the woods. Seems like the
   best
         values
            are
               in
                     that
                           area.
                              Are
                              we going to get some snow this winter? We
   need
      to
         find
                  Dorland
                     a
                           date. I
                              am
                              going to a wedding this weekend and there
   should
      be
            lots
               of
                     single
                              chicas
                              there. I am really looking forward to being
   back
      in
            Cow
                  town.
                        Houston

                              Coming to town Thursday for the weekend and

               moving

   I

               am
                     going

                              we going to get some snow this winter? We

                              going to a wedding this weekend and there

Subject:	Re: Blanchard


As we all know, Blanchard was a GDI his first semester at LSU.  While living in Power dorm, Blanchard once overheard one of the Pi PHi for boys that he was hanging out with say "Hey, Dude, Sorority girls are hot!"  Blanchard, being from Paincourteville and not being what we would call a 'master' of the English language, though that this 'fresh' Pi Phi meant "All greek girls are good in bed."  So what did Blanchard do.  He went out and found the first GREEK girl he could, and he started dating her.  After many pleasant years, (some of which I will not mention for Tim's sake, and mine)  Tim and his Greek Goddess are engaged.  Yes, that's right.  Tim took Lenhart's advice (because we all know that Lenhart is the authority on relationships with the opposite sex; I mean, who wouldn't take his advice) and Tim decided to start his life sentence with a lovely girl who has bunch of friends who all give it up like it was going out o! f style.  
 
Tim's wedding is on THE DAY OF THE MISSISSIPPI STATE GAME.  For those of you who are not Tiger fans (which seems to be most of you these days), that is Oct. 20th.  I know, it is an away game, which is better than having a wedding on a home game.  But some of us who are fans like to go to the out of town games.  True story, here.  I went to a wedding with Louise and her mother on Friday night.  You have not lived until you take two dates to a wedding, one of whom is engaged to your good friend and the other whom cannot speak the language.  Anyway, after the wedding that we attended, Louise's mom asked me if I would prefer Tim's wedding ceremony be in either half English and half Greek, or all in Greek.  I responded "I do not care.  I will be listening to the LSU game on my headphones anyway."  I know what some of you are saying, it is only one game.  Yes, and I am sure that was the only weekend they could hav! e it since so many of us from New Orleans have been to a wedding at the Greek Cultural Center, because all of us from New Orleans have been to numerous weddings / goat roasts there.  Anyway, it is a done deal, and we are all happy for the couple.
 
The real point of this e-mail is to organize Tim's bachelor party.  We have it planned for the weekend of September 22 (what a novel idea!!!  Plan a wedding event on a weekend where there is neither an LSU event, nor Jazz Fest!!!)  We are planning to go to Vegas.  As per our current plans, we would leave on that Thursday (the 20th, I think) and return on Sunday.  'Paw Paw' Blanchard heard that in September, his game of choice really starts hitting, that of course would be the nickel slots.  'Paw Paw' already has his Panama Jack hat, his         "Geaux Dinar-deaux" T-shirt, his jams, and his black socks with brown leather sandals packed and ready.  His fanny pack is stuffed with Twinkies and silver dimes.  He is really fired up about the $1.99 shrimp cocktail (early bird special, of course.)
The plans are to get there Thursday night (Nicky, get more drink tickets.)  Thursday night we can get settled, possibly gamble a bit.  On Friday, maybe play golf (although I will probably be too drunk / hung over / missing for an early tee time.)  On Friday night, we can go "clubbin'", as I am sure The Tricky Texas Trio (Lenhart, Landry, and Mitch) will want to do.  On Saturday, Tim wants to wake up early, get the sports section of the Advocate, drink coffee, and bitch about the Tigers.  Instead, we are going to watch and bet on College Football all day.
Saturday night, Tim wants to go see Sigfried and Roy.  However, we are not doing that.  If he wants to see gay men play with caged tigers, he can find out the next time Nesbitt tries out for the LSU cheerleading team.  Instead, either SaturDay or Friday night, myself and a select group (yet to be determined, but including Lenhart if he is not doing his best Ricky Martin impression at Club C2K) will go on a recon mission to the Deja Vu.  Therefore, on Saturday night, we will have entertainment in the room that some of us have seen before, and who know what is expected of them (that way Lenhart will not make the entertainment  cry when he asks them to fuck his Elway blow-up doll).  Remember Tim.  If you use a strap on, it is not considered cheating.  I am a future lawyer.  I should know.
This weekend is September 22.  There is no excuse for you to come up with when you have this much notice.  Out of money?  Bullshit.  Save up until then.  Have to work?  Bullshit.  Take a vacation day.  Actually, September will be the first month that I will be gainfully employed.  But, I know that my boss, the Honorable G.Thomas Porteous, will let me off for one day if debauchery will be had, although I may have to put a few hundreds on black for him periodically throughout the weekend.
For those of you who will be recently married, I already have an excuse for you.  "Honey, Tim came to all OUR wedding functions.  The least I can do is return the favor."
For those of you that will be married shortly after Tim, I also have an excuse. "Baby / Schmoopy / I wish your tits were as big as Mindy/, if want other people to come to our wedding functions, then I have to attend theirs."  For all of you single guys, no excuse.
Please respond to this e-mail at your earliest convenience, or I will see ya'll this weekend.  All plans are subject to change.  (Chad, if you want to send an e-mail to only me, hit 'Reply to sender.'  If you hit 'Reply to all'. it sends the message to all of the RECEPIENTS of the original message.  I know that you said Law School was such a stupid idea compared to Business School, but I think you could learn from some of our lessons, such as it is better to remain silent and be thought of as a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt.)
 
Hope this e-mail finds you doing well.
 
Signed,
Granola, Blarry, your Daddy, Mushroom head, Captain Nic, King, Smokey, charming drunk, your heighness, the one who never looses his emotions when he drinks, SG Nerd, Governor, lawyer, or anything else you want to call me.

                                    Coming to town Thursday for the weekend

               hopefully
                     moving

      shopping.
         I
               think

                     am

                                    in your neck of the woods. Seems like
   the
         best
               values
                  are

                                    we going to get some snow this winter?
   We
         need
            to
               find
                        Dorland

                                    am
                                    going to a wedding this weekend and

         should

Subject: The True Story of a Private Equity "Stud"


As you may know, the only person more arrogant than an investment banker is
someone in private equity.  Investment bankers pride themselves on making
vast amounts of money, but a successful private equity professional takes
devilish pride and supports an even bigger ego for working fewer hours while
making even more money than his (rarely her) investment banking brethren.
Unfortunately, some members of the private equity community mistakenly
believe that their growing wealth is the result of their own talent and
charming personality rather than a simple profiting from the hoarding of
capital, as Karl Marx so astutely described.

Consider the plight of Peter Chung (see attached email), a recent hire at
the Carlyle Group.  After completing his two-year stint as an Analyst at
Merrill Lynch, Chung was persuaded to seek out new opportunities in Korea
working as part of Carlyle's vast Asian investment team.  Working at a
private equity firm allows Chung to check out Korean night clubs (which
would be legally classified as brothels in the United States) 3-4 times a
week, though Chung made it clear that he needs only two months to "learn a
little bit of the buyside business" so he can begin nightly visits.  Already
a self-described "stud" on the New York City dating scene, Chung looked to
the emerging island of Korea where the standard of living for young foreign
men is bolstered by the low per capita income of native residents (roughly
$12,600 per person).  By making in excess of ten times the average national
wage, Chung quickly found himself to be quite the ladies man as the locals
were attracted to his fat wallet and U.S. citizenship.  Thus bolstered by an
initial rendezvous or two, Chung decided to cement his legacy by setting out
on the quixotic mission to sleep with all of the fine women of Korea.

As of May 15, 2001, Chung alludes to having had sexual relations with five
"hot chicks."  According to Chung's own calculations, there are roughly one
billion "hot chicks" remaining in Korea.  Clearly there is a break in
Chung's sexual predator model as he apparently believes that not only is the
global female population of 3 billion comprised of 1/3 hot Korean chicks,
but he will be able to sleep with that many before his finest member falls
off or he dies of exhaustion.  Sadly, Chung cannot complete his mission
alone.  The quality of prophylactics in Korea are not quite up to U.S.
standards (Chung would probably claim Korean condoms are too small) and he
needs your help to continue his quest for infamy.  If you would like to
contribute to this valiant mission, please direct your gift of a
FDA-approved "domes" to the address below:

Peter Chung
The Carlyle Group
Suite 1009, CCMM Bldg.
12, Yoido-dong, Youngdeungpo-ku
Seoul 150-010, Korea

Chung asks that you consider using FedEx or another international overnight
courier since he may be on the verge of running out of protection.
Alternatively, if you would like to pursue a job working for The Carlyle
Group in Korea, write to the following address:

The Honorable James A. Baker
1001 Pennsylvania Avenue NW
Suite 220 South
Washington, DC 20004-2505

Please note that Mr. Baker, the lead spokesperson for The Carlyle Group, a
the former Secretary of State from the George Herbert Walker Bush
Administration.  Since leaving the White House, Jim Baker has continued his
international mission to spread goodwill and STDs throughout the world by
supporting young Romeos such as Mr. Chung.

For a first-hand account of life in private equity, please read Peter
Chung's travelogue (attached).  Please keep in mind that Chung's experience
is partially a function of his prior status as a "stud" and may not be
reflective of private equity experiences in general.  Not all of us can hope
to be as smart, debonair and modest as Mr. Chung.

Regards,

Justin

So I've been in Korea for about a week and a half now and what can I say,
LIFE IS GOOD....

I've got a spanking brand new 2000 sq. foot 3 bedroom apt. with a 200 sq.
foot terrace running the entire length of my apartment with a view
overlooking Korea's main river and nightline......Why do I need 3 bedrooms?
Good question,.... the main bedroom is for my queen size bed,...where CHUNG
is going to fuck every hot chick in Korea over the next 2 years (5 down,
1,000,000,000 left to go).... the second bedroom is for my harem of
chickies, and the third bedroom is for all of you fuckers when you come out
to visit my ass in Korea.  I go out to Korea's finest clubs, bars and
lounges pretty much every other night on the weekdays and everyday on the
weekends to (I think in about 2 months, after I learn a little bit of the
buyside business I'll probably go out every night on the weekdays).  I know
I was a stud in NYC but I pretty much get about, on average, 5-8 phone
numbers a night and at least 3 hot chicks that say that they want to go
home with me every night I go out.  I love the buyside,.... I have bankers
calling me everyday with opportunties and they pretty much cater to my
every whim - you know (golfing events, lavish dinners, a night out
clubbing). The guys I work with are also all chilll - I live in the same
apt building as my VP and he drives me around in his Porsche (1 of 3 in all
of Korea) to work and when we go out.  What can I say,.... live is good,...
CHUNG is KING of his domain here in Seoul.....

So,.... all of you fuckers better keep in touch and start making plans to
come out and visit my ass ASAP, I'll show you guys an unbelievable
time....My contact info is below....
Oh, by the way,... someone's gotta start fedexing me boxes of domes,...I
brought out about 40 but I think I'll run out of them by Saturday.....

Laters,
CHUNG

The reason I asked about Chris Sevrens is that he was on the list (you'll see) of this email.  I don't know if you heard about it but
the author of the email got fired shortly after it circulated through Wall St.  Anyway, thought you might find it amusing.  Start from
the bottom of this email and work your way up.  It's interesting to see the path it took to so many people.  You'll see Sevrens name
near the bottom.
